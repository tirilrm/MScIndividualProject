            "Germany’s nuclear phaseout has led to a significant contraction of its nuclear power plant and services sector, but the industry is aiming to show it has a long-term future by turning to international markets while also targeting activities at home that could be worth up to €1bn ($1.08bn) per reactor, Berlin-based industry group KernD told NucNet.",
            "It is hardly surprising Germany is looking for a slice of the decommissioning pie. According to a 2022 study by EY-Parthenon, Ernst & Young’s strategy consulting arm, the global nuclear decommissioning market is worth an estimated $125bn (€115bn) to $135bn from 2021 to 2050.",
            "EY-Parthenon identifies those countries that will contribute most to the evolving market in nuclear decommissioning.",
            "Japan is top, with a decommissioning market value of around $40bn, followed by the US at $32bn and the UK at $24bn. France follows at $8bn and Germany at around $6bn. Together, these countries, which implemented the most ambitious nuclear programmes throughout the 1970s and 1980s, make up more than 80% of the global market.",
            "Almost all of these countries are at the start of their nuclear decommissioning programmes. Germany is the exception. Its decommissioning process will be completed sooner, by 2050, due to “an early political” decision to exit from nuclear and transition to renewables in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, EY-Parthenon said.",

            "The German Institute for Economic Research said in a paper that dismantling activities in Germany could be worth up to €1bn per reactor.",
            "Germany has still got “a broad capacity of nuclear capabilities available that can cover the areas of new build, service and maintenance, fuel, long-term operation and safety upgrades, decommissioning and waste management”, KernD chairman Thomas Seipolt told NucNet.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important [nuclear power] business within Germany,” Seipolt said.",
            "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed to the significance of the nuclear decommissioning market. As many nuclear plants near the end of their life cycle, a new industry based around decommissioning nuclear facilities is emerging. ",
            "In addition to nuclear plants themselves, many other facilities involved in the nuclear fuel cycle, such as research centres and facilities for reprocessing spent fuel or for waste treatment, will need to be decommissioned. ",
            "In total, it is likely that several hundred billion dollars will be spent on decommissioning worldwide between now and 2050, and businesses and investors are already securing their positions, the IAEA said.",
            "There are 420 nuclear power reactors in operation around the world, according to the IAEA. Around 200 are expected to begin the decommissioning process by 2050. ",
            "Orano, the France-based multinational nuclear company that has an office in Frankfurt, has said the German government’s decision to abandon nuclear power will generate significant business in the reactor dismantling sector over the coming years, with the majority of contracts already being allocated.",
            "KernD spokesperson Nicolas Wendler said the industry has been “reorienting towards international markets”. ",
            "KernD admits Germany is often perceived as synonymous with criticism of nuclear energy. What is often overlooked is that it has built up a portfolio of expertise in nuclear energy and nuclear technology that is largely still available today. Nuclear research began in Germany in the 1950s and until March 2011 it generated one-quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy with 17 reactors.",
            "According to KernD, Germany’s expertise in decommissioning has expanded in recent years with key players able to handle the entire portfolio of dismantling and decontamination services. Major companies such as Framatome, Westinghouse and Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service (GNS) are supported by numerous specialist companies that offer radiation protection, the operation of waste processing centres and documentation services. ",
            "“The fact that most European countries that use nuclear energy have abandoned phaseout policies and are continuing to extend the lifetimes of nuclear power plants means that this business area can continue to exist for quite a long time,” KernD said. ",
            "Almost one year ago, in April 2023, Germany took its last three nuclear reactors offline  in a decision that critics warned would only lead to more fossil fuels being burned to generate electricity. ",
            "Since the shutdowns, three political parties have called for a reversal of the anti-nuclear policy with leading members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) saying they want to restart decommissioned reactors and build new ones. ",
            "CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a “black day for Germany”. The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down — citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.",
            "Germany’s nuclear industry also stands ready to make a significant contribution in the market for services related to new build. ",
            "“The major challenge for the western nuclear industry is to build [nuclear plants] on time and on budget,” Wendler said. “Streamlining construction, tightening quality control and having a reliable and precise supply chain is what the German industry should develop.",
            "Wendler noted that Framatome and Westinghouse subsidiaries in Germany have been involved in new build projects. The Olkiluoto-3 construction project in Finland was in effect run from Germany with Areva NP and Siemens as the main contractors, he said.",
            "Anglo-German-Dutch uranium enricher Urenco operates a plant in Gronau, northwest Germany, which accounts for about 17% of Europe’s uranium enrichment capacity. This places Germany among the few countries that have centrifuge technology, a fundamental pillar of the nuclear industry supply chain.",
            "One of the strengths of German industry is that it has a tight-knit network of companies and research institutions that can bring knowhow to all sorts of engineering and manufacturing problems.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important {nuclear power} business within Germany,” Wendler said.",
            "“Many companies are seeking people to hire for a buildup in engineering and manufacturing capacities. This is due to a growing international market that has been energised by both the drive for political climate action and the geopolitical upheaval in consequence of the war in Ukraine.”",
            "In principle, said Wendler, there is a place for Germany in the development of new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors, although “this will depend on which SMRs we are talking about”. ",
            "Traditional light-water reactor designs based on the general type that have operated in Germany for decades could be supplied and supported by German supply chains. This means German industry could potentially work well for the Westinghouse AP300 SMR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 and the SMR being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK.",
            "“As for advanced reactors it is difficult to tell,” Wendler said. “I know that there are component manufacturers already developing parts or sub-systems for advanced reactors and the analytical and development capabilities available in Germany can be useful in this area.” ",
            "There are hopeful signals for the continuation of federal R&D funding for nuclear fusion. Earlier this month, Germany said it wants to build a “nuclear fusion ecosystem” made up of industry, startups and science so that a fusion power plant in the country becomes a reality as quickly as possible with a target of having a reactor in operation by 2040 – potentially making it among the first in Europe.",
            "“There is still room for improvement by broadening the range of government funded research topics,” Wendler said. “The German nuclear industry is prepared for this.”",
            "The cautiously bullish mood is helped by public opinion. Despite sometimes being against domestic large-scale nuclear, it always has been in favour of German owned or Germany-based companies developing and exporting nuclear technology, Wendler said.",
            "Germany closed its last nuclear power plants in April 2023​ as part of the Energiewende (energy transition) policy, which aims to shift the country towards renewable energy sources. Berlin had the second largest nuclear fleet in Europe.",
            "Neckarwestheim-2 was among the three nuclear plants to be finally shuttered on 15 April 2023."

            "Company seeing more longer-term contracting with parties seeking ‘reliable and sustainable’ partners",
            "The global climate crisis, the West’s renewed energy security needs in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the advancement of new nuclear technologies have been three main drivers behind “an increased momentum” to the enrichment market over the last 18 months, according to Sarah Forman, head of global strategy and corporate development at Urenco, a global enrichment services provider.",
            "Forman told an event organised by the European Nuclear Society and the Euratom Supply Agency (ESA) in Brussels that a “renewed emphasis” on supply security has led to more “longer-term contracting with parties that are seen as reliable and sustainable”. In the past, Russian state-owned enterprises had been offering enrichment at prices that “were simply unsustainable in a Western context”, she said.",
            "In 2023, Urenco signed contracts in Ukraine and Bulgaria to provide enrichment services as part of the fuel manufacturing process for the Russia-designed reactor fleets of the two countries as part of efforts to support these countries to diversify their fuel supplies. ",
            "“And we’re expecting that to continue as countries are looking to increase energy security and independence and are relying more heavily on Western suppliers like ourselves,” Forman said.",
            "Forman said Urenco has been able to optimise how it uses its assets to generate more separative work from the same machines and in the future can re-optimise again to make up for a lack of conversion capacity in the fuel cycle to meet the upcoming requirements of the enrichment market.",
            "Urenco has also embarked on a significant capital investment programme to build more of the long and mid-term enrichment capacity across all of its sites that will be needed to support the industry in the medium and the long term, Forman said.",
            "Forman said: “We started engineering, design and other foundational work to be able to deliver whatever the market requires of us. We’ve begun an ambitious hiring programme and we have made new contracts with our centrifuge supplier.”",
            "In July, Urenco approved an investment to expand uranium enrichment capacity at its US site in New Mexico, known as UUSA – a move sparked largely by new commitments from US customers for non-Russian reactor fuel.",
            "The investment will allow an additional capacity of around 700 tonnes of SWU [separative work units] per year, a 15% increase at UUSA, with the first new cascades expected online in 2025 and the whole facility online in 2027.",
            "Forman said the company has the option on its license to expand its enrichment site in Almelo, the Netherlands, from last year’s 5.1 million SWU up to 6.2 million SWU in the future.",
            "According to Forman, Urenco is also supporting the evolution of the nuclear fuel cycle to supply the next generation of reactor technology, including advanced, micro, and small modular designs.",
            "In March, the company signed a contract to provide enriched uranium products for the US-based Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) and its project to manufacture tri-structural isotropic (Triso) fuel particles in a planned joint venture with Framatome.",
            "Forman said the enriched uranium will be in the form of high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), up to about 20%, or “low-enriched uranium plus”, which is about 5 to 10% enrichment level.",
            "Urenco is also planning a new facility to produce Haleu for the newest reactor designs, said Forman and added that efforts are focused on “developing a commercial scope of the new plant”, including questions around location and capacity and how it connects into existing infrastructure. ",
            "The 2022 annual report released by ESA last month found that 62% of enrichment services to EU utilities came from two EU-based companies, France’s Orano and Urenco, which is jointly owned by the British and Dutch Governments and two German utilities RWE and E.ON, and operates facilities in the Netherlands, Germany, the US, and the UK. The remaining services were provided by non-EU sources. Deliveries of separative work from Russia to EU utilities accounted for 30% of total deliveries.",
            "In the US, Biden administration officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about the country’s reliance on Russia-procured enrichment services which is claimed to have posed a “critical threat” to national security and % climate goals.",
            "At the Cop28 climate conference in Dubai this week, leaders from the US, Canada, France, Japan and the UK – a group of G7 nations informally known as the Sapporo 5 – announced plans to mobilise $4.2bn (€3.9bn) in government-led investments to develop a secure, reliable global nuclear energy supply chain.",
            "The investments will increase uranium enrichment and conversion capacity over the next three years and establish a resilient global uranium supply market free from Russian influence.",

These devices include items such as syringes, catheters, IV sets, surgical gloves, and gauze that used in a wide range of health care applications. A patient in surgery or receiving wound care or simply having a blood sample taken, is highly likely to be treated using products that have been sterilised using cobalt-60 in a process called irradiation. Other important uses of cobalt-60 include the non-invasive treatment of cancers and brain tumours, polymer processing, food treatment and environmental applications.",
            "Cobalt-60 production and supply",
            "Cobalt-60 is produced in a small number of reactors located in Argentina, Canada, China, India and Russia. The largest producers are Bruce Power and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) that operate CANDU type reactors in Canada. CANDU reactors are well suited for cobalt-60 production with the technology and processes established in the early 1970s with a history dating back to the 1950s.",
            "CANDU reactors operate with stainless steel adjusters that shape the neutron flux for reactor operations. For cobalt-60 production, these stainless steel adjusters are replaced with adjusters containing bundles of metallic cobalt-59 slugs encapsulated into zirconium alloy capsules. The cobalt-59 adjusters are designed to replicate the neutron absorption characteristics of the stainless adjusters that they replace, so reactor operation is not impacted. While in the reactor core, the cobalt-59 atom absorbs one neutron to become cobalt-60 and over time the ratio of cobalt-60 to cobalt-59 increases. To achieve the required level of cobalt-60, the adjusters are activated over a period of 18-36 months.",
            "Above: A set of adjusters in the Secondary Irradiated Fuel Bay in preparation to separate individual cobalt-60 bundles (Photo credit: Bruce Power/ Canadian Nuclear Isotope Council)",
            "After this activation period, the adjusters are removed from the reactor during a routine maintenance outage. They are then transferred to a large pool at the reactor site where the adjusters are disassembled and the individual cobalt bundles are removed. These cobalt bundles are then shipped off site for processing and production of the finished product that is used for irradiation sterilisation.",
            "The design of the finished product, sealed radiation sources, must comply with international standards and be licenced by national regulators, and their manufacture must be to the highest quality standards. Only a very few specialist companies have the necessary infrastructure to meet these requirements and supply to the global irradiation sterilisation industry. All of the cobalt-60 from the Bruce Power and OPG reactors, currently making up around 50% of global supply, is manufactured into sources by Nordion (Canada) Inc., the world’s largest supplier to the irradiation industry worldwide.",
            "Above: Cobalt-60 sealed sources located inside a rack within the storage pool of an irradiation sterilisation facility (Photo credit: Nordion (Canada) Inc.)",
            "The supply of cobalt-60 from Russia, which represents about 25% of global supply, is also mostly through Nordion although some volume is supplied direct to the irradiation industry by JSC Isotope, an enterprise of Rosatom. Despite the challenges to continued supply from Russia in light of the current geopolitical situation, governments around the world appreciate the importance of cobalt-60 to global healthcare and have worked hard to ensure supply from Russia remains uninterrupted.",
            "Most cobalt-60 produced in China and India and some from Argentina is used to supply regional markets. This is partly due to a desire to support local operators but also a result of licensing restrictions and transportation constraints.",
            "Cobalt-60 supply and demand status",
            "Irradiation technology is applied globally by a network of approximately three hundred irradiators using cobalt-60. Approximately 80% of this cobalt-60 usage is for the sterilisation of medical devices. In the US alone, it is estimated that some 16 billion devices are sterilised annually using cobalt-60.",
            "The demand for sterilisation and, therefore, cobalt-60 is growing at rates not previously seen due to an increasing and ageing population, greater access to health care and the development of new devices that require sterilisation. Some sectors are experiencing double digit annual growth rates and in recent years, vaccine supply pressure concentrated the need for sterilisation and, in some cases, created a backlog.",
            "Although cobalt-60 supply continues to increase, in recent years this growth has been out-paced by growth in demand. This is of concern to the healthcare sector that relies on irradiation sterilisation to enable it to meet growing patient treatment needs. Whilst alternatives to cobalt-60 technology are available for sterilisation, these alternatives do not have the capacity to meet existing demand or the infrastructure to enable rapid growth to meet future demand.",
            "At a time of increasing sterilisation demand, there have been a few disruptions to cobalt-60 production. This includes the temporary shutdown for refurbishment of some existing cobalt-60 production reactors in Canada and Argentina, and periods of reduced supply from Russia. Reactor refurbishment is critical to extending the life of reactors by 25-30 years and but also creates opportunities to increase cobalt-60 production for the long term.",
            "Above: Co-60 is widely used in the sterilisation of medical instruments",
            "Reactor refurbishment and conversion for cobalt-60 production",
            "In the case of the ongoing Bruce Power Life Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project, the opportunity has been taken to add more cobalt-59 adjusters to increase cobalt-60 production above the existing levels. This investment will secure the operation of these reactors and cobalt-60 production until 2064.",
            "At the OPG Darlington refurbishment, the opportunity will also be taken to convert these four reactors to enable cobalt-60 production. This will add valuable cobalt-60 supply and builds on OPG’s experience of cobalt-60 production at Pickering.",
            "The Pickering reactors have been scheduled to cease commercial operation at the end of 2024, however, the Ontario Government recently confirmed its support of OPG’s plan to refurbish the Pickering B reactors that are also cobalt-60 producing units. This refurbishment is subject to approval by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) that is already considering a request from OPG to extend the operating licence of the Pickering B reactors until 2026. If approved, the reactors will continue operation until shut down to begin the refurbishment programme. Refurbishment would enable continued operation of these reactors for a further 30 years.",
            "The CANDU reactor at Embalse, Argentina, has also been refurbished recently to enable continued operation and cobalt-60 production for a further 30 years. Additionally, Russian cobalt-60 production has been expanded. While two of the cobalt-60 producing units at the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant have been shut down, five reactors at Kursk and Smolensk have been added. There is also a reported intension to increase cobalt-60 production at Indian PHWR reactors; and Nuclearelectrica Romania has announced a study of cobalt-60 production at its CANDU reactors at Cernavoda NPP.",
            "Currently, almost all of the world’s cobalt-60 is produced in CANDU Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and RBMK Light Water Graphite-moderated Reactors (LWGRs) of which there is a limited number. The greatest opportunity to significantly increase the availability of cobalt-60 is therefore to develop production in new reactor types. There are approximately 440 commercial reactors in operation of which more than 300 are Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs). This has made PWRs the reactor platform of focus for future cobalt-60 production.",
            "In February 2020, Nordion announced that it was partnering with Westinghouse to develop large-scale production of cobalt-60 in PWRs. Both Nordion and Westinghouse have since updated the irradiation market with the timeline of this important initiative and confirmation that progress has been made with technology development, licencing, manufacture of components and the recruitment of three utility companies that operate five reactors. Production of cobalt-60 in PWR’s would be highly scalable with the capacity to at least double existing worldwide production volumes from PWRs in the US alone.",
            "Other initiatives include the announcement in December 2021 that Framatome and Exelon Generation will cooperate to understand and develop solutions to produce cobalt-60 in PWRs operated by Exelon Generation (now Constellation).",
            "Securing the critical supply of cobalt-60",
            "The healthcare industry has relied on cobalt-60 since the 1960s when the demand for medical device sterilisation started to grow. The production of cobalt-60 in nuclear reactors remains critical to health care and will continue to be critical for the long term future. Although significant steps are underway to increase production, growing demand for healthcare means that new cobalt-60 supply will always be important.",
            "The road to engaging in cobalt-60 production is complex. There are a number of design and engineering considerations, safety assessments, the need to understand the impact on reactor efficiency and operations, and many other regulatory and operational considerations. However, there is also a wealth of experience and willing partners who understand the importance of increasing cobalt-60 production. In addition to the provision of clean energy, the production of cobalt-60 in support of health care remains a highly positive contribution by the nuclear industry to societal wellbeing.",

The HALEU pilot line, which is currently under construction, will prove the viability of Framatome’s technology for metallisation to support the development of the advanced reactor market.",
            "The USA’s current commercial nuclear fuel cycle is based on low-enriched uranium enriched to less than 5%. HALEU, enriched to between 5% and 20% is required by many of the advanced reactor technologies that are currently under development. As yet no US domestic commercial source of HALEU available although Centrus is developing a HALEU production facility supported by the Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "DOE is pursuing various pathways to produce HALEU through its HALEU Availability Program (HAP), authorised by the Energy Act of 2020. The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in 2022 included $700m to support HALEU development. Framatome has applied for DOE funding under the HAP Deconversion and Metallisation Request for Proposals. Successful completion and operation of the HALEU pilot plant will support Framatome’s efforts to expand the US fuel supply chain capabilities.",
            "Metallisation of HALEU is a crucial part of the HALEU fuel cycle. After enrichment, HALEU uranium hexafluoride must be “deconverted” to a form suitable for fuel fabrication. These include oxides, metal and alloys, nitrides and carbides. While this is traditionally done in fuel fabrication facilities, deconversion of HALEU enriched to more than 10% has to take place in a physical security Category II facility.",

It is also one more way that TerraPower is delivering on its promise to do our part to support the fuel manufacturing sector.”",

The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for its Natrium reactor demonstration project.",

        "text": [
            "Bulgaria’s Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has announced its decision to terminate the contract with Russia for the supply of nuclear fuel, according to plant executive director Valentin Nikolov. The contract was due to end in 2025. He added that Russian fuel already delivered will now serve as a reserve.",
            "He made the comments during a ceremony marking the loading of the last of the initial 43 cassettes containing nuclear fuel from US-based Westinghouse at Kozloduy NPP’s unit 5. The unit, which was closed for scheduled maintenance, is due to resume operations on 9 June. Nikolov emphasised that the price of American fuel is comparable to the Russian fuel. Simultaneously, negotiations are underway with the French company Framatome for the supply of nuclear fuel for Kozloduy unit 6. The last loading of unit 6 with Russian fuel will take place in the autumn. In October-November 2025, the reactor will operate in part with French fuel, which is a prototype of the current Russian TVSA.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6), which provide about 34% of Bulgaria’s electricity Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades. Kozloduy 5&6 were due to be decommissioned in 2027 and 2029 but have undergone refurbishment and life extension programmes to enable extension of operation from 30 to 60 years. Unit 5 was connected to the grid in 1987 and unit 6 in 1991.",
            "In April, Bulgaria’s Nuclear Regulatory Agency (AYaR – Agentsiyata za Yadreno Regulirane) licensed the use of the Westinghouse fuel for unit 5, the first 43 cartridges of which had already been delivered to the site. A 10-year contract with Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB for fuel supply for unit 5 was signed at the end of 2022. The new American fuel arrived at Kozloduy NPP by ship from Sweden.",
            "The permit is for a step-by-step transition to the new Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assembly RWFA fuel from the Russian TVEL fuel which is currently used. An earlier permit was issued in January for storage of the fuel at the site. The process of partial refuelling and parallel operation of both fuels will continue for four years. Only a quarter of fresh nuclear fuel will be replaced during the coming four fuel campaigns.",
            "“Today we are present at a historic moment… since, in the 50-year history of the Kozloduy NPP, the plant will operate with an alternative fuel for the first time,” commented Vladimir Malinov, Acting Minister of Energy at the ceremony.",
            "Kenneth Merten, the Ambassador of the United States in Bulgaria said: “Nuclear fuel diversification in Bulgaria is a first step towards diversification. The step was taken by several governments. I congratulate you on your vision. I believe that Bulgaria will become an energy hub after diversifying its fuel sources.”",
            "Caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev said this was the first stage of a real diversification of the nuclear fuel process. “This it is truly the beginning of the separation of Bulgaria from the almost complete dependence on Russia…. And without politicising, I will say that it is always good to have a choice. Diversification provides us with exactly that – a choice that gives better opportunities with 100% safety and security.” He noted that the first discussions with Westinghouse took place 2009-2010.",
            "“Kozloduy NPP celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2024 and it is a pleasure for us to contribute to the diversification of nuclear fuel supplies for this valuable customer of ours with this first charge”, said Tariq Choho, President of the Nuclear Fuel Department at Westinghouse."

            "Framatome has been awarded a multi-million-dollar contract to rehabilitate buried condenser feed pipes at an unnamed three-unit operating US NPP. Framatome will mitigate more than a mile of large diameter piping running underground to plant condenser boxes using its innovative spray-in-place structural pipe liner solution. The project will be undertaken during nine outages over eight years, with the first application planned or autumn 2025.",
            "Ageing and degradation of buried piping is an industry challenge and their location makes repairs and inspections expensive. Buried pipes and underground components for NPP operations range from just a few inches to more than 10 feet in diameter. Framatome says its spray-in-place liner offers the nuclear industry a safe solution that rehabilitates pipe internals and overcomes cost, safety and outage duration issues.",
            "Working with leading industry partners, Framatome developed an engineered structural spray-in-place liner system to rehabilitate safety-related piping beyond its original 50-year design life and through to the end of plant life. The fast-curing liner, which is delivered remotely using in-pipe robotic crawlers, is sprayed evenly onto the inside of the pipe, becoming the new pipe pressure boundary. The quick-installing system does not require excavation, minimising safety risks, reducing outage durations, and costs. The system has been validated during a two-year testing programme which was completed in 2023.",
            "“Framatome’s teams innovated to adapt an industrial solution and apply it to the nuclear industry in support of our customer’s long-term operational needs and competitiveness,” said Catherine Cornand, senior executive vice president for the Installed Base BU at Framatome. “Now utility customers have access to an innovative, technically advanced, turnkey rehabilitation solution that includes in-depth engineering, manufacturing, application, project management, technical support and OEM experience.”"

            "During his recent visit to France, Chinese President Xi Jinping advocated increased cooperation in a number of areas, including “nuclear energy, innovation and finance”. French President Emmanuel Macron said France was “ready to step up cooperation with China” in areas including “nuclear energy for civilian use”. The visit coincided with the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France.",
            "Among the business cooperation agreements concluded during the visit was a Letter of Intent (LOI) on Deepening Related Cooperation in the Nuclear Energy Field signed by China General Nuclear (CGN) Chairman Yang Changli and EDF Chairman & CEO Luc Raymond. Under the LOI, “the two parties will further expand and strengthen cooperation in aspects such as nuclear power engineering construction, talent training, EPR operations and leadership training in the field of nuclear power operations to achieve common development”, CGN noted.",
            "This visit took place during the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and France presenting an important opportunity to build on past achievements and guide the future of bilateral ties, Xinhua noted. Co-operation between CGN and EDF began in the 1980s with the construction of the Daya Bay NPP in Shenzhen, Guangdong province. Herve Machenaud, former technical director of EDF from 1984 to 1989 told Xinhua News Agency: “EDF put its trust in China, and China put its trust in EDF, a contract of trust that has kept the parties together for 40 years,” he said.",
            "The Daya Bay NPP began commercial operation in 1995. EDF and CGN then launched another project nearby, the Ling Ao NPP, which began commercial operations in 2002. Then in 2008, the two partners set up a joint venture to construct and operate two nuclear reactors based on European Pressurised Reactor technology in Taishan, Guangdong.",
            "CGN said that deepening and expanding cooperation areas “is of great significance to the development of civil nuclear energy in both countries and the business development of the two groups”. Two-way trade between China and France reached $78.9bn in 2023. China is now France’s largest trading partner in Asia, while France ranks as China’s third-largest trading partner within the European Union (EU).",
            "Also, during the visit, China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and EDF jointly released a “Bluebook” – a prospective study on nuclear energy to support low carbon transformation. CNNC Chairman Yu Jianfeng said: “China and France, as major nuclear energy-producing countries in the world, play an irreplaceable role in promoting nuclear energy to address climate change and low-carbon.”",
            "CNNC told Global Times that the cooperation between the CNNC and the EDF opens a new chapter in the two countries’ nuclear energy cooperation. EDF has developed and deepened its partnership with the CNNC over a long period. The two sides regularly hold high-level meetings, and cooperation covers multiple areas such as nuclear power research and development, construction, operation and maintenance, and fuel. The two companies participated in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) nuclear safety standards development work, especially the Nuclear Harmonisation and Standardisation Initiative (NHSI) small modular reactor regulatory forum activities. The EDF and the CNNC have also made important contributions to the standardisation work of international standardisation organisations and the International Electrotechnical Commission.",
            "According to Global Times, in the more than 40 years of nuclear energy technology cooperation, CNNC and the French Atomic Energy Commission have established seven collaborative laboratories in areas such as reactor thermal hydraulics, severe accident management, ageing and life management of pressurised water reactors, fast reactors, nuclear fusion, geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste, decommissioning, and radioactive waste management. The two sides also signed and implemented over 500 special cooperation projects.",
            "CNNC has also formed a consortium with Framatome to successfully bid for and implement the main machine installation project of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), and have good cooperation with the Orano Group in areas such as the research on uranium resources. In September 2019, the China-France TAC-1 Consortium led by the CNNC signed an installation contract with the ITER for core equipment of the tokamak. In February 2024, the ITER Organisation signed a new the vacuum chamber module assembly contract with the consortium.",
            "Global Times reported that the “Bluebook” is the first strategic planning soft science cooperation between Chinese state-owned nuclear energy enterprises and partners in developed Western countries in recent. It was included in plans agreed during French President Macron’s visit to China in 2023, according to Luo Qingping, President of CNNC’s China Institute of Nuclear Industry Strategy.",
            "The release of the Bluebook at the historical moment of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France can also be seen as the opening of a new chapter in the nuclear energy cooperation of the two countries. In the future, China and France can combine the contents of the “bluebook” to deepen cooperation in promoting nuclear energy development, including cooperation in exploring third-party markets.",
            "The Bluebook describes the current status of nuclear energy development and good practices in China and France. It proposes three initiatives:",
            "China and France jointly advocate that every country in the world has the right to develop nuclear power, but safety must be the top priority in the development process;",
            "Nuclear energy can effectively support low-carbon development. Future nuclear energy technologies such as small modular reactors and nuclear fusion are important solutions to the global energy problem.",
            "Urgent action is needed to address the crisis caused by climate change. Energy transformation is imperative, and the development of nuclear power is undoubtedly an effective approach.",
            "China and France will continue to deepen cooperation in multiple areas such as nuclear engineering, nuclear power operation, and nuclear fuel cycle. They will promote the synergy between nuclear energy and renewable energy, formulate public policies focusing on low-carbon growth, accelerate the development of renewable energy such as hydropower, wind power, solar power, and geothermal energy, extend the lifespan of existing NPPs, initiate new nuclear power construction projects, and optimise the cost of energy transition.",
            "They will cooperate to promote advanced nuclear energy technologies such as small modular reactors and fusion reactors. They will work together to advance the commercial deployment of small modular reactors. They will also strengthen international cooperation in the field of nuclear fusion research, Global Times noted, citing CNNC.",
            "At the same time, they will promote the comprehensive application of nuclear energy; popularise technologies such as nuclear heating, seawater desalination, and hydrogen production; diversify forms of nuclear energy utilisation, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They will also conduct research on the impact of climate change using nuclear technology to address issues such as water scarcity, soil erosion, land degradation, and increased diseases and pests in plants and animals caused by climate change."

EDF is proposing its EPR1200 reactor, KHNP is proposing its APR1000.",
            "EDF, KHNP and Westinghouse, submitted binding bids in October for a fifth unit at the Dukovany NPP and non-binding offers for up to three more units – a sixth at Dukovany and two at the Temelín NPP. However, in February the Czech government changed the tender to be binding offers for four new units, excluding Westinghouse, which was proposing its AP1000 reactor, because it \"did not meet the necessary conditions\". Prime Minister Petr Fiala noted that contracting for four units could have a 25% benefit in terms of costs compared with individual bids.",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002.",
            "Tomáš Pleskač, member of the Board of Directors and Director of ČEZ’ New Energy Division said EDU II “will now evaluate the bids and, in accordance with the contract with the state, we will submit the evaluation report to the Ministry of Industry and Trade and subsequently to the Government of the Czech Republic for final approval.” The bids were submitted electronically by means of special encryption and a uniquely secure storage.",
            "It is expected that the contracts will be finalised during this year and ready for signing by 31 March 2025. “The final signing of the contracts will be followed by a thorough preparation of design and planning documentation so as to meet the deadline for the start of the test operation of the new unit in 2036.”",
            "In parallel with the tender procedure, EDU II has been working on other parts of the project. After the Ministry of the Environment issued a positive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2019, EDU II received a Siting Permit from the State Office for Nuclear Safety and a Generating Plant Authorization from the Ministry of Industry and Trade in 2021. A non-final zoning decision was issued on 30 October 2023.",
            "EDF said its Updated Initial Bid Supplement covers the supply of engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning activities for up to four EPR1200 reactors at the Dukovany site (units 5&6), and at the Temelín site (units 3&4). The offer also covers the design and implementation activities for nuclear fuel and delivery of fuel assemblies for this programme.",

Since 2016, KHNP has identified over 200 potential Czech suppliers and signed more than 50 Memoranda of Understanding as a basis for future cooperation. In addition, KHNP is the only bidder counting on a Czech company for the delivery of the turbine, which is one of the most important and largest components in the nuclear power plant. The South Korean company is thus trying to maximize the share of Czech suppliers in the project, as requested by the Czech side.”",

During the covid pandemic, KHNP also donated masks and other hygiene supplies to schools, nursing homes and town halls in the region.”",
            "Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) announced it had approved, under EU state-aid rules, the Czech government's support of the construction of the new nuclear. The EC, which began its investigation in June 2022, said that the proposals had been modified to take account of concerns during the process. The Commission \"concluded that the aid is appropriate to achieve the objectives pursued, as well as proportionate as it is limited to the minimum necessary, while the competition distortions caused by the measure are minimised”. The beneficiary of the measure is EDU II.",
            "Czechia plans to grant direct price support in the form of a power purchasing contract with a State-owned Special Purpose Vehicle. The contract will ensure stable revenues for the nuclear power plant for a period of 40 years. The beneficiary will also benefit of a subsidised state loan to cover a majority of the construction costs and a protection mechanism against unforeseen events or policy changes that may make the realisation of the project impossible.",
            "EC Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said the Commission’s role is to ensure that the state aid proposed is targeted, proportionate and does not unduly affect the EU energy market. “During our investigation Czechia has modified the initial measure and submitted substantial commitments. This has allowed us to approve the aid.”",
            "The commitments entail certain restrictions. The EC said that to \"ensure that the aid is proportionate and does not unduly distort the functioning of the electricity market\" Czechia had \"introduced a remuneration formula akin to a two-way contract-for-difference, which provides revenue stability and limits excess remuneration through a yearly ex-post settlement\". This effectively means that if electricity prices are below the agreed level, the nuclear project will receive a subsidy to make it up to the agreed price, and if electricity prices are above the agreed price, the nuclear project would pay money back to the government.",
            "The added that the period of direct price support had been cut from 60 years to 40 years and the strike price was being set \"on the basis of a discounted cash flow model ensuring that the total aid amount, taking into account the subsidised loan, is limited to the funding gap of the project … EDU II's shareholders will get a rate of return equal to the market return that investors would require on a similar investment\".",
            "There will also be a clawback mechanism lasting for the operational lifetime of the plant to ensure \"additional gains generated by the project will be shared with the Czech state\" and \"to avoid market concentration and remove the risk that the measure provides an advantage to certain electricity consumers, Czechia has committed to ensure that at least 70% of the power output will be sold on the open power exchange – namely, day-ahead, intraday and futures markets – over the entire lifetime of the power plant. The rest of output can be sold on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory terms by way of auctions\".",

            "Idaho National Laboratory (INL) originates from the National Reactor Testing Station, which was established in 1949 to provide a location to develop, test, and demonstrate civilian reactor systems and support the nuclear navy. The site is well known for its first reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I), which started operations in December 1951. EBR-I was the first nuclear reactor to produce usable amounts of electricity. The reactor was also novel in that it used a liquid metal coolant and operated using a fast neutron spectrum that enabled demonstration of nuclear fuel breeding, a key concept for maximizing uranium resource use. Over the ensuing decades, 52 reactors were operated on the site establishing the technical and scientific basis that underpins the safe operation of our current commercial reactors as well as for the development of future advanced reactor concepts. Four of those 52 reactors are still operating.",

However, 15 years ago, energy companies managed to increase the installed capacity of each of them to 500 MWe through upgrades and the use of reserves. A similar process took place in Temelín, where the power of both units increased from 981 MWe to the current 1,086 MWe.",

The new assemblies are designed to make the use of uranium in the fuel more efficient.",
            "TVEL (part of Rosatom) has long been the fuel supplier for both Temelin and Dukovany but from 2024 US-based Westinghouse and the French Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel, which is now being tested at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP. Currently Dukovany has TVEL fuel for several years.",
            "It remains to be seen how fuel from other suppliers will affect plant efficiency. Havlin commented earlier: \"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know.\"",
            "Nuclear power currently supplies 34% of the Czech Republic’s electricity. It plans to build up to four new units and is also considering small modular reactors.",

        "title": "Nuclear authorities seek justification for use of Newcleo reactor in the UK",
        "text": [
            "UK nuclear trade association, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) has applied for a justification decision for newcleo’s lead-cooled fast reactor design, the LFR-AS-200. The application makes the case that the benefits of clean, firm, flexible power from the LFR-AS-200 would far outweigh any potential risks. NIA says these are” rigorously controlled by robust safety features, including passive safety systems, built into the design and incorporated into the operating arrangements, in line with the UK’s regulatory requirements”.",
            "The application also argues that the reactor design would support nuclear energy’s contribution to a stable and well-balanced electricity grid, which is essential to reduce consumer bills and maintain economic competitiveness.",
            "Justification is a regulatory process which requires a government decision before any new class or type of practice involving ionising radiation can be introduced in the UK. A justification decision is one of the required steps for the operation of a new nuclear technology in the UK, but it is not a permit or licence that allows a specific project to go ahead. It is a generic decision based on a high-level evaluation of the potential benefits and detriments of the proposed new nuclear practice as a pre-cursor to future regulatory processes.",
            "This is the first ever application for justification of an advanced nuclear technology in the UK. The government has confirmed that the application has been accepted for consideration, and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) will support the Secretary of State in their role as the justifying authority responsible for the justification decision.",
            "NIA CEO Tom Greatrex said advanced reactors such as newcleo’s design “have enormous potential to support the UK’s energy security and net zero transition, so we were delighted to apply for this decision”. He added: “This is an opportunity for the UK Government to demonstrate that it backs advanced nuclear technologies to support a robust clean power mix and to reinvigorate the UK’s proud tradition of nuclear innovation. We look forward to engaging with the Government and the public throughout this process and to further applications for new nuclear designs in the future.”",
            "Stefano Buono, newcleo CEO said this was “an important milestone in our development programme and a vital step forward in our delivery plan for the UK”. He added: “We continue to progress our UK plans at pace – aiming to deliver our first of a kind commercial reactor in the UK by 2033. We are but one player in the new nuclear renaissance and we look forward to working with government and the rest of the sector to develop the robust supply chain that can deliver the UK’s ambition of 24GW of nuclear power by 2050.”",
            "The Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004 require that any new practice that produces ionising radiation is justified by an evaluation of the potential benefits and the potential detriments. Defra will now conduct a process of internal review and consultation with a number of statutory consultees. NIA previously applied for justification decisions for the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) designed by Hitachi, the Advanced Passive 1000 (AP1000) reactor designed by Westinghouse and the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) designed by AREVA (now Framatome).",
            "Our objective is to quickly deliver a versatile solution at a competitive cost. This is why we are designing two Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), enabling plant manufacturing and reducing costs: they are 30MWe and 200MWe, a relatively small power compared to conventional nuclear power plants (1000MWe average). The 30MWe can swiftly meet the commercial demand for small electric generating units, such as for islands, remote communities, or to power large vessels (shipping propulsion). The 200MWe can be an economically competitive solution for central station power plants.",
            "The newcleo website now includes a mock-up of its reactor design and some additional technical information. Newcleo says it relies o more than 20 years’ experience on lead technology, based on an agreement with Italy’s ENEA. “Our agreement with them includes a newcleo team of engineers, who will work permanently for about 10 years at ENEA Brasimone Centre,” the website notes.",
            "Newcleo says it “works in partnership with top level research institutions, including ENEA, Politecnico di Milano, Politecnico di Torino” and is also “signing MOU agreements with international industry players” It adds: “We are holding constructive conversations with high-ranking government representatives in the UK and France to explore the best options and locations to develop our project”.",
            "The first step of its delivery roadmap will be “the design and construction of the first-of-a-kind 30 MWe lead-cooled fast reactor to be deployed in France by 2030, followed by a 200 MWe commercial unit in the UK by 2033”. The timeline it lays out is:",
            "2026 – Our non-nuclear electrically-heated prototype will allow us to test our solutions for the well-known challenges related to liquid metal and in particular lead, to be built at the ENEA-Brasimone site, Italy.",
            "2030 – the S-30 Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR), a 30 MWe test reactor and demonstrator, to be built in France, will enable progressive licensing of our technical innovations.",
            "2032 – the first AS-200 LFR commercial unit (First Of A Kind – FOAK) will be deployed in the UK, a terrestrial waste-to-energy reactor exploiting the capacity of LFR reactors to close the fuel cycle, and produce energy.",
            "2032 – will also see the TL-30 Lead-cooled Fast Reactor, a mini reactor, producing 30 MWe and requiring infrequent refuelling (more than 10 years) and maintenance: a nuclear battery that can be easily replaced at end of life. It can also be used for maritime applications.",
            "Long-term – All the previous steps and designs serve a further goal: to design and commercialise the Accelerator Driven System (ADS), a concept proposed by Nobel laureate Carlo Rubbia. This consists of a subcritical (not self-sustained) LFR coupled with a particle accelerator, enabling a thorium-based fuel cycle and the ultimate conditions for complete safety.",
            "At the same time, Newcleo says it will directly invest in a mixed uranium/plutonium oxide (mox) plant to fuel its reactors. In June 2022, Newcleo announced it had contracted France's Orano for feasibility studies on the establishment of a mox production plant. Its mid-term strategy is to establish mox fuel manufacturing in developed countries.",
            "Newcleo says since its launch in 2021 it is “actively pursuing a targeted acquisition strategy that will incorporate key companies with strong capabilities in nuclear engineering, manufacturing and waste management. Newcleo “intends to expand existing skills and services, supporting its development programme with investments” and says “acquired businesses will become integral to newcleo’s plans, developing and delivering crucial services for our projects’ deployment.",
            "The website mentions in particular Italy’s SRS Servizi Ricerche e Sviluppo (SRS), technology company Fucina Italia, shipbuilding company Fincantieri, and inspection and certification company RINA as well as the pump and engineering Rütschi Group. However, these are only a few of the very long list of acquisitions and agreements undertaken since the company was established.",
            "SRS is a chemical petrochemical engineering company with nuclear fuel cycle experience “having already been involved in 24 LFR projects, becoming the world leader in reactor lead cooling technology”. According to the SRS website, these projects include France’s Superphénix reactor; the European fast reactor (EFR) project; the European sodium-cooled fast reactor – smart (ESFR-SMART), France’s ASTRID; the European Lead Fast Reactor under the ELSY (European Lead SYstem) project; the EU’s Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) conceptual design; and the Generation IV International Forum’s LFR.",
            "However, Superphénix which operated from 1986-1996 was closed in face of protests and technical problems. Plans to construct Astrid were cancelled in 2019. Moreover, both these projects were sodium-cooled not lead cooled fast reactors. The other projects mentioned were simply conceptual designs.",
            "Newcleo says its mission “is to generate safe, clean, economic and practically inexhaustible energy for the world, through a radically innovative combination of existing, accessible technologies”. It claims to “capitalise on 30 years of R&D activity in metal-cooled fast reactors and liquid-lead cooling systems. Newcleo says its reactor design “has been optimised over the last 20 years leading to the concept of an ultra-compact and transportable 200 MWe module with improvements in energy density compared to other technologies”.",
            "Currently, however, the only operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029. As yet, despite its rapidly growing list of acquisitions and co-operation agreements and optimistic timeline, newcleo’s technology remains in the very early conceptual design stage.",

After it was signed in February, Bulgaria’s Parliamentary Energy Commission said South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C), part of Hyundai Corporation, will be invited to submit a binding offer with a price for the design, construction, supply, installation and commissioning of units 7&8. Of the five candidates interested in building the new nuclear facilities, two Chinese and two American companies did not meet the requirements, he said. Bulgaria plans to launch unit 7 by 2034 and unit 8 in two to three years later. The estimated cost of construction is some $14bn, although some experts have said it could increase to $30bn.",

            "That have potential to enhance the safety in case of a severe accident in a reactor core for a longer time than the current UO2-zirconium alloy fuel system",
            "That can maintain or improve fuel performance during normal operation and operational transients",
            "That are compatible with all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle (transport, storage, and possible use within a closed fuel cycle)",
            "ATFs mostly involve new cladding and fuel pellet designs that increase the performance and severe accident response times of nuclear fuel. They take advantage of new materials that reduce hydrogen build-up, improve fission production retention, and are structurally more resistant to radiation, corrosion, and higher temperatures. In addition, they are expected to last longer than current fuel designs and may extend the time between refuellings from 1.5 to 2 years for pressurised water reactors. This would reduce the amount of fuel assemblies needed, leading to less waste production and a reduction in fuel costs.",
            "Those technologies that are mature enough to start fuel qualification and achieve near-term deployment – within the coming decade in the existing fleet of light water reactors (LWRs) and in the LWR-based small modular reactor (SMR) designs – are termed “evolutionary accident tolerant fuels (eATFs)”. There are numerous designs and concepts that could be termed as eATFs, based on features such as enhanced cladding, modified uranium oxide fuel (including dopants), and increased enrichment.",
            "A great deal of research and development has been undertaken to support the introduction of eATFs into commercial nuclear power reactors, with the first eATFs entering service in 2021 as part of a number of test programmes. These tests support the economic and safety cases for reactor core operations and provide preliminary information to anticipate potential impacts on the back end of the fuel cycle when compared with traditional power reactor fuels. This includes during storage, transportation, reprocessing and recycling, and disposal.",
            "Nuclear fuel has been subject to continuous development over the past 40 years and has reached a stage where it can be safely and reliably irradiated up to 65 GWd/tU in commercial nuclear reactors. During this time, there have been many improvements to the original designs and materials, but the basic design of uranium oxide (UO2) fuel pellets clad with zirconium (Zr) alloy tubing has remained the fuel of choice for the vast majority of commercial nuclear power plants. However, severe accidents, such as those at the Three Mile Island plant in 1979 in the US and at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP in 2011 showed that, under extreme conditions, nuclear fuel will fail. Under certain circumstances, high temperature reactions between zirconium alloys and water will lead to the generation of hydrogen, with the potential for explosions to occur.",
            "During the earthquake and tsunami that seriously damaged the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, the reactors shut down immediately but fission products in the fuel continued to release decay heat. Zirconium alloys in the cladding of the fuel assemblies oxidise rapidly at temperatures a few hundred degrees higher than normal operating temperatures, leading to disintegration of the fuel rods and rapid corrosion of the cladding. This process released hydrogen causing explosions that further damaged the plant.",
            "This disaster prompted researchers to begin developing accident-tolerant fuel solutions which would allow more time before active cooling is required in a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or, even better, would be able to indefinitely withstand the sustained high temperatures created by decay heat and insufficient cooling, thus preventing or delaying the release of radionuclides during an accident.",
            "Research, focused mainly on the design of fuel pellets and cladding, as well as interactions between the two, almost immediately got under way in key nuclear countries such as the USA, Russia, France the UK, South Korea, Japan and China. This research has been supported by international bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).",
            "The IAEA has been supporting international co-operation among member states in fuel development since the 1980s, long before the Fukushima accident. This included efforts to enhance the capacities of computer codes used for predicting fuel behaviour, within the framework of Coordinated Research Projects (CRPs). However, the Fukushima accident demonstrated the need for adequate analysis of all aspects of fuel performance to prevent a failure and to predict fuel behaviour in accidents, as well as the need to test and model the behaviours of ATFs.",
            "The IAEA works through technical meetings, consultancy meetings, conferences, and CRP activity. Two CRPs were organised in the wake of Fukushima to focus on the modelling and testing of nuclear fuels and ATFs in design basis and severe accidents.",
            "The first CRP on “FUel Modelling in Accident Conditions (FUMAC)” (2014-2018) sought to better understand fuel behaviour in accident conditions by identifying best practices in the application of relevant physical models and computer codes, used by different member states, and the enhancement of their predictive capacities. Well checked results of accident simulation experiments and their analyses with advanced fuel performance codes were carried out in the CRP and the results published in an IAEA technical document in 2019.",
            "The second CRP on “Analysis of Options and Experimental Examination of Fuels with Increased Accident Tolerance (ACTOF)” (2015-2019) dealt with the acquisition of data through experiments on advanced technology fuel types and cladding materials. It also looked at development of modelling capacity to predict the behaviour of the components and the integral performance of ATF designs under normal and transient conditions and sought to demonstrate improvements under severe accident conditions. These results were published in an IAEA technical document in 2020.",
            "Based on recommendation of an IAEA Technical Meeting (TM) on Modelling of Fuel Behaviour in Design Basis Accidents and Design Extension Conditions in May 2019, a new CRP on Testing and Simulations of ATF was launched in 2021 and is ongoing. It includes a set of experiments with some participants providing samples to several laboratories. The experiments then provide data on a new set of ATFs. The results will be available in 2024.",
            "This CRP aims to address factors affecting the design, fabrication and in-pile behaviour of currently operating and innovative nuclear fuels and materials for power reactors, and to increase technology readiness. Objectives include:",
            "To perform experimental tests including single rod and bundle tests on ATFs’ performance under normal, Design Basis (DB) and Design Extension (DE) conditions",
            "To benchmark fuel codes against new test data either obtained during the CRP or from existing data relevant to advanced fuel and cladding concepts from member states’ experimental programmes",
            "To develop LOCA evaluation methodology for ATF performance with a view to NPP applications",
            "To look at part of the methodology for using ATF fuel in NPPs and to develop an open source library on the subject of ATF",
            "Dr Nicolas Waeckel a former employee of Electricité de France (EDF) who worked for many years on ATF development told NEI: “We started to work on ATF together with US DOE right after Fukushima, participating in expert groups in IAEA and OECD.” He added: “I was in charge of developing a new safety standard to qualify this new type of fuel. When you develop a new type of fuel you cannot apply current standards. You have to develop new criteria, a new way of validating the material… and maybe even changing the way of thinking about safety for a type of fuel which can be very different from current fuel.”",
            "Since 2012, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has supported the development of ATF concepts through its Enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (EATF) programme. DOE is currently funding research by France’s Framatome as well as GE Hitachi and Westinghouse. Russia is also currently testing its TVS-2M ATF at unit 2 of the Rostov nuclear plant.",
            "Waeckel pointed out that the DOE had received funding from Congress to develop safer fuel “so all the fuel manufacturers and the researchers worked quite hard on development”. As a result, even before Fukushima, many laboratories and manufacturers “had on their shelves in the closet some exotic fuel under development, but on standby,” he said. “However, there was no demand, no real need to put this fuel in a reactor because the current fuel was behaving quite well.”",
            "He added: “People who developed the nuclear industry 15 years ago were pretty good, and they learned a lot from their mistakes and some bad experiences so that now we have achieved very good optimisation.” That, argues Waeckel, is why the fuel concept did not change. “And now, all of a sudden, because of Fukushima, just because DOE had the great idea of saving the world, we are considering change. I think we have to be a bit more humble.”",
            "He said the driver to develop ATF used to be enhanced performance and behaviour in accidents, “but we realised that this is not really achievable in the short term”. So now the focus is on other things – cladding, fuel cycle optimisation – a longer cycle and higher burn up. “This may be of some interest to the operators… improving plant economics – that is the motor,” said Waeckel.",
            "Among the multiple variants of ATF proposed by the various fuel suppliers (see Figure 1), there are two main categories of fuel, with respect to their technology readiness level, which relates to the time and effort needed to develop, qualify, and license the concepts. These are:",
            "Short-term evolutionary concepts, for example coated Zr-based claddings; stainless steel cladding (eg FeCrAl); high density fuel (eg U3Si2), and doped fuel pellets (eg Cr doped)",
            "Longer-term revolutionary concepts, such as refractory claddings (eg lined Mo), silicon carbide (SiC) claddings; microcells fuel; micro-encapsulated fuel pellet concepts; uranium nitride fuel",
            "Key requirements for advanced fuels relate to in-reactor fuel performance, cladding performance, and compatibility with all system constraints.",
            "Waeckel stressed that developing a new type of fuel is a long-term objective in terms of its qualification. “Putting new fuel in a reactor is not like putting a new app on your telephone. If the app doesn’t work you just dump it and the phone is still safe. But if you put the wrong fuel in a reactor it could be a nightmare for everyone. So, we have to be very prudent, very careful, think about everything that could happen. No operator in the world wants to experience bad surprises.”",
            "However, this caution is not necessarily a negative thing. “For me, all this is very positive because it is motivating all the labs, all the researchers, and especially the young generation,” he said. “They see a vision for the future in developing this new type of fuel.” Some projects are very exotic and totally different from standard fuel while others are very similar – just fuel with a novel coating. Some of these evolutionary fuels are already under irradiation as part of the testing and qualification process.",
            "However, Waeckel cautioned the ultimate progress for these evolutionary fuels is limited. “What we are talking about is grace time – we are going to gain a couple of minutes. It is not a game changer. It is a small change and offers some benefit. Is it real accident tolerant fuel? Not really, but it is an improvement,” he said.",
            "Concluding, Waeckel said: “My main message is that development is always positive for the nuclear community because we are making progress in all areas – in research, in investigation techniques, in measurement techniques, in modelling, and all these improvements are beneficial for the nuclear industry as a whole,” he said, observing: “So even if the product itself is not going to be a magic answer or a magic solution, it is a platform for the young generation to think about safety, modelling, advanced modelling, advanced investigation.”",

            "Unit 2 of France’s Cruas-Meysse NPP is now operating its first full core of recycled uranium fuel. EDF Nuclear & Thermal Park Director Cedric Lewandowski said this was “a historic step for the relaunch of the uranium reprocessing sector”.",
            "Reprocessed uranium (RepU) is derived from used reactor fuels after they are reprocessed at Orano’s la Hague facility. In France, only the four reactors at the Cruas-Meysse NPP in Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes are certified to use RepU. “Long-term work has been carried out over the past 10 years to revive a reprocessed uranium sector, suspended in 2013 (and which resumed in 2018) explained Lewandowski on LinkedIn.",
            "Treating used fuel to extract material with recoverable energy potential (96% of the mass composition of the used fuel), namely uranium, for use a second time (mono-recycling) is a circular economy approach that will save 25% of natural resources in the coming decades, he noted. “In addition, this sector emits 30% less CO2 emissions than the natural uranium sector and reduces the impact on the environment.”",
            "France aims to gradually ramp up production over the next few years and EDF's objective is to reuse the RepU in 1300 MWe plants from 2027. In the 2030s, reprocessed uranium will represent more than 30% of the uranium loaded each year into France’s reactors.",
            "Historically, the enrichment process, requiring centrifuges solely dedicated to RepU, was only undertaken by Rosatom at the Siberian Chemical Combine. However, the new geopolitical situation since Russia’s special military is leading to a revaluation of these contracts.",
            "Even before that, in 2018, Framatome signed a contract to design, fabricate and supply fuel assemblies using RepU to EDF between 2023 and 2032. The fuel assemblies were to be produced at Framatome's facility at Romans-sur-Isère. EDF had studied the possibility of recycling reprocessed uranium in pressurised water reactors in the early 1980s. The first enriched reprocessed uranium manufacturing campaign took place at Romans in 1987. Precursor fuel assemblies were loaded into Cruas unit 4 from 1987 to 1990 and a first enriched reprocessed uranium fuel reload was introduced in 1994. EDF used RepU between 1994 and 2013 in the four Cruas reactors, recycling 4,000 tonnes of RepU.",
            "EDF is storing reprocessed uranium for up to 250 years as a strategic reserve. Currently, reprocessing of 1,100 tonnes of EDF used fuel a year produces 11 tonnes of plutonium (immediately recycled as mixed-oxide fuel) and 1,045 tonnes of reprocessed uranium converted into stable oxide form for storage. Orano says there are some 34,000 tonnes of RepU in interim storage on the Tricastin site.",

Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners. In October 2020, the US Department of Energy (DOE), through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Programme (ARDP), awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate the Natrium technology.",
            "Earlier in February TerraPower selected five suppliers including Framatome, to support the Natrium Reactor Demonstration Project in Kemmerer, Wyoming. TerraPower said, when completed, the Natrium plant will be a full commercial operating. The other four suppliers are GERB Vibration Control Systems, Thermal Engineering International, Hayward Tyler and Teledyne Brown Engineering.",
            "The customized equipment to be supplied by Framatome consists of two separate rail-mounted machines used to perform refuelling and related core component transfer activities. Automated and remote functionality enhances the safety and performance of the refuelling operations during scheduled outages and maintenance.",
            "Tara Neider, senior vice president and project director for the Natrium Reactor Demonstration Project said this equipment project is an important milestone for advancing the Natrium reactor design. “The breadth of Framatome’s expertise and depth of its operating experience provides certainty and strengthens our diverse supply chain needed to bring this unique technology to market.”",

        "text": [
            "Rosatom scientists have completed a key stage of reactor tests on laboratory fuel samples for a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR). Russia views HTGRs as important to future plans for the production of hydrogen. An engineering nuclear power station (AETS -Atomnoi EnregoTekhnologicheskoi Stantsii) based on HTGRs is being developed by nuclear utility Rosenergoatom (part of Rosatom) as part of an investment project to create domestic technologies for the large-scale production and consumption of hydrogen and hydrogen-containing products.",
            "Reactor tests of laboratory samples of HTGR fuel, which started in early 2022, were conducted in parallel at the experimental facilities of two key research centres – at the SM-3 reactor on the site of the Scientific Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad (Ulyanovsk region) and at the IVV-2M research reactor of the Institute of Reactor Materials (Sverdlovsk branch of the NN Dollezhal Research & Development Institute of Power Engineering – NIKIET)",
            "By the end of 2023, in the IVV-2M reactor, one of the batches of laboratory samples developed and manufactured by the AA Bochvar Research Institute of Inorganic Materials (VNIINM – part of Rosatom fuel company TVEL) and fuel components developed and manufactured by JSC Luch (scientific division of Rosatom), achieved a burnout of 11-12% of heavy atoms. This effectively corresponded to the design values of burnout for HTGR fuel. During the entire long irradiation cycle of the laboratory samples, the temperature conditions of fuel were maintained in the range of 1000-1200° C, which met the requirements for HTGR fuel from the main designer of the reactor unit, OKBM Africantov (part of Rosatom’s engineering division).",
            "The first one was a Soviet-­designed experimental reactor ABTU‑15 and a pilot plant ABTU-ts‑50 with a VGR‑50 reactor. It was designed for power generation and radiation-­induced modification of materials (polyethylene, wood, and others). In the 1970s, a pilot high-temperature gas-cooled reactor VG‑400 was developed to generate electricity and high heat energy. This was followed by the development of modular HTGRs, such as the VGM‑200 pebble-bed reactor and MVGR-GT power unit with a closed-­cycle gas turbine. That was the time when Soviet engineers developed the conceptual design of a VTGR‑10 small power reactor and principles of combining nuclear and hydrogen technologies, which implied the use of hydrogen produced with nuclear power as a source of energy for industry, transport and households.",
            "As to the AETS, it has a long history. In the 1980s, the Soviet government adopted a national hydrogen economy programme that provided for the development of HTGRs for energy and industrial processes. For example, the VG‑400 reactor design was modified for the production of ammonia fertilisers. It was planned to build five plants with HTGRs but the plans were disrupted by the Soviet collapse. However, the idea to build a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor persisted to evolve into the development of a 600 MW reactor with a direct gas turbine cycle, which was underway from 1998 to 2012. General Atomics (US), Framatome (France) and Fuji Electric (Japan) participated in its development.",
            "Today, development of an advanced AETS with a high-temperature helium-cooled reactor and a hydrogen plant has reached the front end engineering design phase, and site selection is underway. The principal difference of the current design compared with the earlier ones is that a hydrogen production plant is an integral part of the nuclear station. The final product of the station will be not heat but hydrogen, which can be stored, transported and sold to customers.",
            "Rosatom said engineers had to make several tough choices. For example, they decided not to use any foreign technology and to use exclusively Russian technology. For this reason, a carbon-free steam methane reforming (SMR) process was chosen instead of electrolysis as a preferred hydrogen production method. The SMR process has long been mastered in Russia, which also has plenty of both methane and water.",
            "Another choice was whether to use an intermediate circuit for transferring heat to the hydrogen plant. It was decided for safety reasons to physically separate the hydrogen-producing and reactor circuits with an intermediate helium circuit. One of the next questions was how far apart the reactor and hydrogen-producing circuits should be to ensure that no accident at the hydrogen plant could damage the reactor.",
            "It is assumed that the HTGR will have a thermal capacity of 200 MW. The hydrogen plant will be capable of producing 110,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year. Since the AETS will have four HTGRs and, accordingly, four hydrogen plants, the station’s total capacity will be 800 MW of thermal energy and 440,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year.",
            "The temperature of the helium will be 330° С at the reactor inlet and 850° С at the outlet. Fuel elements are being designed to meet inherent safety requirements: the reactor must be capable of shutting down without triggering shutdown systems, and residual heat removal from the shut-down reactor needs no external energy source or staff involvement. Another requirement is to make the reactor more powerful given the existing reactor vessel fabrication capabilities. As a result, the developers chose to use block-type fuel assemblies as fuel.",
            "The project is expected to be brought to the investment stage in 2024 as the technical design of the reactor unit, declaration of intent and other documents will be prepared by then. The design and licensing stages of the project are scheduled to be completed in 2028, followed by construction of the first unit, which is expected to be completed in 2032. The remaining units are planned to be built in 2035.",

            "In 2022 contracts were with Westinghouse and Framatome for the VVER-1000 units at Temelin. In 2022 ČEZ also decided to increase its fuel reserves stored at the NPPs to improve energy security. Bohdan Zronek, Director of the Nuclear Energy Division for ČEZ, said that the company was currently completing the expansion of storage space at Dukovany, with the aim of keeping at least three years’ supply.",
            "In 2019, six Westinghouse test fuel assemblies were inserted into the Temelín 1 reactor core to verify their properties and the results are now being evaluated by experts from both Westinghouse and ČEZ.",
            "Westinghouse fuel was previously used at Temelín from 2002 to 2009 but following technical problems including fuel deformation and incomplete rod insertion, TVEL was selected as fuel supplier. TVEL in 2006 won a tender for a 10-year fuel supply contract with delivery to start in 2009. The plan was to phase in the TVEL fuel gradually but in 2009 ČEZ decided to immediately switch to TVEL fuel in 2010 and the remaining Westinghouse fuel was removed. Westinghouse subsequently redesigned its VVER-1000 fuel following similar problems in Ukraine.",
            "However, Westinghouse has only recently designed fuel for VVER-440 reactors, which is now being tested at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP. ČEZ said, for Dukovany, Westinghouse will use fuel based on the Rivne design.",
            "Tarik Choho, President of Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel noted: “We have already supplied over 1,500 fuel assemblies for VVER-1000 reactors, which have already been verified by operation without problems and as expected. We plan to bring the latest version to Dukovany, based on fuel assemblies designed for VVER-440 reactors, which are already used at the Rivne NPP in Ukraine. And we believe it will be just as successful.”",
            "ČEZ noted that both existing (TVEL) and new types of fuel (Framatome and Westinghouse) meet the requirements for switching to longer fuel campaigns. These will be 16 months in Dukovany and 18 months in Temelín. As a result, ČEZ expects to achieve an average annual production of 32 TWh by 2030.",

President Raeisi launched the \"Iran-Hormoz\" project through a video call, as part of his administration's trip to the province while Eslami and other officials attended the ceremony at the plant's location in Sirik city.",
            "The 5,000 MWe plant, estimated at $15bn, is part of broader plans to develop the Makran coastal region, Eslami noted. It is part of a long-term target to construct 20,000 MWe of nuclear capacity and to develop Iran’s nuclear industry in the next two decades.The Iran-Hormoz Plant is designed to have four 1,250 MWe units.",
            "“By the year 2041, we should reach the generation capacity of 20,000 MWe nuclear electricity in the country, and the realisation of this goal has been taken into consideration in the Makran coast of Hormozgan Province,” Eslami said. “It is hoped that it will be completed as planned and coordinated and based on scheduled timing.”",
            "He added: “To date we have delivered the suitable land for the construction of the plants in Hormozgan province, and its detailed studies have begun and are progressing. On this site, an industrial town must be created so that we can implement and pursue projects of such magnitude according to the set timeline.” He noted that this should include infrastructure facilities and specialised training capacities for human resources during construction and operation of the plant.",

In addition, it is constructing an indigenously designed NPP at Dharkovin on the Karun river. In his address, President Raeisi said: “We have no doubt that what started in Bushehr, Hormozgan and other areas will be quickly followed.”",
            "Bushehr unit 1, built by Rosatom, began in 2011 and reached full capacity the following year. Rosatom subsidiary ASE, which is the general contractor for the Bushehr project, and Nuclear Power Production and Development Company of Iran signed an EPC turnkey contract for construction of two more VVER-1000 reactors – Bushehr 2&3 – in 2014 and preliminary work began at the site in December 2016. In March 2017, construction officially began of the two units and pouring of first concrete for Bushehr 2 took place in November 2019. The units were planned to be commissioned in 2024 and 2026 but faced delays due to Covid-19 and financial difficulties.",
            "Eslami said in October 2023 that construction work at the two Bushehr reactors had increased ten-fold compared with previous years. “Those involved in the project have been working round the clock in three shifts.\" He added that hoped first concrete would soon be poured for the third unit. \"We hope that the second unit will be completed and inaugurated in less than five years and the third unit 1.5 years after that,\" he said.",

AEOI said in December 2022 that construction of a 300 MWe domestically designed pressurised water reactor (PWR) had begun. The Darkhovin NPP will be built about 70 kilometres from the southwestern city of Ahvaz in the provincial capital of Khuzestan. Eslami said construction is expected to take eight years at an estimated cost of $1bn. In March 2023, Eslami explained that this was just the first stage of a 2,000MWe plant.",
            "\"Our enemies tried to break our will using sanctions and refused to cooperate in the construction of an NPP for many years,\" he stated, noting that sanctions began in 1979. However, AEOI developed the project by relying on domestic capabilities. Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran had signed a $2bn contract with France’s Framatome to build two PWRs at Darkhovin. However, France subsequently withdrew from the project and completed components of the plant remained in France. Then in 1992 former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani agreed a plan with China, despite US objections, to buy two 300 MWe reactors for Darkhovin, but the Chinese also subsequently withdrew from the project under pressure from Washington. Iran also signed up Zurich-based ABB as a consultant, but the Swiss-Swedish company similarly withdrew several times before finally quitting in 2018 in face of US sanctions.",
            "Iranian officials said Tehran plans to become a hub for designing and building NPPs in the near future. They believe the ongoing global fuel crisis had made the use of nuclear energy more relevant. Eslami said all countries, including Iran, are entitled to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and that Iran intends to exercise that right.",

            "People often say that in their business, there is no room for error. When talking about the operations at Framatome’s Pump & Motor Service Center in Lynchburg, Virginia, USA, that phrase has never been more accurate.",
            "Framatome, an international leader in the nuclear energy market, prepares components for the motors used to power nuclear reactor cooling pumps. The pumps help move coolant around the primary circuit of a nuclear reactor for heat transfer and to prevent overheating of the core. And, while the motor service centre provides a range of repair services to the nuclear industry, it is the refurbishment and maintenance of coolant pump motor components that represents the lion’s share of the shop’s business. Framatome has refurbished in excess of 130 reactor coolant motors for the US nuclear fleet and countless more globally.",
            "The reactor coolant pump set is one of the most highly radioactive components in a nuclear plant. Since the motors which drive those pumps are also located in the same vicinity, they are also subject to radiological contamination. When these pieces come into Framatome for service, workers put them through a rigorous surface cleaning process that removes all contamination and prepares the components for the next step, which is often a Service Level 1 coating.",
            "The surface cleaning process typically uses sandblasting or abrasive blasting with a high-pressure stream of air containing abrasive material. Once the process is complete, radiological protection tests are performed to ensure the part is within federal safety guidelines. After blasting the cleaned surface of the component also offers a strong profile necessary to ensure solid adhesion of the new Service Level 1 coating (some washing, degreasing, and even heating processes may be involved as well).",
            "Pump motors require perfection",
            "Given the potential consequences of a coolant pump motor failure Framatome re-evaluated its cleaning room operations and determined that a first-class blast room, essential to the process, was needed.",
            "The existing room was actually a 14-year-old blast booth that had served its purpose admirably, but had reached the end of its service life. “Previously, our shop technicians moved motor sub-components by overhead crane to our truck bay where we then forklifted the motor into the blast room,” explained Jamie Campbell, General Manager of Framatome’s Pump and Motor Services. “We also had to thoroughly clean our existing blast booth anytime we were loading motors at our shop. The existing booth took up some of our loading area so special precautions were needed to ensure the safety of the tractor trailers that utilised the shared location. This proved to be a time- consuming and costly process,” added Campbell.",
            "He noted that multiple people would be involved in the process as a result: “One person ran the forklift, and multiple spotters were stationed nearby to make sure everything went smoothly, while watching over the safety of the person inside the booth. Safety is first and foremost at Framatome, and the components we manage are as large as 10 to 12 feet [up to 3.7 metres) in diameter – some weighing over 25,000 pounds [20 tonnes]. The additional resource oversight is critical.”",
            "Ultimately, Framatome wanted crane access into the blast room so that the process could be simplified, and the forklift could be eliminated, while increasing the safety of the entire operation. To that end, Framatome purchased a blast room from Titan Abrasive Systems.",
            "The new blast room required stringent specifications due to its interaction with radioactive material. Plus, there were numerous space issues that needed to be resolved prior to installation of the 15’ square and 15’ high room (4.6m3). This included modifying low-hanging ductwork and other constraints. The space issues were resolved by strategically relocating the blast room in an area served by the existing overhead crane, while keeping the dust collection equipment in the original area.",
            "In addition, because the room was located next to a truck bay, a special frame was built to handle the exhaust equipment, allowing trucks to get in and out. “This was an exceptional design/build due to the space constraints and hazardous aspects of the materials,” noted Brandon Acker, president of Titan Abrasive Systems. “We worked closely with Framatome to ensure that the new blast room met all their requirements.” Titan added a custom HEPA filter to the outlet of the dust collector, elevated 12 feet (3.7 metres) above the floor to avoid stirring up potentially contaminated dust from the floor. Accompanying the HEPA filter was a Photohelic® gauge, used to measure differential pressures of air; a light tower and an alarm that will activate in the event of an emergency condition.",
            "Framatome noted benefits of the new blast room almost immediately. “We no longer need to involve the spotters and logistics people,” Campbell said. “Our blasting operation is now basically a one-man job. I would say the manpower effort has been reduced by as much as 50%.”",
            "Tony Wood, Pump & Motors Operations Manager at Framatome, explained the motivation behind the new blast room project: “Refurbishing motors for nuclear reactors are critical to our industry, and every piece of equipment used in the process has to perform exactly as planned. That includes the blast room, which plays such an integral part in the overall operation. From every perspective – safety, functionality, and quality of the finished product – the new blast room has been up to the task.”",
            "Campbell added: “It’s a sound capital investment. The payback on it is probably about five years or less if you look at the decreased labour costs and overall reduced effort. But the enhanced safety and improved performance are what truly makes this a good business investment. It all adds up to a safer, more efficient, and pleasant blasting operation.”",

        "text": [
            "UK-based nuclear technology company newcleo has announced a strategic and industrial partnership with France's NAAREA designed \"to support all players in their industrial, technological, scientific and regulatory development\" of Generation IV fast neutron reactors.",
            "According to newcleo, the initiative is designed to meet the specific needs of the Gen-IV reactors currently under development. “The aim is to support all players in their industrial, technological, scientific and regulatory development. It is part of a complementary approach to the essential industrial SMR alliance, soon to be launched by the European Commission”. NAAREA (Nuclear Abundant Affordable Resourceful Energy for All) and newcleo, the first two winners of the France 2030 call for projects for innovative nuclear reactors, are joining forces to accelerate the development of their technologies.",
            "Newcleo is developing a lead-cooled fast neutron mini-reactor (30MWe then 200MWe) and says its reactor design “has been optimised over the last 20 years leading to the concept of an ultra-compact and transportable 200 MWe module with improvements in energy density compared to other technologies”.",
            "NAAREA, founded in 2020 by Jean-Luc Alexandre and Ivan Gavriloff, is developing the XAMR molten salt fast neutron micro-generator (40MWe or 80MWt). NAAREA benefits from the support of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), as well as industry players such as Assystem, Dassault Systèmes, Orano and Framatome.",
            "Whilst different technologies, both intend to make use of used fuel from conventional reactors, ensuring complete closure of the fuel cycle. Both plan to bring their solutions to market by 2030. The partnership is intended to be open to all players involved in the industrial design and deployment of Gen-IV fast neutron reactors, in the following cooperation areas:",
            "The fuel cycle: access to used nuclear fuel (in particular the separation of transuranic elements (plutonium and americium)), and the development and implementation of a supply chain for reprocessing used fuel;",
            "Financing fuel cycle infrastructure: through the development of public-private partnerships;",
            "Research: the development of a joint research and development platform (heat exchangers, materials, etc.) and the facilitation of funding at European level;",
            "Industrial development: by optimising and supporting procedures with the safety and security authorities, providing access to scientific computing tools particularly for safety demonstrations, making test centre sites available for future prototypes (including associated laboratories), and developing and implementing shared test facilities.",
            "This will enable newcleo and NAAREA, and subsequently other players, to pool their efforts to accelerate innovation in the field of Gen-IVnuclear energy, and also gain in efficiency, while retaining their two technologies and their specific features. Under this partnership, joint initiatives can be developed with the entire French nuclear ecosystem to facilitate the decision-making needed to successfully complete the energy transition through a mix that includes sustainable and innovative nuclear energy.",
            "Stefano Buono, newcleo Chairman and CEO said the collaboration “reinforces our shared commitment to innovation and sustainability in the nuclear sector”. NAAREA Chairman & founder Jean-Luc Alexandre said, through the partnership, the companies “are creating momentum to accelerate their development by providing a joint and coordinated response to the demands of public authorities for a unified voice to express common needs” He added: “Our two companies want to simplify the work of public authorities and ultimately promote the development and deployment of Gen-IV nuclear power in Europe, against a backdrop of strong global competition.”",
            "This comes just a few days after newcleo has signed an agreement with Italy-based MAIRE subsidiaries NextChem Tech and Tecnimont to apply its reactors to decarbonise the chemical industry, including hydrogen production. This was just the latest in a long line of agreements and acquisitions undertaken since its establishment in 2021.",
            "Newcleo claims to “capitalise on 30 years of R&D activity in metal-cooled fast reactors and liquid-lead cooling systems. NAAREA says its XAMR “is a fast neutron reactor that offers the advantage of producing electricity and heat from nuclear spent fuel”. While both companies make extravagant claims for their technologies on their websites, neither has so far produced even a basic design of their planned reactors.",
            "Currently, the only operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029. Given the lack of detailed designs, it seems very unlikely that either newcleo or NAAREA will be able to meet its target of deploying a liquid-metal cooled fast reactor in France by 2030.",
            "While research on fast reactors took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, things began to change in the late 1970s as concerns about scarce uranium resources waned and public opinion became increasingly hostile in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the USA and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. By the early 1990s the US, the UK and Germany had closed down their programmes. France continued with its Phenix and SuperPhenix projects for a few more years, finally closing SuperPhenix in 1998 and Phenix in 2009, Subsequently, in 2019, France also cancelled the Generation IV ASTRID sodium-cooled fast reactor demonstrator design project. Interest is now reviving in Europe and the USA both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, but it remains at the design phase."

            "National Atomic Company Kazatomprom has announced that the Kazakhstan-China joint venture, Ulba-TVS LLP, which produces fuel for Chinese NPPs has completed the qualification process for the production of AFA 3G type A fuel assemblies. Technology holder France’s Framatome has confirmed the announcement. Work on the certification began in March 2023 and took place in four stages, Kazatomprom noted.",
            "Kazatomprom published an image on its website of the document signed by Framatome Senior Executive Vice President Lionel Gaiffe, dated 18 December 2023. The qualification allows the plant to produce AFA 3G type A fuel assemblies, in addition to AFA 3G AA fuel assemblies they already supply to China, thereby expanding the product line, the company added, noting that it plans to commission industrial production of AFA 3G type A fuel assemblies and supply a batch to China in 2024. Ulba Metallurgical Plant (UMZ) with 51% and CGNPC Uranium Resources Company Limited (CGNPC-URC – part of China General Nuclear Power Group – CGN) with 49%.",
            "The 200 tU Ulba-TVS plant began operations in November 2021 after receiving certification from Framatome. The plant also received recognition as a certified nuclear fuel supplier from end user CGNPC-URC.and delivered its first batch of fresh fuel to CGNPC-URC in December 2022 followed by a second in May 2023. The company has a guaranteed sales market for 20 years going forward.",
            "The joint venture, Ulba-TVS, was set up in 2015 by UMZ and CGNPC-URC. In 2016, construction of a nuclear fuel fabrication plant began as a joint project involving Kazatomprom, CGN and France’s Areva (now Framatome). The plant is managed by Ulba-TVS and procures enriched uranium either from China or Russia.",
            "Since 2006, Kazakhstan has been considering the pros and cons of constructing a nuclear plant, and in 2014, Kazakhstan and Russia signed a memorandum of understanding for constructing a reactor, but a location for the site was never finalised. Kazakhstan operated a small Soviet-built BN-350 fast reactor from 1973 to 1999 producing both power and desalinated water, which is now undergoing decommissioning.",
            "Kazakhstan is now seriously considering NPP construction. In August 2023, the Energy Ministry provided an update on previously conducted studies related to the choice of reactor technologies and siting for Kazakhstan’s first NPP. The Ministry said that, based on studies, Ulken village in the Zhambyl district of Almaty region had been chosen as the most preferred locality. The Ministry also recommended choosing a technology “proven by the experience of construction and successful operation of a similar plant”. The shortlist included:",

In December Kasakh media reported that the Chinese proposal offered a nuclear plant at half the price of French, Russian, and South Korean alternatives. However, concerns have arisen over the Chinese design that reportedly uses outdated technology, despite being compatible with Kazakh-produced fuel assemblies.",
            "The projected cost for a two-unit nuclear power plant is over $12 billion, with an output of 2.4 GWe. The Kursiv news outlet cited Baurzhan Ibrayev, chair of the Central Asia advisory board of the UK-based New Nuclear Watch Institute, as saying the projected cost of the Chinese-built plant would be up to half the price of proposals submitted by French, Russian and South Korean entities. At the same time, Ibrayev appeared to suggest that China had used “not the latest technology” in the Ulba-TVS project.",
            "One advantage of Beijing’s proposal is that a Chinese design would be compatible with Kazakh-produced fuel assemblies, Kursiv reported. The other designs under consideration, however, would not be able to run on domestically produced fuel assemblies, according Ibrayev. “Today, there is new technology, new reactors” requiring different fuel, he is quoted as saying. The Kazakh government has not officially commented on the Kursiv report.",

The submission of the report was one of the permit conditions imposed when the government granted Fortum's two Loviisa units until the end of 2050. Fortum was required to submit a report to the Ministry by the end of.2023 on how it will handle the procurement of fresh fuel in the future. The purpose of the permit condition is to ensure that the fuel supply for Loviisa would no longer rely solely on the Russia’s TVEL.",
            "Loviisa NPP comprises two Soviet designed VVER-440 units, which were commissioned in 1977 and 1980 and initially received fuel from Russia. In 1996-98 a fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In June 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies – four fixed and one follower assembly – in Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to the Loviisa NPP in Finland which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The NOVA E-3 and NOVCA designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006. However, in 2007 Loviisa decided to switch back to Russian fuel. After failing to extend the Loviisa fuel contract and failing to win any other VVER-440 delivery contracts, Westinghouse decided to withdraw from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and design development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "Loviisa’s current fuel agreement with the TVEL is valid until the end of the current operating licences of the plants two units in 2027 and 2030. In spring 2022, Fortum applied for a new operating licence for both units until 2050, and announced that a tendering process would be arranged for fuel supply for the next operating licence period.",
            "Fortum had announced in November 2022 that it had signed an agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company to deliver a new fuel type for Loviisa. However, the introduction of new fuel is a multi-year project that requires regulatory approvals. Efforts to develop new design VVER-440 fuel restarted in 2014 in face of the demand for increased security of energy supply in Europe. Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe, and was granted €2m ($16.5m) in 2015 to launch the ESSANUF programme, which ran until 2017. Development continued and in early 2023, Westinghouse and Enusa agreed to manufacture VVER-440 fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain. The following September the first test assemblies were loaded at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP.",
            "According to its report to the Ministry, Fortum will tender for fuel production after 2027/2030. Meanwhile the agreement with Westinghouse and the fresh TVEL fuel in stock will ensure Loviisa’s fuel supply. In addition, Fortum announced that it is investigating the possibilities of another Western fuel supplier developing VVER-440 fuel in order to improve the security of fuel supply and strengthen competition. Most likely this could be France’s Framatome, which recently signed a fuel supply agreement with Hungary, which also operates VVER-440s. The Ministry said it will continue to monitor the availability of fuels.",

            "Six small modular reactor (SMR) designs have been selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK – are those considered most able to deliver operating reactors by the mid-2030s and support the UK’s ambitions to reach 24 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Gwen Parry-Jones, CEO of Great British Nuclear, explained: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029.”",
            "The SMR competition is part of a plan for the UK to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy. A nuclear power revival is a central plank of that strategy and the companies through to the next stage will be invited to bid for government contracts later this year. The winning bidders are expected to be announced in spring next year and contracts are due to be awarded in the summer. Announcing the initial tranche of winning entrants, UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: “Small Modular Reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.”",
            "EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited are the companies that have been chosen for the next stage of the process. Key design details and developments are outlined below:",
            "EDF’s NUWARDTM is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor with an integrated primary loop producing 340 MWe from two independent reactors rated at 170 MWe each or 540 MWth. The two units will be housed in a single building and will share common equipment where possible.",
            "According to EDF, the design is focused on standardisation, modular manufacturing and simplicity for in-factory mass production, and flexibility in the construction and operation phases. Furthermore, the design has been developed to support load following and adapted for non-electric uses. With a design availability of around 90%, the fuel cycle is two years and the service life is 60 years. The core features 76 fuel assemblies.",
            "In March this year, EDF created the NUWARD subsidiary in line with its objective to achieve first nuclear concrete in 2030 for its reference SMR plant in France. After finalising the conceptual design, NUWARD is now shifting to the basic design phase.",
            "The NUWARD subsidiary will continue to work with historic partners CEA, TechnicAtome, Naval Group as well as new partners Framatome and Tractebel who were onboarded last year. Tractebel will be responsible for the civil engineering preliminary studies and the evaluation of costs, for example.",
            "Earlier this year EDF submitted the NUWARD design to France’s Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority), marking the start of the pre-licensing process while in June 2022, EDF announced that the design would be the case study for a European early joint regulatory review led by ASN with participation from Finland’s Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB).",
            "Renaud Crassous, NUWARD’s President said: “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the NUWARDTM SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030”.",
            "According to EDF’s SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years.",
            "GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR generating 870 MWth that is based on a larger BWR that is already licensed and operating. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is a Generation III+ reactor certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. The SMR version, the BWRX-300, uses natural circulation and passive cooling isolation condenser systems as well as fully passive safety systems. It’s fuel enrichment, averaging 3.81% and with a 4.95% maximum, puts it firmly in the realms of conventional commercially available fuels and it has a design refueling cycle of 12-24 months as well as a 60-year operational design life.",
            "The construction technologies incorporated into the design adopt advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques that have been proven in the oil and gas, tunneling and power industries. As a result of this approach and using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, GE Hitachi suggests the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in as little as 24-36 months while also achieving an approximate 90% volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW it should also account for around half the amount of concrete. As with other SMR designs, the BWRX-300 claims a cost-competitive approach that can be deployed for both electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating.",
            "An advanced reactor, GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 sets itself apart from other SMR designs with its proven, less complicated attributes and anticipates the design will be deployable globally as early as 2029 thanks to proven know-how and innovative construction techniques. Launched in 2017, the SMR is the 10th evolution of the BWR light water reactor design from GE.",
            "The design has achieved some notable success. This year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to explore the construction of multiple advanced nuclear reactors including proposals for a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site, starting with a plant design and an NRC license application with a view to potentially getting an operational SMR at the site around 2032. Meanwhile, last year Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) selected the BWRX-300 for single-unit project that was initially anticipated to begin operating as early as 2028.",
            "Holtec’s SMR-160+ small modular reactor is a PWR that uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The design, which has been in development since 2010, features a reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components that are located underground, as well as a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down or dissipate decay heat. A key part of the SMR-160 roll-out as envisioned by Holtec is to deploy the reactor as a replacement for the boilers found in coal-fired power stations and reusing the majority of the existing assets. The use of multi-stage compressors that are capable of uprating SMR-160’s steam (700 psi @ 595 Deg F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant are a critical part of this plan. Furthermore, the ability of the SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure also opens new development opportunities, such as using high-pressure steam for industrial applications.",
            "Having been shortlisted, the aim is to start construction of the first UK SMR-160 unit as early as 2028 and Holtec intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s in serial production by 2050 across the UK, amounting to 5.1 GW.",
            "This year South Korean national financial institutions K-Sure (Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) and Kexim (Export-Import Bank of Korea) signed agreements with Holtec and Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to provide financial support for SMR-160 projects around the world.",
            "Holtec has a collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C from late 2021 that will see Hyundai perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction. The reactor will be initially manufactured at Holtec’s Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus in Camden, New Jersey.",
            "The SMR-160 design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "More recently, Ukraine’s nuclear generating company Energoatom signed a cooperation agreement that envisions implementation of an SMR-160 pilot project with targeted grid connection by March 2029. The deal further contemplates up to 20 additional SMR-160 units in Ukraine and a manufacturing facility.",
            "The NuScale SMR is a PWR dubbed the NuScale Power Module. This a small PWR is designed to generate 77 MWe at 250 MWth and with be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGRTM SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. It will use standard light water reactor fuel and is the only small modular reactor to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As with other SMR designs, the NuScale Power Module was developed to supply electricity but also potentially generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications. The design features passive operating and safety systems and the modules are submerged in a pool built below ground level.",
            "NuScale SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries and the first project is expected to begin operation in 2029 in Idaho. NuScale has already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components and, in May, South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility began producing forgings for the first VOYGR-6 power plant to be built for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "Earlier this year Polish metals company KGHM Polska MiedzKGHM received preliminary state approval for a planned SMR which followed on from a 2022 agreement with NuScale to work on deploying a VOYGR plant in Poland by 2029.",
            "A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed this year by Romanian nuclear utility SNN, NuScale, Romanian companies E-INFRA and Nova Power & Gas, US-based Fluor Enterprises and South Korea’s Samsung C&T Corporation to collaborate on the deployment of VOYGR plants in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania aims to be the first country in Europe to deploy a VOYGR SMR and earlier this month Romania’s National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities approved the Licensing Basis Document for the NuScale design.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWth. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK where it has completed the first phase and is expected to complete the second step by July 2024.",
            "Commenting on the shortlisting, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce SMR CEO, said: “We have the only SMR technology in a European regulatory approval process, putting us almost two years ahead of any of our competitors. Securing a domestic contract is vitally important to unlock the enormous global export potential of our clean energy technology.”",
            "This year Rolls-Royce SMR and Sumitomo Corporation completed a joint feasibility study which shows the reactor could offer a significant advantage for the production of low-carbon hydrogen when cost, availability and carbon emissions are taken into consideration.",
            "The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finnish power company Fortum to explore opportunities for the deployment of SMRs in Finland and Sweden. Last year Fortum began a two-year feasibility study to explore necessary conditions for deployment of SMRs.",
            "A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs and expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s. Rolls-Royce is also discussing deployment of its SMR with the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and the Netherlands.",
            "The Westinghouse AP300TM small modular reactor is currently the only SMR based on a licensed, operating nuclear reactor design. Launched in May this year, the design is derived from the operating AP1000 PWR which makes it unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks. It is an advanced, Generation III+ single-loop pressurised light water reactor.",
            "It utilises the same engineering, components and supply chain as the AP1000 which Westinghouse says will thus enable streamlined licensing and leveraging of available technical skills. The company adds that the advantageous economics of the AP300 are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development. Four AP1000 units are operating in China with a further six under construction and one is operating at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, USA, while a second is nearing completion there. The simplified, modular, ultra-compact nuclear island also reduces construction costs and schedule, Westinghouse says. For these reasons the company argues that it is confident that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "The AP300 SMR features advanced passive safety systems designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown condition without operator action, back-up power or pumps and has an output of 300 MWe from 990 MWth.",
            "Commenting, Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO said: “We look forward to this opportunity to demonstrate that the AP300 SMR is the best option for the UK.”",
            "Earlier this year Westinghouse Electric Company and Finland’s Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the possibilities for the development and deployment of AP300 reactor projects in Finland and Sweden. This deal was followed by a similar MoU agreement with Slovak state-owned nuclear company JAVYS and another with Ukraine’s Energoatom.",
            "The successful development of SMRs could completely transform how nuclear power stations are built and result in billions of pounds of investment in the UK and elsewhere. The flexibility of design means that SMRs could also play a significant role is decarbonising hard-to-reach sectors like chemicals, building materials and other energy-intensive industries. Although six companies’ designs have been shortlisted for the next phase of the UK competition, much will depend on a successful roll out of the winning designs, not just in the UK but much further afield too. SMRs clearly offer much promise but the success of SMRs will also mark a key breakthrough for nuclear technology more broadly."

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded a contract to TRIGA International, a joint venture between Framatome and General Atomics, to fabricate fuel for the MARVEL microreactor at Idaho National Laboratory(INL). The TRIGA fuel fabrication contract was awarded through Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), which operates INL. Framatome will manufacture a fuel similar to the TRIGA fuel used in US university reactors.",
            "Framatome’s dedicated TRIGA manufacturing facility at CERCA Romans was selected to fabricate this fuel in line with the schedule of the MARVEL project. Framatome relaunched its dedicated TRIGA manufacturing facility at CERCA in response to the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy’s goal to maintain world-class research and development capabilities. After a seven-year $80m modernisation project, operations resumed at the end of 2022 for the first time since 2012. Framatome CERCA is the world’s only manufacturer and supplier of uranium-zirconium hydride fuel for use in TRIGA type research reactors.",
            "This award follows the restart of the TRIGA programme after nearly 10 years, and the first successful fabrication and delivery of TRIGA metallic fuel to Penn State University in September. “DOE and TRIGA International have reestablished the TRIGA fuel supply to support U.S. university research reactors,” said Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr Kathryn Huff. “With this contract, we will leverage that investment to support demonstration of advanced reactors as well.”",
            "MARVEL is a sodium-potassium-cooled microreactor that will generate roughly 85 kWt and serve as a test capability to speed the development of microreactor technology. MARVEL recently achieved 90% final design enabling the project to move forward with fabrication and construction. The 90% threshold allows for minor changes that might arise due to unforeseen complexities during construction and assembly. The project team is currently testing a full-scale, electrically heated replica of MARVEL that will help verify the performance of the microreactor’s cooling system.",
            "While the design won’t be considered 100% final until the microreactor is cleared for operation, this stage permits INL to award contracts and proceed with next steps. It also permits DOE to award contracts for reactor components and fuel fabrication. Under the DOE Microreactor Program, it will be built inside the Transient Reactor Test Facility at INL with future plans to connect it to a microgrid. The reactor will be used to help industry partners demonstrate microreactor applications, evaluate systems for remote monitoring, and potentially demonstrate control technologies for new reactors.",
            "Later this year, INL will work to purchase fuel for the microreactor, which will use a version of TRIGA fuel similar to that used in university research reactors across the US. Additional milestones beyond that include safety analysis, training, and drafting procedures, followed by the construction and assembly of the microreactor, and finally, fuel loading.",
            "TRIGA is a reactor designed by General Atomics that is used for research and hands-on training. TRIGA type fuel designs are now being explored for new applications beyond university training. The unique properties of TRIGA fuel can be seamlessly transitioned to non-TRIGA plants such as small modular, micro or advanced reactors. Framatome and General Atomics created the TRIGA International SAS joint venture in 1995 to market TRIGA fuel elements manufactured at CERCA Romans. More than 66 TRIGA units have been built around the world and approximately 38 reactors are still in operation.",

        "title": "Novel fuels set for growth",
        "text": [
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing. (Credit: 2427999 from Pixabay)",
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing as the recent energy crisis and climate change concerns are allowing nuclear generation to experience something of a renaissance. According to IAEA forecasts, by 2050 the global nuclear power plant fleet will more than double its current capacity: from almost 380 GW now to 873 GW. However, the Agency notes that the increase will be largely achieved through nuclear technologies that are now just being developed and tested, including those which involve the use of novel fuels.",
            "Today, about 30 companies from two dozen countries produce nuclear fuel for land-based reactors. The total volume of nuclear fuel production capacity is not so large – about 20,000 tonnes per year. The three largest producers – French company Framatome, US-based Westinghouse and Russia’s TVEL – supply approximately half of this total production volume.",
            "In recent years many of these producers have accelerated their activities in the field of development of novel fuels. At the same time, the current diversity of technical reactor concepts implies an equal diversity of fuel types. As part of these developments, particular attention is being paid to new accident tolerant fuels (ATF).",
            "The development of ATF has become a priority for fuel designers over the last decade, notably in response to an analysis of the causes of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant which included the zirconium-steam reaction that takes place at temperatures above 1200 °C. There are currently two key pathways to develop ATF technology: to reduce the amount of zirconium in the fuel assembly or to modify the chemical composition of the fuel so that the heat transfer rates of the fuel increases. While it cannot be said that the use of novel fuels will prevent all possible accidents the development of ATF is designed to provide more response time in the event of a rare emergency, as well as to obtain technological and economic advantages during normal operations of the nuclear reactor.",
            "The creation of novel fuel is currently being carried out by all the largest manufacturers as well as other significant players in Europe, the Americas and Asia.",
            "Changing cladding and composition",
            "At present the main ATF efforts of developers are aimed at creating new materials for both cladding and fuel composition. One of the more promising possible solutions is the development of cladding coatings that include chromium in one form or another. Chromium coatings on zirconium alloys provide increased corrosion and wear resistance, as well as reduced hydrogen permeability, which helps maintain the ductility of zirconium alloys. Another option that requires further study, but is potentially interesting for the production of cladding, is composite materials based on silicon carbide.",
            "A universally preferred coating technology has not yet been identified; various manufacturers use different options that they find most suitable. According to Fedor Vysikailo, a professor at the Department of Theoretical Physics at Moscow State University, complex application methods have a high technological, but low economic efficiency.",
            "The methods of heavily doping the surface have the same problem. More promising, according to Vysikailo, are laser application methods. Scientists also note the attractiveness of magnetron methods for coating fuel rods (high application speed and uniformity of coating).",
            "For fuel compositions, options are also being considered that include the addition of chromium or molybdenum, as well as the use of silicides or uranium nitride instead of uranium oxide. New fuel compositions also include doped uranium dioxide (UO2), high-density fuels (eg, U3Si2), and metallic fuels, such as uranium-molybdenum.",
            "Like Westinghouse, Framatome is focused on developing composite-clad fuels. In the long term, the company plans to develop a SiC/SiC composite cladding and Cr2O3-doped uranium dioxide fuel. Currently, Framatome is preparing to manufacture a novel molybdenum-uranium (U-Mo) fuel to extend the life and safe operation of the Forschungsreaktor München II (FRM II) research reactor in Germany and has recently received approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to apply the company’s suite of Advanced Codes and Methods to operating conditions with uranium 235 enrichments above the industry standard of 5%.",
            "The activity of American developers in the area of novel fuels could be partly explained by the aging of the local nuclear fleet – approximately half of the existing units will reach the end of their design life before the mid-2030s and with them the status of the US as one of the world’s largest nuclear fuel importers.",
            "Much of the activity the surrounds novel nuclear fuels is focused of high enrichment low assay uranium (HALEU) which can reach enrichments of up to 20% U235. For example, Centrus is notably beginning first-of-a-kind HALEU production at its American Centrifuge Plant cascade located on the Department of Energy’s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) reservation in Piketon, Ohio. According to Dan Leistikow, VP of corporate communications at Centrus, that will be the first new US-owned and US-based technology enrichment plant to start production in 70 years. Centrus’ demonstration project will only deliver an initial 20 kilograms of HALEU before the end of the year, but the company has plans to scale up to 900 kg of annual production starting in 2024.",
            "According to analysts, that will create certain conditions for the beginning of mass production of HALEU in the US, but only in due course.",
            "At the same time another US-based generating company, Southern Nuclear, has announced that it has also received permission from the US NRC to use advanced nuclear fuel enriched with uranium 235 to 6% at the newly commissioned Vogtle nuclear power plant. This is the first time a US commercial reactor has been approved to use fuel enriched above 5%.",
            "Particular hopes are also being raised by the novel nuclear fuel which is being produced by the American-based Lightbridge Corporation. This fuel is reportedly rapidly gaining popularity in the US and some other Western countries.",
            "In case of Russia’s Rosatom and its fuels subsidiary TVEL, the production of novel nuclear fuel is expected to be launched on the basis of Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) loctaed in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory. That will be a mixed oxide uranium-plutonium MOX fuel, that will be used for the world’s most powerful multi-purpose fast neutron research nuclear reactor, the MBIR, with an output of 150 MWth. The reactor is being built at the site of the Rosatom Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, in Ulyanovsk region. Commissioning of the reactor is scheduled for the second half of the 2020s.",
            "The capabilities of the MCC make it possible to organise the production of various types of nuclear fuel on its site, while the current MOX fuel which is produced uses depleted uranium and plutonium separated during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from thermal reactors.",
            "Rosatom has also plans to more actively promote its advanced nuclear fuel abroad. As part of this, the company has recently offered its advanced nuclear fuel to extend the Indian Kudankulam reactor cycle from 18 months to 2 years. In general, most analysts believe that Russia has good chances to secure a significant share in the global market for advanced fuels, which is partly due to their ability to access cheaper raw materials.",
            "High temperature reactor fuels",
            "The ever-growing interest in small high-temperature gas reactors reactors (HTGR) and the novel nuclear fuel needed for them has become one of the most obvious trends. At the turn of the 1990s–2000s, Japan commissioned a high-temperature technical reactor (HTTR) with a capacity of 30 MW. The fuel for it is TRISO – uranium microspheres packed in a multilayer cladding of silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon. The main function of the cladding is to retain fission products inside the microsphere and provide mechanical strength. Fuel spheres were placed in tubes, which were assembled into fuel assemblies. Work is underway to further improve the fuel. One option is to replace the silicon carbide in the microsphere cladding with zirconium carbide.",
            "In the US, the production of fuel for HTGRs is being developed by the companies including X-energy, BWXT, and USNC. The state supports R&D on this topic and also invests in the creation of industrial production of such fuel (through AGR, ARDP programs, for instance). In China, the CNNC company is building the HTR-PM project – an HTGR with a capacity of 200 MW. Here microspheres are poured directly into the reactor core in a “pebble bed” technology. This reactor also runs on TRISO fuel. The fuel cores, which are about 0.5 mm in diameter, consist of uranium enriched to 8.9% in a multilayer cladding.",
            "It’s clear that new kinds of nuclear fuels are emerging in response to both a new generation of reactors and new demands for safety and performance. Many of these fuels are still under development but there’s little doubt that novel nuclear fuel is set to become a commercial reality."

            "France’s Framatome is planning the construction of a nuclear fuel fabrication facility in the UK and is evaluating targeted local industrial sites in consultation with the UK Government’s Department for Energy Security & Net-Zero (DESNZ) and EDF.",
            "The current assessment of selected existing and former nuclear generation sites precedes detailed site justification and pre-licensing studies expected to be engaged in 2024 under the guidance of the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR).",
            "The project is part of Framatome’s strategy to scale up operations in the UK in preparation for the new generation of nuclear reactors. The facility will manufacture nuclear fuel for large pressurised water reactors (PWRs) and light water small modular reactors (SMRs) to supply the future UK nuclear fleet and to support wider deployment of SMRs in Europe. EDF is currently building two EPR reactors at Hinkley Point C, with a further two planned at Sizewell C. The UK government recently announced the preselection of six SMR designs with the aim of delivering operational reactors by mid-2030.",

        "text": [
            "During the World Nuclear Exhibition (WNE) 2023 in Paris, EDF Group signed several industrial cooperation agreements intended to secure the involvement of local supply chains and industries for the deployment of future EPR-technology-based and Nuward small modular reactor (SMR) projects in Europe and worldwide. These included agreements with Canada’s Ontario Power Group (OPG), various Czech companies and India’s Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL).",
            "According to Luc Rémont, EDF Chairman & CEO, the signing of these agreements demonstrates EDF’s ambition to secure robust partnerships with local supply chains for its EPR and Nuward technology. “We envision the same approach in any country where we promote our technologies with the profound objective to set-up a community of qualified European and worldwide suppliers and I look forward to seeing these cooperations materialising for the successful delivery of our nuclear newbuild worldwide,” he said.",
            "EDF and OPG signed a Letter of Interest to engage in a joint evaluation for the potential development of EPR technology in Ontario and other parts of Canada. EDF led a Canadian-French Supply Chain Workshop at the WNE attended by more than 20 Canadian and French participants, including AECON, Assystem, Bouygues Travaux Publics, Bruce Power, BWXT, Framatome, GE Vernova and OPG.",
            "OPG President & CEO Ken Hartwick said the two companies will initially explore the technical and licensing requirements for EPR technology deployment within Canada’s regulatory landscape. “They will also seek to understand the potential to leverage Ontario and Canada’s robust nuclear supply chain, to ensure maximum benefit to the provincial economy, should an EDF reactor be deployed in Canada.”",
            "Several cooperation agreements were signed with Czech companies for the delivery of the Dukovany 5 NPP. Cooperation agreements were signed with the Czech Power Industry Alliance (CPIA), ADAMEC, EnerSys, ISH Pumps, KLIKA BP, LDM, and Nopo Engineering. EDF said these agreements further underscore its “ambition to secure maximal local value and investment for the delivery of its potential project in the Czech Republic”.",
            "In the context of an earlier decision to build the six EPR units at India’s Jaitapur NPP (JNPP) project in Maharashtra, and in support of the “Make in India” initiative promoted by the Indian government, EDF said it “continues to build partnerships with Indian suppliers as part of its sound localisation strategy”. EDF signed a memorandum of cooperation with BHEL, the largest Power Sector EPC Company in India, “to collaborate with an intent to maximize the local content of the Jaitapur project”. EDF and BHEL will also explore further collaboration for the EPRs and for Nuward SMR.",
            "In regulatory filings with India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange, BHEL said that it will “explore the opportunity to maximise the local content of the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Plant Project (6×1650 MWe units) to be established by NPCIL [Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd] in India”. The JNPP project was first discussed in 2011 but made little progress due to concerns about economics and safety, local opposition, and the collapse of France’s Areva. In 2018, EDF and NPCIL signed an “industrial way forward” agreement for the project. In 2021 EDF submitted to NPCIL its binding techno-commercial offer to build the six reactors. However, the project has been slowed by several issues, including liability and the high cost of power per unit.",
            "During WNE, EDF also signed an international cooperation agreement with global engineering and construction company Egis whereby Egis will support EDF's localisation approach for its international projects. Egis is already engaged with EDF in the UK (Hinkley Point C) and in Poland and envisages the establishment with EDF and other partners of an engineering platform in India."

        "text": [
            "The possibility of using nuclear fuel from suppliers other than Russia’s TVEL at the Paks NPP has been legally enshrined in Hungary’s legislation. Members of the national parliament supported an amendment to the nuclear energy strategy proposed by the government. State Secretary at the Ministry of Energy Attila Steiner noted that Paks, Hungary’s only NPP currently uses nuclear fuel supplied by Rosatom enterprises.",
            "However, to ensure the safety and reliability of its operation in the long term, and also taking into account the ongoing attempts by the European Union to impose sanctions against Rosatom, the government decided to provide options for replacing Russian fuel, if necessary, he explained. For this purpose, national legislation was supplemented with a provision according to which “a nuclear power plant may use new, alternative fuel from another manufacturer, in particular during the period of extending its operating life.”",
            "The Hungarian government intends to extend the life of the Paks nuclear power plant. The current life of the four power VVER-440 units of the station was supposed to end in 2032-2037, but they are now expected to operate at least until 2052-2057. At the same time, the construction of the second stage of the NPP (Paks-II) is underway with two VVER-1200 units being built by Rosatom.",
            "Until 2022, fuel assemblies were delivered to Paks from Russia by rail through the territory of Ukraine, but after the outbreak of armed conflict, the route had to be changed. Now the cargo is transported by ship across the Black Sea under the protection of warships to the Bulgarian port of Varna, where it is loaded onto a train, and then transported through Bulgaria and Romania to Hungary. As a rule, NPPs maintain a fuel reserve for at least two years in advance.",
            "There is currently no alternative to Russian fuel for the four VVER-440 reactors, and the Hungarian government has repeatedly stated that it does not intend to abandon it as long as it can be supplied reliably. Speaking at the meeting, which was broadcast on the parliament website, Steiner noted that only Rosatom enterprises can now produce fuel assemblies for those units, so Hungary is interested in ensuring that they are not subject to sanctions. At the same time, he confirmed that, in accordance with the general policy of the European Union, Hungary will strive to diversify its energy supplies including nuclear energy.",
            "In line with this policy, the Hungarian Ministry of Energy in September signed a Memorandum of Cooperation on the operation and supply of NPP fuel with French corporation Framatome. France, which has the largest number of nuclear reactors in Europe, produces its own fuel for them, importing uranium from Australia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other countries.",
            "In recent years, the search for alternative fuels for Russian reactors in the European Union and Ukraine is mainly being carried out by the US-based Westinghouse, mainly under European projects such as APIS – “Accelerated Programme for Reliable Fuel Supply for VVER Reactors”. In July, a subsidiary of the Hungarian state energy company MVM, which operates Paks, joined the project.",

During the outage, the original three steam generators were replaced by three new steam generators. Unit 2 continued to generating electricity to the grid while the work took place and will continue to do so until the start of its next outage which will see its original three steam generators also replaced. The outage at unit 2 will start as soon as unit 1 is stable and all the required commissioning tests are complete, Eskom stated Although the unit 2 outage will be similar in terms of the scope, the lessons learnt from unit 1 will reduce the time needed with compromising nuclear safety.",
            "The replacement of steam generators at Koeberg has been identified by Eskom as a prerequisite for extending the operating licence of the plant beyond its original design life of 40 years. Eskom has already submitted a licence application to the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) for Koeberg’s operating life extension by additional 20 years, which is now being assessed.",
            "This milestone is as a result of the hard work and determination of the Eskom employees, suppliers, and contractors who have had to endure a long and challenging outage in the Koeberg Power Station’s history,” said Eskom’s Group Executive for Generation, Bheki Nxumalo. “I commend everyone involved on the project for ensuring that the unt was returned to service safely.”",
            "The two 930 MWe (net) pressurised water reactors at Koeberg, built by Framatome, began commercial operation in 1984 and 1985. They generate about 5% of the South Africa’s electricity. In 2014, Eskom signed a ZAR4.4bn ($240m) contract with Areva (now Orano) to design, manufacture and install the replacement steam generators. They were made in China under subcontract by Shanghai Electric Power Equipment Company.",

Framatome said the results validate the structural liner system for use in NPP safety-related applications for long-term plant operations and licence renewals.",
            "Framatome, working with industry partners, has developed an engineered structural spray-in-place liner system that is delivered remotely via in-pipe robotics. Using a robotic crawler, the fast-curing liner is sprayed evenly onto the inside of the pipe, fully rehabilitating the pipe, becoming the new pipe pressure boundary. The quick-installing system does not require excavation, thus minimizing safety risks and reducing outage duration.",
            "Buried pipes and underground components for NPP operations range from just a few inches to 11 feet in diameter. Ageing and degradation of buried piping is an industry challenge as the location of these components make necessary repairs and inspections costly. Framatome’s spray-in-place liner provides the nuclear industry with a safe solution that rehabilitates pipe internals and overcomes cost, safety and outage duration challenges.",
            "Craig Ranson, Senior Vice President of the Installed Base business unit in North America said “Our turnkey lining process saves our customers money and downtime, while solving buried piping ageing challenges and taking them to the end of the plant’s lifespan.” Testing and engineering evaluations were performed at Framatome’s Qualification & Testing Centre in Virginia.",

The tender for this contract began in 2019. Construction of the two units includes 69 civil structures. Preparatory work is expected to begin in mid-2024 once EDF obtains the necessary permits.",
            "The civil engineering phase will include the construction of turbine hall buildings, the reactor building containment – domes 70 metres in height and 50 metres in diameter – and a six-level operations building with a total floor space of 15,000 square metres. Eiffage says the work will require synergies between several of the Group’s areas of expertise. At its peak, this civil engineering phase will involve almost 4,000 people. In cooperation with the project stakeholders, the Group will also develop training programmes essential to the revival of the French nuclear industry.",
            "EDF in May 2021 had submitted to the government a proposal for the construction of the new EPR2 reactor programme. The aim is to contribute, alongside renewable energies, to achieving France's targets for decarbonisation of the economy and energy security. EDF plans to build three pairs of EPR2 reactors on sites at Penly, Gravelines (Hauts de France) and in the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region at Bugey or Tricastin.",
            "The Penly NPP currently houses two 1330 MWe class pressurised water reactors. In February 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time for a nuclear renaissance in France, adding that operation of all existing reactors should be extended without compromising safety and proposing construction of six new EPR2 reactors, with an option for eight more.",

The US insists that countries seeking to trade nuclear power goods and services must sign formal cooperation agreements. Such Section 123 Agreements relate to the relevant paragraph of the US 1954 Atomic Energy Act which requires them.",
            "Philippines Department of Energy (PDOE) Secretary Raphael PM Lotilla signed the Agreement on behalf of the Philippines as Chair of the Philippine Nuclear Energy Programme Inter-Agency Committee (NEPIAC). US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken signed on behalf of the US. The ceremony was witnessed by Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
            "The 123 Agreement lays the legal framework for potential nuclear power projects with US providers. It aims to facilitate Philippine-US cooperation in the safe and secure use of nuclear energy taking into full account the standards and safeguards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as in accordance with respective national laws, international agreements, and regulations.",
            "Introducing the signing ceremony, Ann Ganzer, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department of State’s Bureau of International Security & Nonproliferation, said the agreement “marks the culmination of negotiations between our governments launched less than one year ago”. She added: “Once in force, this agreement will provide the legal basis and facilitate US exports of most nuclear equipment and materiel to the Philippines for peaceful uses.”",
            "Blinken noted: “President Marcos has set an ambitious goal: cutting the Philippines greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2030 and increasing the production of clean energy so that 50% comes from renewable sources by the year 2040. The United States is committed to working with the Philippines so that it can meet those targets – using platforms like the very first US-Philippines Energy Policy Dialogue, which we hosted in Seattle back in August.”",
            "He continued: “With the Philippines’ leadership, we’re also working together to develop a nuclear energy sector in their country to fuel a reliable, secure, and affordable clean energy future. As peak energy demands are expected to nearly quadruple in the Philippines by 2040, nuclear power can consistently produce enough energy to meet communities’ critical needs without emitting more greenhouse gases. In a nation of more than 7,000 islands, small modular reactors … can generate energy locally and conveniently. Nuclear energy will also create inclusive economic opportunities for American and Filipino businesses alike, and good-quality, high-paying jobs in both of our countries.”",
            "The agreement will enable the US to share equipment and material with the Philippines, he added. “Already, we’ve organised workshops, we’ve hosted exchanges on these topics with American and Filipino researchers, officials, business leaders – to help train local experts and to share some of our best practices,” he said, adding “there’s a lot of work that remains ahead to turn this vision into concrete reality”.",
            "In his address, Philippines Secretary Lotilla recalled that a decade after the first atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima, the Philippines in 1955 joined the US Atoms for Peace programme. Building on this foundation, the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1958 and in 1963 a pre-investment study was initiated for a NPP in Luzon. A new Philippine-US agreement for civil nuclear cooperation was signed in 1968, replacing the 1955 agreement. This, for the first time, explicitly referred to the design, construction, and operation of power-producing reactors and research reactors. The Philippine congress then approve the Atomic Energy Regulatory & Liability Act.",
            "In 1971, the National Power Corporation was authorised by law to establish and operate NPPs after which a NPP was built but never operated. “The Philippine decision was nevertheless followed by an orderly and safe cessation of activities. More importantly, the 1987 Philippine constitution remained open to all peaceful uses of nuclear energy,” he said.",
            "President Marcos said he had earlier called for the re-evaluation of the possibility of safely developing nuclear energy in the Philippines, “recognising the enormous potential of nuclear energy given the new highly advanced technologies and standards of safety, security, and all the different safeguards that are now in place”. He added: “We see nuclear energy becoming a part of the Philippine energy mix by 2032, and we would be more than happy to pursue this path with the United States as one of our partners.",
            "Under the Philippine Energy Plan, Manila plans to produce 1,200 MWe using nuclear power by 2032, which would increase to 2,400 MWe by 2040 and to 4,800 MWe by 2050. The effort to revive nuclear power in the Philippines was begun by Marcos’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who was in power from 2016 to 2022 and whose relations with the US were somewhat strained.",
            "However, last year, Washington and Manila signed a memorandum of understanding on civil nuclear cooperation that included reviving the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, a 620 MWe pressurised light water reactor built by the US Westinghouse in 1976. Although the plant was completed it was almost immediately mothballed in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster after questions were raised about its excessive cost and poor safety, including its location near a major fault and the Pinatubo volcano.",
            "Separately from the 123 Agreement, Marcos Philippines electric company Meralco, which provides electricity in the Manila area, signed a deal during APEC with the US-based Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp (USNC) for a pre-feasibility study on Micro-Modular Reactors (MMRs). The agreement builds on the partnership between the two companies announced in August.",
            "Meralco Chairman & CEO Manuel V Pangilinan said “USNC is changing the nuclear safety and national energy security conversations in the Philippines with the MMR. This cooperative agreement moves us forward with a partner who understands these important issues alongside the essential nature of the cost and reliability of the electricity supply.”",
            "Under the agreement, USNC will conduct a four-month pre-feasibility study to familiarise Meralco with MMR systems and how these can be effectively utilised in the Philippines. Depending on the results, Meralco has the option to conduct a more detailed feasibility study with focus on the adoption and deployment of MMR energy systems.",
            "USNC’s MMR Energy System features a high temperature helium-cooled micro reactor that can provide up to 45 MWt of high-quality heat, delivered into a centralized heat storage unit. One or more MMR nuclear batteries combine their heat in the heat storage unit, from where electric power or superheated steam can be extracted through conventional means to meet a wide range of power requirements. USNC has also developed and patented its Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel planned to be used in the MMR.",

The news follows recent announcements including the establishment of a joint venture with Framatome Inc. to manufacture commercial quantities of advanced nuclear fuels, selecting a site for its MMR Assembly Plant, and the successful delivery of advanced TRISO fuel for NASA produced at USNC’s Pilot Fuel Manufacturing facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "“Meralco is demonstrating real leadership in advancing the energy security and sustainability roadmap for the Philippines,” said USNC founder & CEO Francesco Venneri. “Our MMR nuclear batteries can play a major role in delivering those benefits. The plans that will quickly follow this study place Meralco well on the way toward creating a reliable, low-carbon, equitable and secure future for Filipinos.”",

            "France’s Framatome has announced the launch of Framatome Space “putting its 65 years of nuclear and industrial expertise at the service of the space industry”. Framatome CEO Bernard Fontana said the company is proud to be part of the new age of space travel. “We already supply the space industry with domes for the tanks of launchers and hafnium for the hardened alloys for spacecraft. With the creation of Framatome Space we are taking things to the next level,” he noted, “The space industry is looking to nuclear to facilitate faster and more efficient missions. Who better than Framatome, with over six decades of experience and expertise in nuclear power, to contribute to the next giant leap for mankind?”",
            "Framatome is already supporting France’s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA – Commissariat à l'énergie Atomique et aux énergies Alternatives) and Ariane Group (a 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and Safran) with a feasibility study on a nuclear-thermal propulsion engine. It involves heating liquid hydrogen by passing it through a nuclear reactor core to transform it into gas at a high temperature, before ejecting it to generate thrust. Framatome says this would have two to three times greater efficiency than a conventional chemical engine and could halve time needed to travel to Mars from six to three months.",
            "Framatome “stands ready to play a decisive role in the future of space exploration”, said Grégoire Lambert, Vice President for Strategy at Framatome and Framatome Space. “We firmly believe that nuclear is a game changer to provide the amount of energy needed by any development.” He added: “With our vast experience in the design and supply of equipment, services and fuel for nuclear power plants, combined with our history of working for environments with very high constraints, Framatome has a wealth of expertise to offer as mankind prepares to travel to the furthest reaches of the universe.\""

The MOU seeks to facilitate the extension of the cooperation between Framatome and Hungary in various domains of interest in nuclear such as education and competencies, R&D, the implementation of new technologies, fuel supply and related nuclear materials, as well as long-term operation.",
            "Framatome CEO Bernard Fontana expressed strong support for Hungary’s nuclear industry and energy policy and said the agreement “further bears witness to the trust our customers have placed in our robust and reliable expertise and integrated supply chain over the years”. He added: “This MOU confirms our commitment to contribute to the diversification and security of fuel supply for the safe and reliable operation of the existing nuclear fleet and for preparing for the next generation of nuclear energy.”",
            "Framatome noted the longstanding relationship and cooperation with Hungary in nuclear operation and maintenance, as well as services to the Hungarian NPP. Framatome is present in Hungary through its subsidiary Framatome Kft, which provides direct support to Hungarian customers.",
            "Hungary’s Paks NPP comprises four Soviet-built VVER-440 reactors built between 1982 and 1987. Their 30-year operating period was extended by 20 years between 2012 and 2017. The plant accounts for about half of electricity generation in Hungary.",
            "The Paks II project was launched in 2014 by an inter-governmental agreement between Hungary and Russia for two VVER-1200 reactors (units 5&6) to be supplied by Rosatom. The contract was supported by a Russian state loan to finance the majority of the project. Despite opposition from some European Union (EU) states, the European Commission's has approved investment aid from Russia.",
            "The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority issued the licence for the units in August 2022. The following December, parliament approved the extension of the life of the four existing VVER-440 power units at the Paks NPP for another 20 years. The current life of the station's nuclear reactors would have ended in 2032-2037, and now it is assumed that they will work until at least 2052-2057.",
            "Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs & Trade Péter Szijjártó recently confirmed that preparatory groundwork was already underway for the construction of Paks-II.",
            "Framatome is particpating in the Paks-II project and was contracted to provide instrumental and control (I&C) equipment for the two units in a consortium with Germany’s Siemens. However, the involvement of Siemens became uncertain earlier this year due to delays in obtaining the relevant licences from the German Authorities. In March, Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs & Foreign Economic Relations, Peter Szijjártó said it Germany failed to give its permission, there were two options. Either Russia would supply the systems, “or we can arrange with the French that their Framatome company take over leadership of the consortium, so the French contribution to this project will increase”.",
            "Referring to the latest MOU with Framatome, Hungary’s Energy Minister Csaba Lantos said: “Without nuclear power plants, there is no security of supply, external exposures cannot be reduced, and climate protection commitments cannot be met.” He added: “At EU level, Hungary is one of the most committed supporters of the cooperation of the member states promoting the use of nuclear energy. France is our permanent ally in this fight, but Framatome is also a key player in European energy efficiency and competitiveness efforts. By strengthening our partnership, we are opening a new era in an ever-expanding and mutually fruitful cooperation.”",

            "“For several years now, Framatome has been developing an industrial solution to support the short- and mid-term needs of VVER nuclear operators, for both VVER-1000 and VVER 440 reactors,” noted Lionel Gaiffe, senior executive vice president of the Fuel Business Unit at Framatome. “In the short-term, Framatome will provide the proven and incumbent design and in the mid-term, Framatome is the only fuel supplier able to guarantee a sovereign European solution, with a fully-European design, manufacturing and components supply chain, thanks to our longstanding, proven expertise and track records.”",
            "There has been considerable press speculation that as a result of possible European sanctions on Russia’s nuclear industry, the Paks II project could be taken over by France. However, Hungarian officials have been adamant that Hungary will not allow the EU to impose sanctions on the Russian nuclear energy industry. Earlier this year Szijjártó said Budapest was facing tremendous pressure over the issue, but that this would change nothing. “Here and now, I would like to state again that this will definitely not happen. Hungary will not [agree] to nuclear [industry] sanctions of any kind, even minimal ones.”",
            "He reaffirmed this position, speaking at the 8th Central and Eastern Europe Nuclear Industry Congress being held in Prague. He noted that, even in times of conflict, rational thinking must be maintained. Europe had been hit by the gravest economic and security challenges of the past decades, with the energy crisis posing a major problem, he said. The continent has not given appropriate answers to the war in Ukraine, the EU’s policy of sanctions has failed, energy resources have diminished while energy prices have soared which all have led to Europe losing competitiveness, he said, adding that “without nuclear energy, the continent would be unable to regain its competitiveness”.",
            "He said nuclear energy was important in achieving environmental protection goals and praised the establishment of a pro-nuclear alliance led by France which already has 16 European member states, pledging to support for its plan to develop an integrated European nuclear industry reaching 150 GW of nuclear power capacity in the EU by 2050.",
            "However, he added that Hungary would reject any “attempt to approve sanctions on the nuclear industry” as this would seriously hurt the country’s national security and economic interests. On Paks, Szijjártó said the government’s aim with its expansion was for the country to achieve “climate neutrality” by 2050. He noted that the new units to be built as part of the international project would have a total capacity of 2,400 MWe and avoid the emission of 17m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.",
            "Szijjártó said the expansion of the nuclear project was progressing well with all permits obtained in the EU. He pointed out “attempts were made regularly by certain players to stymie the projects”, stressing that for Hungary “the security of energy supply is a matter of sovereignty”. He said: “We view attacks on the project as attempts to violate our right to make sovereign decisions about our national energy mix.”",

            "In recent months, nuclear power development in Asia has become the focus of growing attention. Globally, the number of nuclear reactors is increasing in Asia, while it is decreasing in Western Europe and North America. As the WNA notes: “Asia is the main region in the world where electricity generating capacity and specifically nuclear power are growing significantly. In Asia there are about 140 operable nuclear power reactors, about 30-35 under construction and firm plans to build an additional 40-50. Many more are proposed.”",
            "While this has been the trend for some time, it has accelerated in recent years, partly because of growing concerns about energy in general, following stringent Western sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. These considerations have, in some cases, even reversed the negative impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan, which saw a number of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan embark on nuclear-phase out policies.",
            "Another factor is the increasing number of small modular reactor (SMR) designs being offered to the market, encouraged by both private investment and government grants and awards. SMRs are being promoted as suitable for smaller countries that had hitherto ruled out standard NPPs as inappropriate or unaffordable.",
            "Asian countries with established nuclear power programmes or NPPs under construction include China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Bangladesh. Many others are now considering or reconsidering developing nuclear power, enticed by the promise of SMRs.",
            "In terms of operable nuclear power units, China leads Asia with 55~ ranking third worldwide. Next comes Japan with 33, but only 10 are currently operating. South Korea has 25, ranking fifth worldwide. India has 22, Pakistan six, Taiwan two and Bangladesh two under construction.",
            "China is largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western technology (from Canada, France and the US), which it is now exporting. Its 55 nuclear units at eight sites have a total capacity of 53,286 MWe. A further 23 units under construction at eight sites will add 24,296 MWe. In addition, some 45 units are planned totalling 50,110 MWe, with around 80 more firmly proposed.",
            "Three large state companies (and their subsidiaries) are responsible for NPP construction – China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and State Energy Investment Corporation (SPIC). The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are pressurised water reactors (PWRs), including the oldest unit, Qinshan 1, a 300 MWe Chinese-designed PWR, which started operating in 1991. Other technologies include pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs), high temperature gas cooled reactors (HTGRs) and fast neutron reactors (FNRs).",
            "Imported technologies include two Canadian Candu-6 PHWRs at Qinshan Phase III (Zhejiang province); French PWR M310 units at Daya Bay and Ling Ao and EPRs at Taishan (Guangdong province); Russian VVER-1000 and VVER-1200 PWRs at Tianwan (Jiangsu province) and Xudabao (Liaoning province); and US AP-1000 PWRs at Haiyang (Shandong province) and Sanmen (Zhejiang province).",
            "Indigenous development was based mainly on French M31 technology with CNNC and CGN producing slightly different versions: CNP1000, CNP600, CNP300, ACP300, ACP600, ACP1000 for CNNC; and CPR1000, M310+, ACPR1000 for CGN. The 1,000 MWe versions have now been integrated as the Hualong One (HPR1000). Three Hualong one units are already in operation in China with nine more under construction and others planned. China also adapted the US (Westinghouse) AP1000 under a technology transfer deal as the CAP1000 and CAP1400. Four CAP1000s are now under construction at sites originally planned for AP1000s.",
            "The Hualong One is China’s main export model. As yet, China has only exported NPPs to Pakistan, but the country also expects to finalise an agreement with Argentina. The UK cancelled plans for construction of a Hualong One at its Bradwell-on-Sea site largely for political reasons and China was also excluded from NPP tenders in the Czech Republic and Poland.",
            "China is also pushing ahead with SMRs and advanced reactors. CNNC’s SMR demonstration project at the Changjiang NPP (Hainan province) features the multi- purpose125 MWe ACP-100 (Linglong One) developed from the larger ACP1000 PWR. It is designed for electricity generation, urban heating and cooling, industrial steam production, or seawater desalination. Construction of the main internal structure for the reactor building has been completed. It was the first SMR project to pass an independent safety assessment by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts in 2016. In 2017, a joint venture was set up by China National Nuclear Power Co (part of CNNC) and four other domestic companies to develop and produce small, floating NPPs. Its remit was R&D, construction, operation & management and sales including possible exports.",
            "China is also building two demonstration pool-type sodium-cooled CFR-600 fast reactors in Xiapu county, Fujian province, as part of its plans to establish a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Construction of the first CFR-600 began in 2017 based on the China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) in Beijing. The CEFR was built with the assistance of Russia, which is supplying fuel for both the CEFR and CFR-600.",
            "Before the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan’s 54 reactors at 17 NPPs generated 30% of its power with plans to increase the share to 40%. All 54 were closed after the accident and new stringent safety standards were introduced by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in 2013. A total of 21 reactors were closed permanently, leaving 33 operable units totalling 31,679 MWe at 13 NPPs. As yet only 10 units (9,486 MWe) are in operation at six NPPs. Others are in the process of being reactivated or undergoing modifications to meet the new regulations with 16 awaiting regulatory approval to restart. Work stopped on two reactors that were under construction in 2011 (Shimane 3 and Ohma 1) and they are still facing delays. Japan’s NPPs all operate light water reactors (LWRs), the first of which were bought from US vendors such as General Electric and Westinghouse. Japanese companies were subcontracted to take part in construction and these were later licensed to build similar plants. Companies such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (MHI) developed the capacity to design and construct LWRs and by the late 1970s, Japan had established a domestic nuclear power industry. Currently it exports equipment worldwide and is also developing new reactor designs. MHI is designing an advanced 1200 MWe LWR (SRZ-1200) in cooperation with four EPCs (Kansai, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku.)",
            "Reactor restarts have been slower than expected. In 2022, nuclear only accounted for around 8% of electricity supply. The government’s Green Transformation (GX) strategic plan assumes that nuclear will account for 20–22% by 2030. Japan’s reactors include both PWRs, boiling water reactors (BWRs) and advanced BWRs (ABWRs). To date only PWRs have been restarted as BWRs require a filtered containment venting system, complicating the upgrades needed to meet the new regulations. Parliament recently endorsed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s policy to allow reactor operation beyond the 60-year limit set after Fukushima and to replace ageing facilities with next-generation advanced reactors.",
            "Japan had planned to use FNRs as part of a wider policy to expand the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel, with up to 18 reactors designated to use MOX. After Fukushima this was reduced to 12, only four of which are approved for operation, with three still awaiting approval to restart. Moreover, operation of the Monju FNR and Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s (JAEA’s) Joyo experimental FNR was impeded by a series of technical and political problems. This ultimately led to Monju’s closure but in May 2023, NRA said Joyo had met regulatory standards, and could restart.",
            "Japan is working closely with the USA on FNR development. JAEA, MHI, and Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR) recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US-based Terrapower to develop sodium-cooled fast reactor technology. This is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Design Demonstration Program (ARDP). MHI said Japan will accelerate innovations in various nuclear technologies through international collaboration on next-generation innovative reactors. Terrapower’s Natrium reactor is also being developed jointly with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy.",
            "In 2021, JAEA also resumed operation of its 30 MW experimental High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), closed for more than 10 years, after the HTGR was upgraded to meet the new regulatory requirements. JAEA is also co-operating with Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research to design a HTGR.",
            "Like China, South Korea is now largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western (mainly US) technology, which it is now exporting. Its 25 nuclear units at four sites have a total capacity of 24,489 MWe and account for around 27% of its electricity needs. Three more units under construction at two sites will add 4,020 MWe, with two units planned totalling 2,800 MWe.",
            "Most of South Korea’s nuclear units are LWRs apart from four Candu-6 PHWRs at its Wolsong NPP. South Korea’s first nuclear unit, Kori 1 (now closed), a Westinghouse unit built on a turnkey basis, began operation in 1978. Seven more were built in the 1980s based Westinghouse and Framatome technology including two involving Combustion Engineering (CE), which became part of Westinghouse. Korea’s ambitions to develop its own nuclear technology for export led to new reactor designs being developed. In 2005 the OPR- 1000 (Optimised Power Reactor) was launched with an eye to Asian markets. South Korea now has 10 operating OPR-1000 units and has since developed the Generation III APR-1400, three of which are in operation.",
            "Korea has an extensive nuclear R&D base and manufacturing capacity including state-owned Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Electric Power Co (Kepco) and subsidiary Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) as well as heavy engineering companies such as Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, and Doosan. These dominate the domestic market and are increasingly active globally.",
            "Projects include a variety of advanced reactors and SMRs, including the 330MWt System-Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART) reactor, which began development in 1997. In 2015 the SMART Power Company Ltd was launched supported by six supply chain companies to promote exports particularly to the Middle East and a co-operation agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia. Korea is also working on a sodium-cooled FNR in close co-operation with the US, and a HTGR for hydrogen generation.",
            "Korea is driven by considerations of energy security and the need to minimise dependence on imported fuels and technology. Kepco markets the OPR1000 and APR1400 globally. In 2009 the APR1400 was selected by the UAE for its four-unit Barakah NPP, now almost complete with three units already in operation ahead of schedule and within budget. Korea also won a contract in 2009 to supply a research reactor to Jordan, which was commissioned in 2016. In 2010 Korea announced plans to export 80 reactors by 2030, targeting 20% of the global market. It aimed to be 100% self-sufficient in nuclear technology by 2012, with no residual intellectual property constraints. US design certification for the APR1400 was finally approved in 2019 and in 2023 a new APR1000 design, specifically developed for the European market, was certified by the European Utility Requirements organisation. The success of the UAE project sparked interest worldwide and preliminary agreements were signed with several countries.",
            "Despite Fukushima, Korea announced plans in 2012 to increase nuclear’s share to 60% by 2035. However, in the face of growing public opposition, the government in 2013 drafted a reduced plan for a 29% nuclear share by 2035 and in 2017, the new government of President Moon Jae-in adopted a phase out plan. By the time this policy was reversed in 2023 by President Yoon Suk-yeol, the nuclear industry had lost a lot of ground. The new target was a 34.6% nuclear share by 2036, the export of 10 NPPs by 2030 and development of a Korean SMR design for export.",
            "Korea’s ties to the US have also complicated its nuclear development. The 1974 Korea-US Atomic Energy Agreement that limited raw material supply and banned uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing in Korea was extended for 20 years in 2015. Faced with pressure from Korea, the renewed agreement was framed more as a partnership, but it still contained restrictions. In May 2022 Korea joined the US-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme during a visit from US President Joe Biden’s visit to Korea to collaborate in promoting the global deployment of SMRs.",
            "However, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against KHNP after it signed an agreement with Polish private company ZE PAK to build an APR1400 at a former coal plant. This came after a tender to supply reactors for Poland’s nuclear power programme was awarded to Westinghouse. This also undermined Korea’s plans for possible exports to the Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit alleged intellectual property infringement by KHNP insisting on US government consent for export of the APR1400 claiming that it uses Westinghouse technology.",
            "India’s largely indigenous nuclear power programme is self- sufficient in reactor design and construction. Its 22 operable reactors at seven sites have a total capacity of 6,795 MWe, although three are currently suspended for repair leaving 19 operating units with a total capacity of 6,290 MWe. Eight more units under construction at four sites will add 6,028 MWe, with 12 further units planned. Nuclear currently accounts for around 1.5% of India’s installed power capacity. In April 2023 the government announced plans to increase nuclear capacity to 22,480 MWe by 2031, with nuclear accounting for nearly 9% of India’s electricity by 2047.",
            "The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are Indian designed PHWRs. Other technologies include India’s first power reactor, a Canadian supplied Candu at Rajasthan NPP, which started up in 1973 and closed in 2004; two BWRs built by GE on a turnkey contract at Tarapur NPP (currently suspended); and two VVERs (PWRs) at Kudankulam supplied by Russia. India is also building a 500 MWe FNR at Kalpakkam. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is responsible for construction and operation of India’s NPPs and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (Bhavini) is responsible for FNR development.",
            "Engineering companies, such as state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL), are key players in nuclear construction. The 1962 Atomic Energy Act prohibited private control of nuclear power generation. Amendments in 2016 only allow public sector joint ventures and direct foreign investment only in the supply chain and not in construction.",
            "India has a large and sophisticated nuclear R&D and manufacturing base, having launched its first research reactor, supplied by the UK, in 1957. Initially nuclear development was supported mainly by the UK, Canada, the US and France. However, after India’s nuclear bomb test in 1974, all support was withdrawn. The newly established Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), from which India was excluded, prevented India from importing any nuclear technology or fuel, setting it on a path of independent nuclear development.",
            "With limited uranium resources, India embarked on a three-stage programme aimed at using its abundant thorium resources based on an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle. Stage 1 would use PHWRs and LWRs. Plutonium from these would fuel the fast reactors planned for Stage 2. Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) in Stage 3 would burn thorium-plutonium fuels in a self- sustaining fuel cycle. An alternative end stage could be molten salt breeder reactors (MSBRs).",
            "India immediately embarked on construction of small PHWRs and by 2008, 12 200-220 MWe units were in operation at five sites, as well as two 540 MWe units at Tarapur NPP.",
            "In 2002 the regulatory authority approved construction of a 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, which is now nearing completion, while research is underway on molten salt reactors (MSRs).",
            "Only Russia continued cooperation based on a 1988 agreement that pre-dated the NSG, and in 2002 began construction of two VVER-1000 units at the Kudankulam NPP. Then, in 2005, India signed a civil nuclear agreement with the US, leading in 2008 to an NSG waiver for India, despite its not signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). This enabled nuclear trade to resume but negotiations to include India as a full NSG member have so far stalled on Chinese opposition. Nevertheless, the waiver enabled India to sign nuclear cooperation agreements with numerous countries and to start discussions with the US, France, Japan and South Korea on possible construction.",
            "However, India’s nuclear liability regime impeded progress. Following the 1984 Bhopal disaster India passed a law, making equipment suppliers responsible for any future accident. Amendments in 2010 made plant operators primarily liable but still allowed possible recourse to suppliers. A compromise was reached with Russia, which continued construction at Kudankulam, where two units are now operating with two more under construction and others planned. Other suppliers remained hesitant. While projects were agreed with France for six EPRs at Jaitapur and with the US for six AP1000s at Kovvada, they have not been finalised. India, meanwhile, embarked on a programme to build larger 700 MWe PHWRs, the first of which began operating at the Kakrapar NPP (unit 3) in 2021, with plans for 10 more.",
            "Pakistan has six operable reactors at two sites supplied on a turnkey basis by China, with a total capacity of 3,262 MWe. Four CNP-300 reactors (300-315 MWe) at the Chasma NPP site began operation between 2011 and 2017. In June 2023, Pakistan and China signed an agreement for construction of a 1,100 MWe Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor for Chasma 5. Unit 1 at the Karachi NPP site, a 137 MWe Candu supplied by Canada that began operation in 1971 and closed in 2021 was the first nuclear power unit in Asia. The site also hosts two Chinese supplied 1,017 MWe Hualong One units that began operation in 2021 and 2022. Over the coming decade Pakistan plans to expand its nuclear power generating capacity to 8,800 MWe.",

Other facilities in Rawalpindi and Khushab continue to support weapons development.",
            "Like India, Pakistan is excluded from the NSG. However, all its power units are under IAEA safeguards and IAEA oversight and support is ongoing. In 2018 four IAEA national technical cooperation projects were amalgamated into a single project, PAK2007, “Strengthening and Enhancing Capabilities of Pakistan’s National Institutions to Support a Safe, Reliable & Sustainable Nuclear Power Programme”. This aims to streamline workflows, reduce delays and costs, enhance cooperation and harmonise safety and waste management approaches.",
            "Two of Taiwan’s three US-supplied two-unit NPPs (Chinshan, Kuosheng and Maanshan) have now been closed in line with a nuclear phase-out law adopted in 2016. A fourth NPP under construction, Lungmen, was cancelled. Taiwan’s six operable power reactors are to be decommissioned as their 40-year operating licences expire. Chinshan 1, Taiwan’s oldest plant, closed in 2018, followed by Chinshan 2 in 2019. These 600 MWe General Electric (GE) Mark I BWRs began operation in 1978 and 1979. Kuosheng 1&2, 985 MWe GE Mark III BWRs, which began operation in 1981 and 1983, were closed in 2021 and 2023. Construction of Lungmen 1&2 (both GE 1350 MWe ABWR units) began in 1999. Lungmen 1 was completed but mothballed in 2015, and construction of Lungmen 2 was suspended in 2014.",
            "Taiwan now has two operable nuclear units at the Maanshan plant, both Westinghouse 936 MWe PWRs, whose operating licences expire in 2024 and 2025. Owner-operator Taipower also operates coal power plants, which are to be replaced by natural gas turbines. Taiwan’s first deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are expected in 2023. While there is strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Taiwan, the opposition Kuomintang Party, which is expected to win the forthcoming elections, opposed the nuclear phase out.",
            "While early nuclear development in Asia was largely influenced by regional rivalries, today it is the focus of a global power struggle between China and the US. India has so far largely avoided involvement in this geopolitical game. Pakistan’s close ties with China are evident, as are South Korea’s and Japan’s ties with the US. China would clearly like to increase exports of its Hualong One and also SMRs, including floating NPPs, and is increasingly becoming a competitive vendor. There are numerous other runners and riders looking to embrace nuclear power, especially with the emergence of smaller modular reactors that are more appropriate in places where a full-sized NPP might be more challenging to justify. Longer term, it seems likely that Asia will continue to expand both its nuclear capacity and capabilities.",

This followed an international tender for the supply of nuclear fuel and related services throughout the supply chain for the production of nuclear fuel. SE says the aim of the agreement is to diversify the supply of nuclear fuel for VVER 440 power plants in Slovakia.",
            "“Securing another nuclear fuel supplier for our power plants is an important step in strengthening Slovakia’s energy security. Nuclear power plants represent an important pillar in our country's energy mix, therefore I consider it to be crucial to secure nuclear fuel supply diversification for their stable operation,” said SE Director General Branislav Strýček.",
            "Slovakia operates five VVER-440 nuclear power units at two NPP sites – Mochovce 1,2&3 and Bohunice 3&4. A sixth unit, Mochovce 4, still under construction, is expected to be connected next year. Previously fuel for Slovakia’s NPPs was supplied by Russia’s TVEL, but in line with European policy Slovakia is seeking to diversify suppliers.",
            "According to SE, the first fuel supplies from Westinghouse are expected within approximately one year after approval for use of the fuel is received from the regulator. “The fuel supplied by Westinghouse Electric Sweden must first undergo the licensing process, to approve its use in Slovak power plant reactors, as part of which it must be demonstrated that its use will be safe,” SE noted.",
            "Slovakia’s diversification strategy is to have at least two alternative nuclear fuel suppliers and several potential suppliers of materials and services throughout the supply chain, SE said.",
            "“We are very pleased to contribute to Slovakia’s fuel diversification and to strengthen our long-standing partnership with Slovenské Elektrárne,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “We offer the only fully-Western alternative fuel for this type of reactor and remain committed to supporting Slovakia’s operating fleet, leveraging our Swedish fabrication footprint.\"",
            "Westinghouse had earlier developed fuel for VVER-1000 reactors, but the design for VVER-440 fuel is still under development. At the end of 2022, Spain’s Enusa Industrias Avanzadas and Westinghouse formalised a cooperation agreement regarding the manufacture of VVER-440 fuel. Enusa began to reinstall a production line for this product at its Juzbado factory with the aim of licensing it in 2023 to make possible fuel deliveries from the beginning of 2024.",
            "Through this agreement, Westinghouse and Enusa will manufacture the fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain, as supply contracts are signed.",
            "Westinghouse and Enusa have partnered since 1974 under a Pressurised-Water Reactor (PWR) fuel technology transfer agreement supporting plants in Spain, Belgium, and France among others. In 1999, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) bought Westinghouse’s commercial nuclear power businesses. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to Fortum’s Loviisa NPP in Finland, which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "These designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006 when Westinghouse was purchased by Toshiba. However, the Loviisa fuel contract was not renewed and Westinghouse withdrew from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "In 2014 reactivation of the VVER-440 market was reconsidered and Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe.

This is the most significant part of the complex project and Eskom is now able to proceed with other outage activities that could not be undertaken in parallel with replacement of the steam generators. Once the outage activities are completed, the reactor will be reloaded with fuel in preparation for its return to service. Commissioning operations, including the necessary tests of the new steam generators, will take place while the unit is synchronised to the grid.",
            "The two 930 MWe (net) pressurised water reactors at Koeberg, built by Framatome, began commercial operation in 1984 and 1985. They generate about 5% of the South Africa’s electricity. In 2014, Eskom signed a ZAR4.4bn ($240m) contract with Areva (now Orano) to design, manufacture and install the replacement steam generators. They were made in China under subcontract by Shanghai Electric Power Equipment Company.",
            "Replacement of the steam generators at unit 1 had originally been planned for the first half of 2021, with those of unit 2 to be replaced between January and May 2022. However, this was delayed mainly because of concerns about possible power shortages while the units are offline. The current licence expires in 2024-2025 and in 2021 Eskom applied to South Africa's National Nuclear Regulator to extend the operating licence. Eskom submitted the safety case for long-term operation in support of the application in July 2022. The regulator has two years to conclude the review and provide an outcome. No safety concerns have been identified that would preclude long term operation.",
            "Koeberg 1 is now planned to be commercially available on 3 November. Because of the delays, the outage of unit 2 has been postponed until 7 November to ensure that there is no simultaneous shutdown of both units and that resources in place to begin the initial for the unit 2 outage.",
            "Eskom said replacement of the steam generators was a first of its kind complex nuclear project to be performed at Koeberg and is the last major plant component out of the three to be replaced on the unit as part of the Long-Term Operation (LTO) project. The other two components – the replacement of the Refuelling Water Storage Tanks and the Reactor Vessel Closure Heads – have been replaced in previous years on both units. The replacement of the steam generators is the last of the large components that Eskom needed to replace in support of its application to operate the Koeberg units for another 20 years. The new steam generators are also more efficient and will produce an additional 27 MWe.",
            "Eskom said the Koeberg units have operated safely and reliably for almost 40 years. “The amendment of the operating licence will enable Koeberg to continue providing safe, clean, and reliable power to the grid, and playing the essential role of stabilising supply in the Western Cape, which unit 2 has safely continued to do with an excellent energy availability factor of 94.87%, while unit 1 was on outage.”",

            "France’s Framatome says its Enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (EATF) assembly has completed its first cycle of operation at unit 2 of the US Calvert Cliffs NPP in Maryland, marking significant progress and an important step toward market readiness of accident tolerant fuel (ATF) technology. Some 24 months of operation, testing and inspections “confirm the robust fuel characteristics safely withstood in-reactor conditions and performed as designed”, Framatome noted.",
            "Lionel Gaiffe, Senior Executive Vice President, Fuel Business Unit at Framatome said: “Collectively, we are one step closer in the qualification of our PROtect EATF technology for the nuclear industry. With the adoption and implementation of our enhanced technologies, our industry partners continue to demonstrate their commitment to enhance the safety and performance of their reliable, low-carbon, energy operations.”",
            "The lead fuel assembly (LFA) was developed with funding from US Department of Energy (DOE) and the French Recovery Plan under Framatome’s PROtect programme. It contains 176 chromium-coated rods and chromia-enhanced pellets and was initially inserted during the NPP’s 2021 spring refuelling outage.",
            "The PROtect EATF LFA was removed and inspected during the 2023 spring refuelling outage with the results confirming the integrity of the technology after two years in operation. It is now operating in its second two-year cycle of operation.",
            "Framatome said the EATF fuel assembly “builds on previous work that included completing 18- and 12-month fuel cycle tests on lead fuel rods in the US and Switzerland respectively. The PROtect EATF chromium-coated cladding and chromia-enhanced pellets are more tolerant to changes in reactor core temperatures, increasing coping time while reducing corrosion and the production of hydrogen under high-temperature conditions.",
            "The LFA was fabricated at Framatome’s manufacturing facility in Richland, Washington, as part of a 2019 contract with Exelon that marked the fourth different reactor type to implement PROtect EATF technologies.",
            "Earlier in July, Framatome signed a collaboration agreement with EDF to begin reactor tests of its (EATF technology at a French NPP. Framatome will manufacture and deliver four lead fuel assemblies (LFAs) that will be inserted in one of the EDF’s reactors later this year. To date Framatome’s PROtect EATF solutions have been implemented in four different NPPs in the US and one in Europe.",
            "Currently, Framatome, GE Hitachi with GNF, and Westinghouse – are working with DOE to develop new fuels under its Accident Tolerant Fuel programme. Westinghouse and EDF agreed in July 2022 to investigate the functionalities of Westinghouse's EnCore ATF technology. Westinghouse said earlier that it would deliver EnCore assemblies with lead test rods to EDF from its fuel fabrication facility in Västerås, Sweden, during 2023. Various types of ATF fuel are also under development in Russia.",

        "text": [
            "France’s Nuclear Policy Council (CPN – Conseil de Politique Nucléaire), chaired on by President Emmanuel Macron, has selected the Bugey NPP in Ain for the construction of two next-generation EPR2 reactors. Earlier it was decided that the Penly NPP in Normandy and Gravelines in Hauts-de-France would also each host two EPR2s.",
            "Macron in February 2022 announced plans to renew the French nuclear fleet, with six new reactors (EPR2s) for commissioning by 2035 with an option for eight more or the late 2040s. The cost of the project total €52bn ($57.6bn) according to initial estimates. An update of this assessment is in progress. The conclusions of the programme review on the costs and design of the first six EPR2s are expected \"by the end of summer, beginning of autumn\", according to the office of Minister for Energy Transition Agnès Pannier-Runacher.",
            "In May 2021, EDF submitted to the State a proposal for the construction of the new EPR2 reactor programme in France. It proposed construction of three pairs of EPR2 reactors, in order, at Penly, Gravelines and at either Bugey or Tricastin.",
            "During a visit to the Bugey site following the CPN meeting, Pannier-Runacher explained that the choice of the site was based on “technical issues” to “maintain schedules”. The Bugey site was favoured over the Tricastin NPP, also under consideration, because it would be possible “to launch construction as quickly as additional studies need to be carried out on the Tricastin site”, Pannier-Runacher’s office stated, adding that it was “a rational choice to keep the schedules as tight as possible\".",
            "However, studies are continuing and the Tricastin site could later accommodate additional reactors, according to the Élysée",
            "statement on the CPN meeting. “Technical studies and analyses will continue on the Tricastin site with a view to hosting future nuclear reactors.” It noted. For the time being, EDF has not provided the government with the list of potential sites for the additional eight EPR2s. \"The studies are still in progress, we are at the very beginning of this process led by EDF, a Pannier-Runacher’s office said.",
            "As to the possibility of constructing an EPR2 at the industrial basin of Fos-sur-Mer, mentioned by Macron during a recent trip to Marseille, this reflects a wish to “match\" the future of the nuclear fleet \"with the needs of our industry\", the cabinet noted. It is also the expression of the wish “to look openly at future locations for the park beyond the six EPRs”. In other words, the government does not want limit possible sites to those that already have NPPs.",
            "The CPN also decided to “significantly increase the number of staff and renew the research facilities of the civil nuclear branch of the Atomic Energy Commission, which will play a central role in coordinating and steering research”. This “will make it possible both to attract new talent and to strengthen research in this area of ​​excellence to cover all the subjects necessary for the extension of the fleet by guaranteeing a high level of safety in their operation, at the mastery of the fuel cycle, to the construction of new power plants, whether EPR2 or small innovative reactors”. In addition, the post of High Commissioner for Atomic Energy “will now be attached to the Prime Minister”.",
            "The CPN gave a progress report on the implementation of the EPR2 programme, after promulgation of the law relating to the acceleration of procedures linked to the construction of new nuclear installations. “The various implementing texts for this law are being deployed in order to meet the schedule for the start of work in Penly by 2025,” it said. With the selection of Bugey, “the locations for the first phase of the EPR2 construction programme has now been decided.”",
            "EDF says it is \"engaged in the authorisation procedures required for the launch of the construction of the first pair of EPR2 reactors at Penly, as well as the administrative procedures for its completion and its link-up to the electricity grid\". It is hoping to start preparatory work for the new Penly reactors in mid-2024.",
            "The first unit of the third pair of EPR2s is expected to start up in 2042 on the Bugey site, according to the French nuclear society, SFEN (Société française d'énergie nucléaire). The new nuclear reactor construction programme in France is taking shape, SFEN said, noting that EDF has recently submitted its construction authorisation request for the construction of two EPR2s at Penly while the second pair of reactors is planned at Gravelines.",
            "However, there has been some opposition to the Bugey plans from the Metropolis and the City of Lyon as well as from environmentalists. Bruno Bernard, President of the Metropolis of Lyon and Grégory Doucet, Mayor of the City earlier co-signed a letter addressed to Pannier-Runacher opposing the project on safety grounds and stressing the need to protect the waters of the Rhône, which are used for cooling the Bugey plant. Bernard told La Tribune that “90% of our drinking water resources depend on the Rhône…. There are different predictions, but overall we are talking about 30% reduction in the flow of the Rhône in 2050. Adding a new EPR in Bugey to these difficulties is not acceptable.”",
            "SFEN acknowledged that unlike Penly and Gravelines, which are near the sea, the Bugey site is located on the banks of the river. “Access to the cold spring must be closely observed in a context of global warming and increased occurrences of drought in France. Due to climate change, some are already warning about the lack of water in the Rhône in the years to come to ensure cooling. In reality, this risk is relatively low, SFEN said.",
            "On the Bugey site, there are already four 900 MWe reactors, two in open cycle, two in closed cycle. Currently, the net water withdrawal of the plant represents between 0.1% and 0.3% of the flow of the Rhône depending on the month, SFEN explained. EDF, anticipated the impact of the presence of two EPR2s which would consume less than 1% of the river flow.",
            "EDF and Framatome are developing the EPR2 as a simplified version of the EPR design based on design, construction and commissioning experience feedback from the EPR reactors under construction in France (Flamanville), Finland (Olkiluoto) and the UK (Hinkley Point C) as well as those operating in China at the Taishan NPP. France’s state audit office says EDF must ensure the financing and profitability of the proposed EPR2 reactor before starting any construction in France.",

        "text": [
            "India and France have agreed to strengthen their defence and security partnership following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to France at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron. Following extensive discussions, a joint communique noted the strengthening of the strategic partnership between the two countries. Among other things, it “recognised that the promotion of clean and low-carbon energy, the preservation of biodiversity, the protection of the oceans and the fight against pollution were essential aspects of cooperation”.",
            "The talks also resulted in the adoption of a \"Roadmap for the 25th anniversary of the Franco-Indian strategic partnership by 2047” detailing the issues discussed. This included a paragraph on nuclear power, noting that the two countries welcomed progress made during the discussions on the Jaitapur nuclear power plant project. It welcomed “EDF's proposal to train Indian engineers and technicians specialising in civil nuclear power for projects related to EPR technology”.",
            "It noted that, in accordance with the Skills India initiative, “the competent French organisations will also work with their Indian counterparts to strengthen training in the nuclear field and to encourage internships for Indian students”. The two countries “also agreed to establish a partnership on low- and medium-power modular reactors, or Small Modular Reactors (SMR) and Advanced Modular Reactors (AMR)”. They will also “continue their cooperation on the Jules Horowitz research reactor to develop nuclear technologies and will deepen their exchanges”.",
            "In April 2021, Electricite de France (EDF) finally submitted to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd (NPCIL) a binding techno-commercial offer to develop six EPR reactors at the Jaitapur site in Maharashtra with an installed capacity of 9.6 GWe. This was the culmination of the work carried out jointly with NPCIL following adoption of the Industrial Way Forward Agreement (IWFA) in March 2018 during the visit of Macron to New Delhi, and to the submission of EDF's non-binding proposal at the end of 2018.",
            "The agreement had been a long time coming. The Jaitapur project had been under discussion since 2009, and received initial environmental approval in 2010. A contract for pre-engineering studies was signed by Areva and NPCIL in April 2015, but EDF subsequently took over the project after Areva sold its reactor arm to EDF. However, the project continued to face delays due to multiple local protests and French concerns about liability issues.",
            "The project was revived in January 2016 during French President Francois Hollande’s visit to India with the aim of starting the implementation of the project in early 2017. The March 2018 IWFA provided for a preliminary tender by EDF to be submitted in the following weeks, and a ‘binding’ EDF tender by the end of that year. However, India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), which controls NPCIL, maintained that no foreign reactor design could be built unless a reference plant was operational. So, the ‘final’ contract was deferred until DAE could study the post-commissioning progress of Taishan 1 in China or Flamanville 3 in France.",
            "Nevertheless, in June 2018, GE and EDF signed a strategic cooperation agreement for the planned construction of the Jaitapur project as a step towards implementing the IWFA. Although the 2021 EDF offer included the detailed technical configuration of the reactors, taking into consideration information on the site conditions, and the terms and conditions for the supply of engineering studies and equipment for the six reactors, the project has so far made little progress.",
            "The Jules Horowitz Reactor, under construction at Cadarache in southern France is being built under the framework of an international consortium of research institutes from Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the European Commission, as well as major companies such as EDF, Framatome and TechnicAtome. Partners from India and Japan have also joined the consortium.",
            "It remains to be seen whether the latest talks will accelerate the development of these joint projects.",

            "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has been selected as the core company in charge of the conceptual design of a demonstration fast reactor which the government aims to put into operation in the 2040s. MHI will oversee both the conceptual design as well as research and development for a sodium-cooled fast reactor in partnership with Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR), an MHI Group engineering company established in 2007 to handle the development and design of fast reactors. The design work for the new reactor is scheduled to begin in fiscal 2024.",
            "The government adopted a \"strategic roadmap\" for fast reactor development in December 2018, which sought to assess the efficacy of various types of fast reactors to be developed following a technological competition among private-sector corporations. The roadmap was revised in December 2022, at which time two decisions were taken:",
            "to select a sodium-cooled fast reactor as the target of the conceptual design which would get underway in fiscal 2024; and",
            "to select a manufacturer as the core company in charge of the design and R&D which would proceed with technology development in accordance with the goals and policy directions established by the government.",
            "Japan’s experience with fast reactors has been a difficult one. In June, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) approved a screening report concluding that the Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s Joyo experimental fast reactor had met new regulatory standards, which were a prerequisite for its restart. A period of public consultation is now underway.",
            "JAEA is hoping to restart Joyo, located in the town of Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture, at the end of fiscal 2024. The sodium-cooled fast reactor began operation in 1977, and is Japan’s only operational fast reactor since the closure of Monju in 2016. Monju, which achieved criticality in 1994, was shut down in 1995 after a sodium coolant leak and fire. It was restarted in 2010 but was shut down three months later after a fuel handling machine was accidentally dropped into the reactor during a refuelling outage. Joyo was shut down in 2007 after a test sub-assembly became jammed in the reactor vessel Special equipment had to be designed to retrieve it, which finally took place in 2014.",
            "In the report, the NRA confirmed that Joyo is now equipped with a device to detect sodium leaks, as well as nitrogen gas equipment to be used in the event of such leaks. It concluded that the reactor meets fire safety standards.",
            "In 2007, MHI had been selected as the core company in charge of a research programme which was focused on the practical uses of fast reactors. The selection took into account MHI's technologies and experience based on its participation in the development and construction of the Joyo and reactors. MHI, in partnership with MFBR has since been developing plant conceptual studies and R&D. In view of the lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011, MHI proposed the concept of a safety-enhanced sodium fast reactor at the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). Together with JAEA, MHI led a study on global safety standardisation and the results were applied in the joint design and development of France's next-generation fast reactors.",
            "France’s Framatome and the Commissariat a l'energie atomique et aux energies alternatives (CEA – Atomic & Alternative Energies Commission) in 2019 signed a cooperation agreement with JAEA MHI and MFBR. This followed the agreement established in 2014 for the Astrid [Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration] sodium-cooled fast reactor project, which was subsequently cancelled. In 2022, MHI, JAEA and MFBR also agreed to co-operate with US-based Terrapower on sodium fast reactor technology.",
            "Currently Japan's basic policy of promoting the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reducing the volume and hazard level of highly radioactive waste, effective use of energy resources, and energy self-reliance. MHI said that, going forward, together with MFBR, it “will apply its technologies and experience as it begins the demonstration reactor's conceptual design and its requisite R&D, for the realisation of a fast reactor.”",

Currently ŠKODA JS has delivered 20 and another six are expected this year, according to Temelín NPP Director Jan Krumlov. From 2029, ŠKODA JS will supply Temelín from two to six containers a year. “These will be the same containers as the existing ones, dual-purpose containers. It will be possible to both transport and store the fuel used in them. They will differ only in technical details,” said ŠKODA JS CEO František Krček. Before using the new containers, ŠKODA JS must obtain approval from the State Office for Nuclear Safety.",

            "The Government of Canada said domestic production of medical isotopes will position Canada to take advantage of the growing global market for medical isotopes, which is expected to reach up to $31bn by 2031. Globally, more than 40m procedures use this technology each year.",
            "Demand for medical isotopes worldwide is increasing, and the investment aims to ensure that Canada has access to a steady supply. CMIE will encourage the domestic production of medical isotopes, advance Canadian expertise on medical isotopes and make Canada an attractive hub for investment in the medical isotopes sector.",
            "CMIE will also help to fund new tools and therapies and is expected to attract over CAD75m in investments, create or maintain over 600 highly skilled jobs for Canadians, and create 30 internship opportunities.",
            "As part of the funding, the Saugeen Ojibway Nation (SON) will take the next step in their partnership with Bruce Power to jointly produce, advance and market new isotopes in support of the global fight against cancer, marking a significant contribution to economic reconciliation within the SON territory.",
            "François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science & Industry said the pandemic had shown the importance of having a strong domestic production of pharmaceuticals. “With this investment, we are making our country a major player in the global biomanufacturing and life sciences industry while creating good jobs for Canadians and stimulating the local economy.”",
            "CPDC CEO Owen Roberts said: “Canada has held an extraordinary global leadership position in the production and medical use of isotopes for several decades. With the support of the Government of Canada; our co-lead, TRIUMF Innovation; and all our network partners, the new Canadian Medical Isotope Ecosystem has the opportunity to accelerate the use of medical isotopes both here in Canada and globally.” TRIUMF CEO for Innovations Kathryn Hayashi said CMIE brings together government, industry and academia “to work collaboratively to build Canadian medical isotope capabilities and ensure Canada remains a leader in this high-growth sector”.",
            "Bruce Power President and CEO Mike Rencheck said Bruce Power “is proud to be among the innovative companies that places Canada at the forefront of nuclear medicine”. He added: “We are honoured to partner with the Saugeen Ojibway Nation to market isotope production, and we thank the federal government for its support in leveraging this historic opportunity while creating sustainable economic benefits within the SON territory.”",
            "Bruce Power partnered with the SON in 2019 to market current and new isotopes produced through the first-of-a-kind Isotope Production System (IPS) that was installed at Bruce Power in 2022. The partnership, named Gamzook’aamin aakoziwin (We are Teaming Up to Fight the Sickness) includes a revenue-sharing programme that provides a direct benefit to the community.",
            "“Today marks another important milestone in the Gamzook’aamin Aakoziwin partnership between Bruce Power and the Saugeen Ojibway Nation,” said Chief Veronica Smith of the Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation. “By working together, patients around the world have access to cancer-fighting treatments made possible through medical isotope production.” Chief Conrad Ritchie, Chippewas of Saugeen First Nation, said: “We are proud to be part of this innovative project, which will deliver benefits beyond the local community, to people across the world in the global fight against cancer.”",
            "The Made-in-Ontario IPS, designed and installed by Isogen (a joint venture between Framatome and Kinectrics) at Bruce Power, irradiates ytterbium-176 to produce lutetium-177, which is then transported to ITM’s manufacturing facility in Germany for processing of pharmaceutical-grade, non-carrier-added lutetium-177 (n.c.a. lutetium-177) and used in various clinical and commercial radiopharmaceutical cancer treatments.",

        "text": [
            "France’s Atomic Energy Commission (CEA – Commissariat à l'énergie Atomique et aux énergies Alternatives) is to conduct two feasibility studies on nuclear propulsion in space for the European Space Agency (ESA). CEA says these “could bring significant benefits, responding to Europe's concern to ensure long-duration missions in space”. CEA is therefore undertaking two studies – the Alumni project and RocketRoll. These one-year feasibility studies, will be used to develop a roadmap for the possible development of technological bricks and a demonstrator by 2035.",
            "The Alumni project, led by the CEA with the support of Ariane Group and Framatome, concerns a nuclear-thermal propulsion engine. It involves heating liquid hydrogen by passing it through a nuclear reactor core to transform it into gas at a high temperature, before ejecting it to generate thrust. This would have two to three times greater efficiency than a conventional chemical engine.",
            "This would thus make it possible to cut the time required for a journey to Mars and reduced exposure to intense space radiation. In the event of inhabited exploration of Mars, it would also facilitate delivery of the large equipment needed for survival.",
            "The RocketRoll project aims to study the feasibility of an electric nuclear propulsion system in which electricity is produced by a reactor to power electric ion thrusters. This involves ionising a gas and accelerating the ions produced, which are then ejected to generate thrust. This study will be carried by a consortium including CEA.",
            "Compared with conventional ion propulsion systems, where electricity is produced by solar panels, the engines would offer higher thrust, independent of exposure to sunlight. The use of this propulsion is envisaged, in particular beyond Mars, in the external solar system.",
            "Xavier Averty, programme manager at the CEA says, in addition to its work on technological advances for space (energy, sensors, chips, communication systems), CEA has been involved in studies on space nuclear power since the 1980s. “We have recognised know-how in the sizing and design of nuclear and fuel reactors, radiation protection and safety studies, and are already involved in radioisotope generator projects to produce heat and electricity to power space probes and rovers”.",

            "Belgian engineering firm Tractebel (part of French energy company Engie) has signed a Framework Cooperation Agreement with France’s Nuward and EDF to strengthen and extend collaboration in the development of the Nuward small modular reactor (SMR) technology. For over 50 years, Tractebel nuclear experts have supported the EDF Group in designing and operating the French nuclear fleet and building reactors in France and abroad.",
            "Collaboration with EDF on the Nuward SMR project started in 2021. Tractebel contributed to the finalisation of the conceptual design phase and has worked on the nuclear island and the conventional part of the plant for the basic design phase. The partners have now decided to deepen and extend their collaboration going forward.",
            "In March 2023, EDF created its subsidiary Nuward and began the basic design phase of the Nuward SMR project. It resulted in a significant increase in the human resources required for the project.",
            "According to EDF's SMR roadmap, the phase involving the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years. A Design and Safety options file is scheduled to be submitted to the French Nuclear Safety Authority next month.",
            "The Nuward SMR, based on proven PWR technology, is a 340 MWe plant with two reactors of 170 MWe each. The Nuward company continues to work with its established partners – the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA – Commissariat à l'énergie Atomique et aux énergies Alternatives), TechnicAtome and Naval Group. It also co-operates with more recent partners – Framatome and Tractebel.",
            "Nuward’s workforce is expected to increase to about 150 in its core team by 2024, with more than 600 in total including partners' staff contributing to the project. Under the new agreement, Tractebel will allocate more resources to Nuward SMR in all the fields of nuclear engineering. Around 50 engineers from Tractebel are currently working on the Nuward SMR project. This number is expected to double in the coming years.",
            "Tractebel’s Chief Global Nuclear Officer, Denis Dumont, says Tractebel has been leading innovation in SMR development for the past five years. “We are convinced that this technology will play a key role in the energy transition in Europe and worldwide. The cooperation agreement with Nuward reinforces our commitment to the development of the first EU SMR technology. Tractebel brings a European and industrial perspective to Nuward. Our engineers have worked on projects in several European countries to investigate SMRs’ potential to decarbonize heavy industries and retrofit coal power plants. We can leverage this experience to extend the industrial applications of the Nuward SMR technology and support Nuward in its projects outside France.”",
            "Nuward Executive President Renaud Crassous says Tractebel is a key partner for Nuward, alongside the other partners. The competition for skilled workers has become fierce within the nuclear industry. Building a Europe-wide team for the Nuward SMR project is crucial to support our ambition in positioning Nuward SMR as the European benchmark for small modular reactors.”",

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company has signed a Front-End Engineering & Design (FEED) contract with Bulgaria’s Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild for a AP1000 reactor to be constructed at the Kozloduy NPP site. Westinghouse said work was starting to assess Bulgarian industry and existing infrastructure at the Kozloduy site for its potential to host an AP1000 reactor.",
            "In March Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild and Westinghouse signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a joint working group to plan deployment of the AP1000 reactor in Bulgaria. The working group is evaluating regulatory, licensing and design requirements and developing a streamlined execution path in support of Bulgaria’s energy strategy, according to Westinghouse. The FEED contract is the first step in delivering the AP1000 reactor project, the company added.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades. Bulgaria's parliament in January mandated the caretaker government to begin talks with the USA on a potential agreement for the construction of two additional reactors at the Kozloduy NPP (units 7&8) using Westinghouse AP1000 technology.",
            "Earlier, Bulgaria, which is under pressure to reduce its energy dependency on Russia, signed an agreement with France's Framatome to receive fresh nuclear fuel for unit 6 between 2025 and 2034 following a similar agreement with Westinghouse Electric in December for nuclear fuel for unit 5. Fuel is currently supplied by Russia’s TVEL. The documentation for the project and the change of fuel is still being considered in the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.",
            "Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild is a subsidiary of Kozloduy NPP set up as a project company specifically to manage a project to build one or two new units on the Kozloduy site. The aim is to use existing infrastructure and to benefit from the improved licensing and ecological status of the site. Studies have already been carried out only for a seventh unit at Kozloduy NPP, and an environmental assessment of the project has been undertaken. For unit 8, such procedures are still in the conceptual phase.",
            "“We are pleased to begin work to deliver the world’s most advanced, Generation III+ reactor technology to provide clean and reliable baseload energy for our customer and the people of Bulgaria,” said David Durham, Energy Systems President for Westinghouse. “We thank Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild and the Bulgarian Parliament for their confidence in our industry-leading, Nth of a kind technology. We commend Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild for their thoughtful approach to best-in-class project delivery that will ensure high localization of the work.”",
            "Currently, the AP1000 is not licensed or operating anywhere in Europe. In the USA two AP1000 reactors are under construction at the Vogle NPP in Georgia but are significantly delayed and over budget. Two Westinghouse AP1000 units are in operation at China’s Sanmen and Haiyang NPPs, and two CAP1000 units, the Chinese version of the AP1000, are being built as the second phase of each station. The proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at China’s Lufeng NPP was approved by the National Development & Reform Commission but has not yet received State Council approval. Westinghouse noted that three AP1000 units have recently been selected in Poland and nine others are planned in Ukraine.",
            "Energy minister Rossen Hristov in January set out an energy strategy for 2023 to 2053 for Bulgaria, which includes plans for two new reactors at Kozloduy and two at Belene where a project to construct two VVER-1000 units has been suspended.",
            "The Belene project in northern Bulgaria was to comprise two Russian VVER-1000 reactors, and initial site works began in 2008 when the BSP was in power. Contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers, but the project faced financial problems and loss of political support when the BSP was voted out in 2009. The project was suspended in 2012. In 2019, the government advertised for a strategic investor for a project to build two large reactors, but said that neither funding guarantees nor long-term electricity sales contracts would be offered. Bulgaria had to pay compensation to Rosatom for the two reactors which had already been manufactured and delivered.",
            "In January 2021 the Bulgarian government approved plans for Kozloduy 7, and held talks with Westinghouse about making maximum use of the Russian-supplied equipment already purchased for Belene. However, after lengthy and complex negotiations, the AP-1000 technology was deemed the most suitable, according to the decision published on the parliament's website.",

            "Framatome has signed contracts with power utility Vattenfall for the modernisation of Sweden’s Ringhals NPP. Framatome will update reactor control systems using its digital instrumentation & control (I&C) TELEPERM XS platform and refurbish the reactor coolant pumps for units 3&4.",
            "The work also includes upgrade of the KSU Simulator at Ringhals. The equipment will be jointly tested with Vattenfall at KSU Simulator premises before it is installed. The new reactor control system will be installed and commissioned in 2026 for unit 3 and in 2027 for unit 4.",
            "In addition, Framatome will refurbish six reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) within the primary loop. Framatome has manufactured, maintained and repaired these components for decades from its Jeumont and Maubeuge industrial facilities in northern France.",
            "The RCP internals and motors will be transported to Maubeuge, where they will be inspected and refurbished, including the installation of new stators and the replacement of thermal barrier covers. They will then be shipped back to Sweden to gradually replace the current operating equipment between 2025 and 2031.",
            "Framatome CEO Bernard Fontana said the agreement “is a step forward in strengthening our long-standing relationship with Vattenfall and our commitment to support the continued operations of safe, economical, reliable and low carbon electricity generation at Ringhals”.",
            "The 1062 MWe Ringhals 3 and 1117 MWe Ringhals 4 are pressurised water reactors (PWRs) were commissioned in 1981 and 1983. Vattenfall is planning to extend operation of both units for a total operational lifetime of 60 years each. Ringhals 1&2 are undergoing decommissioning. The Ringhals 2 PWR was closed in December 2019 followed by the Ringhals 1 boiling water reactor in December 2020.",

        "title": "Hungary confirms no changes in Paks II contract",
        "text": [
            "Hungarian Foreign Affairs & Trade Minister Péter Szijjártó has confirmed that the modifications made to the contract for construction of the Paks II NPP in April represent only minor technical changes. He told a press conference that “In both the financing and construction contracts, we agreed with the Russian partner [Rosatom] on amendments to Paks II. These related to the structure of the investment and the executor but left the project company untouched.”",
            "He added that the minor contract changes were dictated by the passage of time. “Nine years have passed since the contract was signed, and a lot has changed since then. Technical changes are being made to speed things up,” he said.",
            "He also noted that the EU is not expected not to hinder the amendment of the contract in this regard, as it also complies with EU rules and security regulations in all respects. He said the European Commission will have an easy task and will be able to authorise Paks II quickly with the contract amendments.",
            "The Paks II project was launched in 2014 by an inter-governmental agreement between Hungary and Russia for two VVER-1200 reactors (units 5&6) to be supplied by Rosatom. The contract was supported by a Russian state loan to finance the majority of the project. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority issued the licence for the units in August 2022. In December, the Hungarian parliament approved the extension of the life of the four existing VVER-440 power units at the Paks NPP for another 20 years. The current life of the station's nuclear reactors would have ended in 2032-2037, and now it is assumed that they will work until at least 2052-2057. Paks currently provides half of all generated and one third of the consumed electricity in Hungary.",
            "In a speech to the Ernst & Young International Consulting Company he noted: “Everyone seems to be trying to place the obstacles on the road to building the Paks nuclear plant. Although there are no nuclear sanctions yet, the German government has made it virtually impossible for Siemens to honour a contract it has concluded with Rosatom [for equipment].” He noted that negotiations are under way with Framatome to supply the needed components.",
            "Earlier, following a European Union (EU) ministerial meeting in Brussels, he told journalists that Hungary will not allow the EU to impose sanctions on the Russian nuclear energy industry. Although",
            "Budapest is facing tremendous pressure over the issue, this will not affect its position, he said. “Here and now, I would like to state again that this will definitely not happen. Hungary will not [agree] to nuclear [industry] sanctions of any kind, even minimal ones.” He noted that the Paks NPP is crucial to Hungary’s energy security and Budapest will block any initiative to restrict cooperation with Russia regarding nuclear energy.",
            "Restrictions on Russia’s nuclear sector are being considered as part of the EU’s 11th sanctions package, which is currently being drawn up. Szijjártó added that other EU members that use nuclear energy also oppose the idea. Hungary blocked a similar initiative in February, when the EU adopted its 10th sanctions package. “If there is a proposal to the sanction the nuclear industry, we will consider it an anti-Hungarian proposal and will veto it,” he stressed.",
            "He told a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference that “Hungarian foreign policy will remain Hungarian foreign policy. Decisions will continue to be made in Budapest and in the future they will serve only national interests.” He noted that nine EU member states had formed a group with the declared aim of removing the current need for EU decision to be made unanimously. He said the government would oppose any policy aimed at destroying sovereign, national foreign policy such as the removal of the unanimity requirement from the EU’s foreign policy decision-making.",

        "text": [
            "Bruce Power says it has achieved a major milestone of \"substantial completion\" of the construction phase of Major Component Replacement (MCR) portion of refurbishment of unit 6 at the Bruce nuclear plant. Refuelling will now begin with the aim of returning the plant to service later this year.",
            "The MCR project began in January 2020. The eight pressurised heavy-water Candu reactor units at the Bruce site in Ontario (Bruce A – units 1-4, and Bruce B – units 4-8) began commercial operation between 1977 and 1987. Bruce Power’s CAD13bn ($10bn) Life Extension Programme, which includes Asset Management and MCR, began in 2016. MCR, which began with unit 6 and also includes units 3-8, will extend the life of the site until 2064. Units 1&2 have already been refurbished and were returned to service in 2012. Work began on unit 3 in March.",
            "Unit 6 is the first of six reactors at the site to undergo refurbishment as part of a privately funded investment to extend the life of the site to 2064. The unit was taken offline for the refurbishment in January 2020 at the start of the COVID pandemic, which presented a \"major hurdle\" to Bruce Power and its construction partners. However, the substantial completion of the construction phase has been completed on time and on budget, Bruce Power said.",
            "Bruce Power Operations staff will now begin refuelling the unit with 5,760 fuel bundles in May, while other lead-out activities and regulatory inspections will be completed to return it to Ontario’s electricity grid in the fourth quarter of this year.",
            "“Nuclear energy is crucial to powering our growing province and thriving economy and the completion of construction on Bruce Power’s unit 6 Major Component Replacement Project is a critical step as we ensure the province can meet the demand for clean, low-cost electricity,” said Minster of Energy Todd Smith. “Our strong nuclear industry has enabled one of the cleanest electricity systems in the world and, as a leader in nuclear refurbishment, we’re ensuring this carries forward for the people, businesses and hospitals in Ontario.”",
            "Bruce Power’s construction partners in the project included Aecon, United Engineers & Constructors, SNC-Lavalin, BWXT, ES Fox, ATS, Black and MacDonald, Makwa Cahill, Highland Nuclear, SGT, Framatome, Kinectrics and subvendors. Work is now progressing on unit 3 with bulkhead installation and the Primary Heat Transport system ‘drain and dry’ as the next steps prior to starting construction activity, which begins with major component disassembly later this quarter. Bruce Power says each successive outage over the next decade will build off the successes and innovations of the unit 6 MCR.",
            "The construction phase of the unit 6 MCR was completed with execution partner Shoreline Power Group “and a multitude of talented and dedicated tradespeople from the Ontario Building Trades”. It included removal and replacement of 960 feeder tubes, 480 fuel channels, and 480 calandria tubes. Steam generator work was completed earlier this year by SGRT a 50/50 joint venture between Aecon and SGT (a partnership between Framatome and United Engineers & Constructors).",
            "Shoreline Power Group, a joint venture between Aecon, SNC-Lavalin and United Engineers & Constructors, executed the fuel channel and feeder replacement work on Unit 6 and will continue with the remaining MCR units.",
            "Bruce Power’s Life Extension Programme and MCR Project will extend the operational life of each reactor by 30-35 years. Bruce Power’s MCR and Asset Management investments will be closely coordinated with Project 2030, a programme that leverages innovation and new efficient technology to increase site capacity, targeting more than 7,000 MW net peak output in the early 2030s, once all units have completed their MCRs. It will also ensure a steady supply of medical isotopes for the world market for decades to come. Bruce Power’s Life-Extension Programme will directly and indirectly support 22,000 jobs annually and inject CAD4bn ($2.99bn) into the province’s economy. Bruce Power, established in 2001, is a Canadian-owned partnership of TC Energy, OMERS, the Power Workers’ Union and The Society of United Professionals.",

            "Indústrias Nucleares do Brasil (INB) has signed four contracts and two agreements during the opening of the Nuclear Trade & Technology Exchange (NT2E). The biennial nuclear sector business and technology fair, promoted by the Brazilian Association for the Development of Nuclear Activities (ABDAN) is the biggest nuclear event in Latin America. It attracted many leading companies such as as Framatome, Rosatom, Westinghouse, Holtec, ENBPar, Eletronuclear, Amazul, Andrade Gutierrez, Nuclep, BNDES and Sebrae.",
            "INB signed three contracts with Westinghouse. Under one, Westinghouse will hire INB to supply specialised labour for handling fuel in the USA. Under the other two, INB contracted Westinghouse for the supply of metallic components and gadolinium rods for Angra 1 reloads and for development of a project for the component “protective grade” for fuel elements.",
            "INB also signed two agreements with Brazil’s Institute for Energy & Nuclear Research (IPEN) for a research partnership, and development of studies and technologies related to the production of fuel elements.",
            "A contract was also signed with Rosatom/Tenex, for the supply of natural UF6 (uranium hexafluoride). It follows a tender won last year for the supply of 330 tonnes of UF6 to Brazil. Rosatom Deputy Director General Kirill Komarov said: \"We continue to develop cooperation with the Brazilian company INB on the supply of uranium products. Last year, we won an international tender and signed a contract for the supply of uranium enrichment services. Another contract for the supply of natural uranium was signed in Rio de Janeiro today. \"",
            "During the opening of the event, ABDAN President Celso Cunha, stated that Brazil has an important mission: to convince the government that the country can become one of the world's biggest players in the nuclear sector. Brazil has the sixth largest uranium reserve in the world, already produces nuclear fuel and has the capacity to expand this production, he said.",
            "Cunha pointed out that under its 10-year energy plan, Brazil envisages the construction of a new 1,000 MWe NPP in addition to the completion of unit 3 at the Angra NPP. He added that nuclear technology also plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially in the fight against cancer. highlighted the relevance of this technology for public health and the advancement of medicine in Brazil.",
            "Kirill Komarov pointed out the role of state support for nuclear projects: “There are several world leaders in the construction of nuclear power plants including China, India, Russia and some countries of the Arab world. The governments of all these countries provide considerable support to nuclear projects while also directly participating in their implementation. Nuclear energy development is certainly impossible without government support.”",

        "text": [
            "France’s Framatome has announced a key advance in development of monolithic molybdenum-uranium (U-Mo) fuel for Germany’s Forschungsreaktor München II (FRM II) research reactor, operated by the Technical University of Munich (TUM).",
            "Framatome’s CERCA Research & Innovation Laboratory (CRIL) and TUM developed the main component of a high-quality U-Mo fuel in record time and within budget. They also manufactured the prototype, established a qualification procedure, and installed a pilot line for the fuel. Framatome said this is “Europe’s low-enriched fuel with the highest density ever realised for research reactor operations”. It represents a key contribution to the continued operation of FRM II which provides neutrons to industry and the scientific community.",
            "“Producing innovations for safe and reliable operations of research reactors is at the heart of what we do every day,” said CERCA vice president François Gauché. “Developing this sophisticated fuel while creating knowledge useful for future manufacturing was a significant challenge. We are proud of our CERCA team for providing a solution that meets the customer’s objectives and will ensure the continuation of its scientific activities.”",
            "FRM II currently uses highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel to generate a dense neutron flux for scientific experiments and the production of medical radioisotopes. Several years ago, TUM launched a programme to explore the feasibility of a fuel based on low-enriched uranium (LEU) while maintaining good performance of the reactor. In 2019, the university contracted Framatome to develop the U-Mo foils manufacturing technique to support the existing technology of embedded foils in a cladding of aluminium.",
            "Framatome’s U-Mo fuel allows the reactor to maintain its high level of performance with LEU as a result of its high uranium density. The first U-Mo foils were recently manufactured at CERCA using high quality uranium material. Irradiation of the first monolithic U-Mo fuel plate prototype is scheduled for September 2023.",
            "FRM II is a world leading research reactor and neutron source. It is optimised for neutron scattering experiments at beam tubes and neutron guides. It has irradiation facilities that produce homogenously doped silicon for the renewable energy transition, and radioisotopes needed for medical diagnostics and cancer treatments.",
            "However, the reactor is currently not in service operation. After a micro-leakage in the central channel the production of a replacement part is ongoing. “The procurement of a highly complex individual piece of the highest nuclear requirements requires special care and is being carried out with intensive assessment by the expert appointed by the nuclear regulatory authority,” said FRM II Technical Director Dr Axel Pichlmaier. He added that operation is expected to resume in 2024.",
            "Meanwhile, TUM said German politicians support the conversion to LEU fuel. “The responsible Bavarian State Ministry for Science & Art gave its approval to this plan,” TUM said. “This was preceded by successful research at TUM on the theoretical possibility of retrofitting. Preparations for the approval process for the new fuel can now begin.”",
            "Science Minister Markus Blume said: “We want to operate Germany's most powerful research reactor in the future with the most advanced low-enriched fuel – with the same performance as before. In this way, we will secure neutron research at the Bavarian science site, which is elementary for so many future fields, and invest in the further development of fuels. It is clear to us that research strength and open technology without ideological blinkers are prerequisites for a good and secure future.”",
            "TUM President Professor Thomas F Hofmann welcomed the positive reaction from politicians. “The research reactor is an alternative tool for science. With the neutrons generated there, for example, batteries or the materials for high-performance gas turbines can be examined without destruction. The system is also used for the production of cancer drugs and was even involved in the research of mRNA vaccines.”",
            "Plans have been approved for fuel with a maximum of 50% uranium-235 enrichment “as soon as the new fuel is developed, is qualified and industrially available”. However, complex computer simulations and calculations have shown that uranium-235 can be enriched by less than 20% if monolithic uranium-molybdenum is used as fuel.",
            "TUM says the task now is to put the theory, which has been confirmed by independent teams of experts, into practice. For this purpose, a cross-departmental project team at FRM II will carry out further optimisations in the fuel element design in the next few years and prepare the initiation of the approval process and the procurement of new fuel elements",
            "The calculations were carried out by researchers from TUM and the US Argonne National Laboratory while Framatome is developing fuel production. Research at the TUM Centre for Nuclear Safety & Innovation was funded by the Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) and the Bavarian State Ministry for Science & the Arts (StMWK).",

            "France’s Framatome has received US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval allowing it to apply its suite of Advanced Codes & Methods to operating conditions with uranium-235 enrichments above the industry standard of 5 weight percent (wt%). This is critical for Framatome’s goal of reload readiness by 2027 of nuclear fuel with higher uranium enrichments and burnups in the current light water reactor fleet.",
            "This will support Framatome’s advanced fuel development efforts aimed at improving fuel utilisation for nuclear plant operators and systematic improvements for safety and plant economics. “Our codes and methods provide added flexibility and allow nuclear plant operators to extend operating cycles and energy output,” said Lionel Gaiffe, Senior Executive Vice President for Framatome’s Fuel Business Unit.",
            "Framatome says its advanced codes and methods provide significant operational margin gains. These give nuclear plant operators the flexibility to extend their reactor performance when coupled with the company’s nuclear fuel technology and its higher enrichment and burnup characteristics.",
            "This regulatory approval also demonstrates that Framatome can effectively model reactor behaviour in the evaluation of neutronic, thermal hydraulic, small- and large-break loss-of-coolant-accident (LOCA), non-LOCA safety analysis, as well as for thermal mechanical performance with fuel enriched above current limits.",
            "Earlier, NRC also approved a licence amendment allowing Framatome’s shipping containers to transport fresh nuclear fuel assemblies in the US with U-235 enrichments up to 8 wt%. The NRC also approved the methodology used to demonstrate that Framatome’s fuel fabrication facility will retain current safety margins when higher enriched material is received and processed into fuel. Based on this approval, major equipment orders have been placed to support the system upgrades needed to process higher enrichments, Framatome said.",
            "The advanced fuel technology is being developed at Framatome facilities worldwide and will be built at the Richland, Washington, nuclear fuel manufacturing facility, which received the first 40-year fuel fabrication operating license approval, which extended its licence to 2049."

            "Supply chain is most robust in those countries that also have a significant live nuclear fleet based on incumbent nuclear designs like the US, France, Russia, South Korea and China. (Credit: Kurt Klement from Pixabay)",
            "Sustaining supply chains for a business that is characterised by strong safety regulation, very long lead times and dramatic fluctuations in cycles of activity is an issue for some countries. For the nuclear sector this is particularly the case for key components like large forgings and castings but also smaller, level three supply chain items like switches and valves. The nuclear sector also has unique features such as strong quality assurance requirements, and corresponding materials certification requirements.",
            "Almost by definition, the supply chain is most robust in those countries that also have a significant live nuclear fleet based on incumbent nuclear designs like the US, France, Russia, South Korea and China. This is reinforced where that is in combination with new build plans as well as government policy that drives and supports the industry.",
            "“When we talk about the supply chain, that means countries like China, Korea or the US have to a lesser extent challenges, while European countries like Switzerland, Sweden and even the UK, do have their challenges,” Michael Kruse, Managing Partner and Global Leader Energy in the Utilities Practice of Arthur D. Little Schweiz AG, tells",
            "There are also spill over effects, especially across the second and third tier suppliers of specialised components and equipment that they are delivering into the supply chain. “The reason is that when there is not a repetitive business, then the capabilities of companies will shrink and diminish,” says Kruse. However, while the industry – bar a few hotspots here and there – has largely been in a position of managed decline for decades that landscape has radically changed in the last few years and supply chain challenges must now be addressed if the sector is to meet new and reinvigorated market demands.",
            "“There is no global answer to address all these challenges and businesses need to think on a more regional perspective,” says Kruse, adding: “It is a significant issue in Western Europe, as well as to an increasing extent in Eastern Europe, especially at those plants that are operating Russian technology, because this will also lead to increasing supply chain issues due to the geopolitical situation. The most severe supply chain issues are related to Europe and possibly countries that are closely tied to European technology, like South Africa. Conversely, in countries like the US, China and Japan there is a strong and large nuclear fleet and a domestic market in general.",
            "Supply chains don’t just concern physical components though. Another critical element for the nuclear sector concerns the skilled and experienced people that are needed for development to take place. While there are regional variations at play, the recruitment and human capital development issue is significantly more widespread. This is currently a big issue in the UAE and Turkey, for example, as well as Saudi Arabia, which plans to start building soon.",
            "“I think this is a general issue in most countries, excluding China, Russia and also countries like India which are all special cases. But in regard to Western countries, the ageing of staff at the operator end, as well as at the supplier end, creates a significant challenge. Entities are struggling with these capabilities due to ageing and lack of young professionals entering the industry. Losing experienced workforce also means they are losing the capabilities needed to oversee the product that’s going to be produced, permitted, and then installed in the plant. One of the key issues is that 80% of the effort is documentation-related and companies need to understand how to do the technical documentation, the licensing and permitting-related documentation for equipment and components,” Kruse explains. He adds: It’s a linked process. You cannot isolate the operator side from the supplier side because the operator has an oversight responsibility. It also needs to their contribution to the supply chain, in regard to requirements management, configuration, documentation, licensing and quality assurance. This is a significant challenge in many countries right now, “not speaking about the challenges with certified craftsmen like welders and radiation protection labour”, Kruse adds.",
            "It’s clear that in order to overcome this issue requires education programmes and also effective marketing to make the industry more attractive as an employment opportunity due to the energy transition. Developments like SMR and fusion do have an air of excitement that might go some way to making the nuclear sector more attractive to the young, brilliant engineers needed but there is stiff competition. “There is loss of people, especially the younger workforce from the oil and gas sector or the nuclear sector into the renewable sector. It’s technicians but also the academic workforce working elsewhere and that creates workforce challenges,” Kruse says.",
            "Digital tooling to support management and training as part of a knowledge transfer programme is emerging as part of the solution, but Kruse argues that it is not a complete answer. “People are pinning their hopes on digital tools that are emerging like building information modelling and configuration management tools which link into the requirements management. However, in the end there are always three dimensions that need to be considered in a supply chain. You have the human element, you have the technology element, and you have the organisation element. That cannot all be solved just by digital tools. Interfaces need to be managed, they need to be human and need to take decisions. Nuclear oversight needs to be done by someone and both the operator and the supplier need to have these capabilities. That will always require humans so they cannot be fully replaced,” he says.",
            "Nonetheless, digital tools can make some supply chain issues easier, such as engineering of components, ageing management of operating plants and exchanging g requirements between regulators, owners, and suppliers. “This is a big issue, ensuring the equipment is being manufactured and installed in a conformant way and doesn’t create any non-conformities, which lead to cost overruns and risk energy availability of the plant,” notes Kruse.",
            "Developing a suitable regulatory regime",
            "Another related supply chain challenge is the licensing and regulatory processes that are in place. Kruse cites SMRs as an example: “One of the main barriers to SMR development is international standards determination with regard to licensing and product standardisation. SMRs require a standard supply chain, which leads to economies of scale and learning curve effects that will bring down the cost. That is needed to make the levelised cost of energy competitive against renewables and this is only possible if the licensing of SMRs is similar to aviation, for example. When you license an aircraft in the US, by the US authorities, it’s also accepted by the European authorities. For nuclear, that is not the case. It’s country-specific licensing and though there are a lot of efforts underway to make that process more harmonised it’s not really progressing satisfactorily.”",
            "Kruse continues: “This will also affect the supply chain because economically viable SMRs require a standardised global supply chain. Today, nuclear new build often demands a significant local component. Countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Turkey mandate local content for example, and that means modification of an open supply chain which requires that the local workforce are appropriately educated and all the manufacturing is certified.”",
            "Considering other aspects of new build, another key supply chain issue is the loss of capability as the industry has fragmented. Suppliers from Western countries in particular do not have a strong integrated EPC capability like they used to when they were building multiple second generation plants.",
            "Kruse argues that companies like Framatome, Westinghouse and Siemens had far stronger vertically integrated supply chains and could therefore manage the end-to-end supply chain in-house. “This capability doesn’t exist anymore among Western suppliers,” says Kruse. Conversely, Eastern suppliers, for example Rosatom, have a backwards vertically-integrated capability. “Their supply chain is capable of delivering locally but, irrespective from sanctions, is actually hardly able to deliver globally. This is because the local standards are often different from Western standards and then they need to either replace sub-suppliers, or they are internal sub suppliers and need to manufacture according to Western standards, like ASME and IEEE that they are not used to. Again, that’s strongly related to documentation requirements. If you link it also to the labour issue in Western countries then if the owner organisation is short of capable people, then they cannot manage the supplier and the supply chain sufficiently to avoid cost overruns and redundant work and reengineering efforts,” Kruse concludes.",
            "Light at the end of the tunnel?",
            "Improving the capabilities of the supply chain is a complex and multi-faceted challenge but Kruse believes there are positive actions that can be taken. He says: “I think one main requirement is to continue working on international harmonisation and standardisation of licensing and permitting. That’s one key element. Secondly, I think that some existing plants need to get",
            "the ‘as built’ documentation, as well as the modification documentation in place and digitised so they have a proper component inventory and the needed master data for every component available. That will allow them to become more independent and knowledgeable about what they have really built into the plant as components.”",
            "Kruse says that new plants tend to already have this kind of information available in a digital format as regulators nowadays have quite strict configuration management requirements asking the owner and the supplier to have a digital model of the plant, including all digital information available on the installed equipment and components. Older plants don’t all have that and there are even still a significant number of components which are not properly documented. “Often only the supplier who has been servicing the plant has the knowledge about that and this means that there is a risk for the operator by not having sufficient intelligence if the supplier is not available anymore, or if they want to have a dual source strategy,” explains Kruse, adding: “That technical database is a prerequisite to build a more robust supply chain, to understand where operators do have obsolescence of materials, or where materials and suppliers are at risk. That kind of classification is the groundwork that is needed.”",
            "This information needs to be available to operators to build a resilient supply chain if alternative suppliers are to be sourced and are to be able to meet the replacement requirements for those components. “In Western Europe many operators have not done this homework yet and I would also suppose this is the case in the US even though the US has a larger fleet. Where those vulnerabilities exist, the risks to component supply chains are necessarily higher whereas in a bigger, more robust market that’s less likely to happen, although not impossible,” notes Kruse.",
            "In Western Europe, many operators are concerned about the capability of the supply chain and suppliers of critical components leaving the market, or losing the required capabilities that means they can deliver on time, at the right cost and quality. That puts the economics of the plant at risk.",
            "The nuclear supply chain is also complex. There is the supply chain for new build, then for operations and another for decommissioning. There are international and quite local components in that supply chain. “There’s market design, policy and all sorts of other things that go into that but if you can’t build and maintain it at a reasonable cost, you’re nowhere. The common denominator is the question of technical and licensing and safety-related standards and the availability of knowledgeable people who can deal with the requirements engineering well,” says Kruse. He concludes: “The levelised cost of energy needs to be competitive against renewables that only have a very low marginal cost. This is the biggest challenge for nuclear power plants and the supply chain has to play a quite important role to deliver that promise of safe and cheap energy. There is simply no one gold bullet to fix it.”"

        "text": [
            "Urenco has agreed to supply enrichment services to the Kozloduy NPP in Bulgaria. Urenco has become part of a supply chain which includes fuel partners Canada’s Cameco, UK-based Uranium Asset Management (UAM) and US-based Westinghouse. Cameco has signed a 10-year supply contract with Westinghouse to provide sufficient volumes of natural uranium hexafluoride (UF6 – including uranium and conversion services), to support unit 5 at Kozloduy. Urenco’s enrichment facilities in Europe (the UK, the Netherlands and Germany) will use the UF6 from Cameco to supply enriched uranium product (EUP) for fabrication into nuclear fuel rods by Westinghouse. The EUP will be delivered to Westinghouse’s facility at Vasteras in Sweden, which will fabricate fuel for Kozloduy.",
            "Kozloduy NPP on the Danube River currently uses fuel supplied by Rosatom’s Tvel for its two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Units 1-4 with VVER-440 reactors were closed as a condition for Bulgaria’s accession to the EU, despite being extensively upgraded, drastically reducing Bulgaria’s energy export. Under ppressure from the EU, Bulgaria is now seeking to diversify its fuel supplies away from Russia. Earlier this year. Kozloduy NPP signed a 10-year agreement with France’s Framatome to supply nuclear fuel to Kozloduy's unit 5 from early 2025. Kozloduy had previously signed a similar contract with Westinghouse Electric Sweden for nuclear fuel for unit 6 from 2024. Bulgaria's current contract with Tvel expires in at the end of 2025.",
            "Urenco CEO Boris Schucht, along with representatives from Cameco, UAM and Westinghouse, visited Sofia to mark the new agreement and the first order from Kozloduy. Boris said, “Urenco is ready to support countries seeking to increase their energy security and independence and I am pleased to welcome Kozloduy as our newest customer.",
            "“This is Cameco’s first agreement to supply fuel for Bulgaria’s nuclear energy sector,” said Cameco’s President & CEO Tim Gitzel. “We are very pleased to add another market to Cameco’s global commercial portfolio and to expand our contributions to countries like Bulgaria that are seeking to enhance their energy security while affirming their commitment to carbon-free nuclear power in achieving their climate goals.”",
            "The agreement, which runs to 2033, will see Cameco deliver a total of approximately 2.2m KgU as UF6 (the equivalent of about 5.7m pounds of uranium concentrate – U3O8).",

        "text": [
            "Over the year, nuclear power output in France totalled 279 TWh in 2022. (Credit: Leopictures from Pixabay)",
            "In 2021 energy customers saw their bills mount, as sanctions on Russia, including a halt on its oil and gas exports across Europe, coincided with other factors to drive up power prices. The burden did not fall equally on consumers: some business and domestic customers were able to take advantage of options such as onsite generation or long-term contracts on favourable terms. It also did not fall equally on the energy sector. Upstream energy companies benefitted from the rise in gas prices, as customers and traders sought to secure cargoes from sources other than Russia, whether that was to fuel gas- fired power stations, heat homes and businesses, or fill storage capacity.",
            "Some energy utilities with retail and domestic customers saw their rates capped by governments who needed to ensure both user groups could buy the power they needed, meaning the utilities relied on government to make up the shortfall. While some electricity generators without input costs, such as wind generators, were able to benefit from the high market prices, gas users saw their fuel costs rise dramatically.",
            "The hardest hit were utilities who had to go to the market to fulfil electricity supply contracts. In years of low wind that burden might have been on renewable energy generators. In 2022, the impact was hardest on Europe’s key nuclear generator, EDF.",
            "The company struggled for most of the year with unplanned outages across its fleet as it tried to remedy stress corrosion cracking. At the start of December it still had five nuclear reactors (5.3 GW in total) out of service until the end of the 2022 and it later delayed those restarts until February (Flamanville 1) and March (Penly 1).",
            "Over the year, nuclear power output in France totalled 279 TWh in 2022, which meant it was down 81.7TWh on 2021. EDF was also hit by low water levels, which reduced income from its hydropower business.",
            "The cost to the company was more than the loss of income from those shut down plants. EDF had no choice but to go to the market to replace the power it would have generated, and do it when prices were very high. Between January and September 2022, spot electricity prices averaged €297/MWh, compared with around €70/ MWh for the period in previous years. Overall, the financial impact took a €29.1bn toll on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda), although consumers responded to initiatives to lower consumption as well as relatively warm weather going into winter. Demand was 5.7 TWh lower than expected. Similarly, but at smaller scale, Ebitda was down 7.2% in Belgium (to €118m) because EDF Belgium had to buy power at high prices to compensate for low nuclear output.",
            "The loss of generation from EDF’s nuclear plants also hit its neighbouring countries. They are accustomed to rely on stable nuclear power volumes from France. But the EU’s regular report on European Energy Markets noted that in 2022 exports from France to Spain “practically disappeared”, while flows from Spain to France rose. In general, it said, French outages drove up electricity prices in France, “changing France’s traditional net exporter into a net importer role, not only from Spain but also from other Member States and the United Kingdom”. Flows between France and Belgium, Spain, Italy, Switzerland and Germany all saw a switch towards more power flowing into France more often. In Germany that was helped by the decision to allow the three remaining reactors (Isar 2, Neckarwestheim 2 and Emsland) to remain in operation until April 2023, to secure the security of supply during the winter season.",
            "There were two areas of EDF’s business that alleviated the negative impact of its nuclear outages. They were the exceptional performance of EDF Trading in a highly volatile market and better nuclear output in the UK.",
            "In 2022 EDF Trading increased its Ebitda to €6.407bn, up from €1.2bn the year before, “in a period of very high volatility across all commodity markets”.",
            "In the UK, nuclear output amounted to 43.6 TWh, a year-on-year increase of 1.9 TWh despite the shutdowns of Hunterston B in January and Hinkley Point B in August (both after 46 years of life). UK sales increased by 61.3% from €10.1bn to €16.1bn – a reverse of the situation in 2021, when EDF Energy had to buy power at the start of the rise in prices to compensate for low generation levels, resulting in a loss of €21m. The company credited good fleet availability and a lighter maintenance programme than in 2021.",
            "The market continues to reward flexibility, and that means companies like Centrica (see box) and Vattenfall, below, are increasing their investment in flexible assets. With Framatome in its portfolio, EDF has to take a lead on new nuclear construction.",
            "The company updated the market on the Flamanville project in December 2022, when it said the planned date for fuel loading had been delayed from Q2 2023 to Q1 2024 and the estimated cost had increased from €12.7bn to €13.2bn.",
            "The nuclear utility also highlighted two significant steps with its European neighbours. It has signed a Framework Cooperation Agreement for Nuclear New Build in Finland and Sweden with Fortum. It has submitted an initial bid to Czech operator ČEZ and its project company Elektrárna Dukovany for one EPR1200 reactor for the Dukovany site in the Czech Republic. It also recently reaffirmed its offer based on the EPR technology to support the ambitions of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme to deliver up to 9 GWe of nuclear output by 2043.",
            "Vattenfall looks to nuclear for long-term",
            "Another nuclear generator also saw a shift in its business in 2022. Vattenfall’s wind business (which also includes some solar) was almost as important for the company’s earnings as was its longstanding nuclear and hydropower segment. The nuclear portfolio decreased last year as its German nuclear plants closed for good and it too had ongoing maintenance issues to manage. But it also suffered because it was unable to gain from high power market prices because of lack of transmission capacity in Sweden.",
            "Vattenfall’s wind farms are offshore of Denmark and Sweden, as well as onshore in the UK. Wind generation from 3 GW of capacity at 50 wind farms rose slightly from 11.2 TWh in 2021 to 12.2 TWh, but Ebitda jumped from SEK13,451bn (€1.21bn) in 2021 to SEK22,508bn (€2bn) as a result of higher electricity prices on the Continent and new capacity coming online.",
            "Vattenfall’s nuclear and hydro business remained steady overall. Generation from nuclear power declined (-0.8 TWh), owing to lower availability caused by the delayed restart of Ringhals 4. The work on repairing the damaged pressure regulator at Ringhals 4 is ongoing “at high pace”, the company said and the reactor is planned to restart on 19 March. That outage was partly offset by Forsmark, which reached record levels of generation in 2022 with 25.5 TWh delivered.",
            "Overall, nuclear generation was 39.6 TWh, slightly down from 40.4 TWh the previous year, while hydro generation was 40.5 TWh, a shade down on 40.8 TWh in 2021. But in contrast to the high earnings from the wind business, Ebitda in nuclear and hydro fell from SEK40,312m (€36m) to SEK28,193m (€25m). The decrease is partly attributable to lower achieved electricity prices in the Nordic countries due to major price differences between price areas in Sweden. In recent years, the differences in electricity prices between the areas have grown wider as a result of bottlenecks in the transmission grid, which prevents the electricity from reaching southern regions.",
            "With its attractive return, it is no surprise that in the next few years Vattenfall is investing in wind, with a plan to quadruple its present capacity by 2030. Upcoming investment of SEK50bn (€4.5bn) will see the largest share, SEK38bn (€3.4bn), invested in wind power. Vattenfall will also invest in electricity grids and expansion of district heating operations. Other growth investments include charging infrastructure, solar and battery projects and heat energy solutions.",
            "The company is supportive of plans for new nuclear in Sweden but that is further ahead. It said, “We welcome the fact that the energy issue is given high priority on the public agenda and that nuclear power is once again viewed as a natural part of the Swedish energy mix. All fossil-free energy sources are needed, and we are looking forward to participating in bridging the existing gap between supply and demand in fossil-free energy.”",
            "New nuclear stake? Centrica is not persuaded",
            "As the UK government tries to interest third parties in investing in Sizewell C, it is worth considering the attitude of its existing third party nuclear investor, UK energy company Centrica.",
            "Centrica has undergone several changes of strategy this century as successive chief executives have tried to give more structure to its sprawling mix of activities, which stretch from gas exploration and production to retail sales as the British Gas brand. For much of this period the company tried to find a buyer for its 20% stake in the UK’s nuclear fleet. When the stake was acquired in 2009, then chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: “We believe nuclear energy is an essential component in ensuring clean, secure energy for the UK and we are proud to be part of our country’s nuclear renaissance.” His successor Iain Conn put the stake up for sale in 2018, saying he hoped to dispose of it within two years, but no buyer came forward.",
            "In 2021 Centrica gave up on the sale and last year it was rumoured that chief executive Chris O’Shea (still in post) might add to the company’s nuclear holdings by joining a consortium of owners of the planned plant at Sizewell C.",
            "The company’s latest results suggest that rumour was ill-founded: although the company current nuclear interest had a bumper year, it aims to use the cash – and earnings from the recent elevated gas prices – to invest in other areas in the energy transition.",
            "Nuclear paid off for Centrica in 2022. The year saw the end of generation at Hunterston B in January and Hinkley Point B in August, but improved plant reliability meant output was up",
            "slightly, up by 5% (from 8342 GWh to 8714 GWh). However the price achieved was up 200% year on year (from £46.6/MWh in 2021 to £140/MWh), and nuclear’s reported adjusted operating profit was £724m (€826m), compared with a loss of £38m (€43m) in 2021.",
            "The company should continue to see good returns for its nuclear sales from the remaining years of the AGR fleet (the units are due to close between 2024 and 2028) and Sizewell B. It has sold 5.0 TWh of nuclear electricity forward for 2023 at an average price of £203/MWh (€233/MWh) and 1.4 TWh forward for 2024 at an average price of £240/MWh (€274/MWh). It expects that prices will remain elevated and its large customers will see arrangements to hedge prices “rolling off”, so it expected to capture higher prices. Earnings will be affected by a government- imposed windfall tax (the so-called Electricity Generator Levy), which applies a 45% tax rate to revenues generated over £75/ MWh (€86/MWh) from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028. Currently the company pays a 34% tax on its nuclear earnings but it is taxed at 59% on its much larger gas business.",
            "With cash in hand from its gas and nuclear businesses the company is looking at investment in the future but currently it does not have new nuclear in its planning. Instead it is planning to leverage its experience in volatile markets, as it expects huge investment in intermittent renewable technologies such as wind and solar. The market rewards Centrica sees is the opportunity in battery storage, gas peaking generation, solar, hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS).",
            "Hinkley Point C faces cash shortfall",
            "There is a shortfall in funding the UK’s flagship nuclear power project, Hinkley Point C, EDF said in its 2022 results presentation.",
            "The project has been hit by rising inflation. In May last year the project completion cost was estimated to be in the range of £25bn to £26bn bn (€28.5–€29.7bn). But that is in 2015 terms, which brings it to £31-32bn (€35.4–€36.5bn) based on the inflation indexes available at end-2021. Based on inflation indexes as of",
            "30 June 2022, the estimated nominal cost at completion could reach £32.7bn (€37bn). In addition, the May 2022 review did not include the schedule and cost of electromechanical works and",
            "of final testing and EDF said in February at its annual results presentation that “the main civil and electromechanical works performance were less than expected in 2022. Mitigating actions to recover the impact of 3-6 months are underway.”",
            "Although the “start of electricity generation” for unit 1 is targeted for June 2027, EDF says there is a risk of further delay of the two units of 15 months.",
            "EDF said its agreements with CGN include a compensation mechanism between both shareholders in case of overrun of the initial budget or delays. This mechanism was triggered in January 2023. It said the project’s total financing needs now “exceed the contractual commitment of the shareholders”, and shareholders will be asked to provide additional equity, which will probably be needed in the second half of 2023. But EDF said, “The probability that CGN will not fund the project after it has reached its committed equity cap is high. In the event that CGN would not allocate voluntary equity, the EDF Group would be required to contribute in place of CGN.” CGN owns 33.5% of the project.",

            "During a visit to Moscow, Peter Szijjártó, Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs & Trade held lengthy talks with Deputy Premier Alexander Novak on general energy issues, and with Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev on the Paks-II NPP project.",
            "“The security of Hungary's energy supply requires uninterrupted gas transport, oil transports and nuclear fuel transports,” said Szijjártó on his Facebook page. “In order to fulfil these three conditions, Hungarian-Russian energy cooperation must be uninterrupted. This is not a matter of political preference, but a matter of physics.”",
            "Rosatom said the parties discussed further steps to implement the Paks-II NPP construction project, as well as other aspects of comprehensive cooperation in the nuclear sector. “Now, at the site of the future Paks-II station, preparatory work is underway to erect auxiliary buildings and structures. The process of obtaining licence documentation for certain types of work and equipment manufacturing is ongoing. The main licence for the construction of the Paks-II NPP was issued by the Hungarian regulator in August 2022.”",
            "Russia's nuclear sector has so far avoided EU sanctions because Rosatom still supplies fuel to reactors in several member countries, including Finland and Bulgaria. Hungary's Paks NPP comprising four Soviet-built VVER-440 reactors supplies some 40% of Hungary's electricity. These reactors use fuel supplied by Rosatom’s TVEL and Rosatom is also constructing two new VVER-1200 reactors (units 5&6) at Paks-II. The Paks-II project was launched in 2014 by an inter-governmental agreement between Hungary and Russia. The contract was supported by a Russian state loan to finance the majority of the project.",
            "In October 2021, Rusatom Automated Control Systems JSC (a subsidiary of Rosatom) and the Framatome-Siemens consortium signed an agreement for the manufacture of automated process control systems (APCS) for the two reactors. However, Germany has been blocking delivery of equipment. Szijjártó said in March that the Framatome-Siemens consortium had received an order for the manufacture and commissioning the APCS and that the French government had given Framatome permission to supply the technology. In Germany, however, Vice Chancellor, Minister for Economic Affairs & Climate Protection Robert Habek, as well as Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock were blocking Siemens participation. He said he would look to Framatome or Rosatom to provide the required equipment instead.",
            "During his trip to Moscow, he said agreement had been reached to amend the construction and financing contract for Paks-II. “Regardless of the war and the sanctions, life and the technological situation have changed so much that contracts had to be amended,” he said on Facebook. “We have gone through long negotiations, but today we have reached an agreement on all the necessary issues that guarantee that we can carry out the investment, protect Hungarian families' overhead reductions and the Hungarian economy from completely insane price changes.”",
            "He further said Brussels had realised that “there is no energy security and there is no European green transition without nuclear energy”. He added that Hungary was “well aware that a nuclear power plant is indispensable for affordable and safe energy”. He added: “We have to push for Paks-II to be built as soon as possible despite all kinds of difficulties, because the sooner the new units are built, the sooner we will be protected from the completely insane price movements of the international energy market.” In January, Hungary's Energy Minister Csaba Lantos said the Paks II plant was now expected to be completed in 2032."

        "title": "Swapping steam generators at Watts Bar",
        "text": [
            "Unit 2 of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar nuclear power plant returned to service last summer after replacing the reactor’s four steam generators. Although Watts Bar Unit 2 is America’s newest nuclear plant, construction actually began in 1972. It was suspended in 1985 having been about 55% complete when construction stopped. Work was resumed in 2007 and commercial operations at the 1165MWe Westinghouse PWR started in October 2016. A year earlier the NRC had approved a forty- year operating license for Unit 2, which is located on a 1700 acre (688 Ha) site on the northern end of Chickamauga Reservoir, near Spring City in Eastern Tennessee. Operated by TVA, Unit 2 was built at a construction cost of some $4.7 billion.",
            "Although unit 2 has only been operating for around six years, the existing steam generators had been installed during the earlier construction phase. “The steam generators were the original steam generators that were installed and not in use since the 1970s or early 1980s. They were laid up for that time so they were older steam generators,” explains Carol Barajas, vice president of the Watts Bar steam generator replacement project.",
            "“We expected them to last approximately 10 years and we knew we would have to replace them so when we started unit two back in 2016. We had ordered from Westinghouse the four new steam generators. They didn’t arrive on site until 2018,” Barajas adds. Westinghouse had supplied the original units also.",
            "The decision to replace the steam generators was based on the fact that they were an older design and used inferior alloys that are known to be susceptible to stress corrosion cracking and can therefore prematurely develop leaks and other problems.",
            "Indeed, unit 1 at Watts Bar had already had its steam generators replaced in the early 2000s with an upgraded version of the Westinghouse design using the new alloy 690 which is more robust and resistant to stress corrosion cracking.",
            "“Most of the industry in the United States have, for pressurized water reactors, replaced their steam generators with the new Westinghouse alloy 690 version and TVA had already upgraded all of its existing reactor fleet. We did upgrade them on Watts Barr unit one and both Sequoia unit one and two. The steam generators were replaced with the new Westinghouse generators in the 2000 to 2012 time frame and unit two at Watts Bar was the last pressurized water reactor where we had to replace the steam generators,” says Barajas.",
            "TVA owns and operates several additional nuclear installations and seven reactors in the state, including Browns Ferry and Sequoia.",
            "A long-term steam solution",
            "Although the old units hadn’t failed after only six years of use and they were still operational, by replacing them early the plant owner aimed to remove some risk of the plant shutting down as a result of failures within the steam generators. The plan was to avoid an unexpected outage. TVA monitors crack propagation within the steam generator and chose to execute the replacement programme before actual degradation occurred to the point where any cracking had been observed in the steam tubes in the old units. “We do condition monitoring on the steam generators during every refuel outage. We’re monitoring this stress corrosion cracking and trend over time the condition. We determined that we needed to replace them,” notes Barajas.",
            "In fact, having determined that replacements were required early on during the operational life of the plant, TVA accelerated its replacement programme at unit 2 by around 18 months. Barajas explains: “We ended up replacing the steam generators on unit 2 one refuelling cycle before we had originally planned to be proactive and ensure that we weren’t going to have any issues.”",
            "As part of this industry-wide replacement programme TVA is also anticipating a potential life extension of this plant and others within its reactor fleet.",
            "“The purpose of investing in these new steam generators is so that we can operate the plant safely and reliably over many years to come. We expect the new steam generators to last the remainder of the plant life – that could be anywhere from 40 to 60 years,” she says, adding: “The plants have potentially a 40-odd year life remaining and of course unit two at Watts Bar just came online and it has a 40-year life expectancy but we do expect down the road to potentially request license renewal.”",
            "If the life extension operating licence is requested and approved a full 60-year life would see unit 2 operating for another 54 years. However, the life expectancy of the replacement steam generators offers scope for an even longer life. As Barajas says: “There’s no actual expiration of these steam generators, they could last a lot longer than that. With this new design we expect it to last the lifetime of the plant and that means anywhere from a minimum of 40 years potentially up to 60 or 80 years based on how they progress.”",
            "The Steam Generating Team (SGT), a joint venture between Framatome and United Engineers & Constructors, Inc., was contracted by TVA to execute the steam generator replacement programme.",
            "“We worked through planning and preparations for approximately a year and selecting SGT was really because of their record, their expertise and their knowledge of industry operating experience. SGT had performed one of our steam generator replacements at Sequoia previously so we were familiar with them. They were able to take all of the different lessons learned from all of the steam generator replacements they’ve done and make sure that we put the right contingencies in place to do it efficiently and effectively,” says Barajas. She adds: “Because completing the task within a relatively narrow time window was an important part of the process, when we brought them on site we went through the process methodically making sure that the key people that were brought in had the experience that we needed.”",
            "Barajas emphasises the importance of experience in executing such projects: “Obviously, it’s a very large construction project on an operating nuclear site so the reliance on an expert that has done many steam generator replacements before was beneficial.”",
            "The steam generators are large components. Each of the original units is 67-feet (20m) long and weighs some 360-tonnes. To remove and replace them through the reactor building, temporary openings had to be cut in the reactor building dome, containment and steam generator enclosures.",
            "“Because of the design of Watts Bar we had to cut two large holes, one on each side, on top of our containment approximately 45 feet by 22 feet (13.7 x 6.7m) to access the two steam generator compartments. We have two steam generators per compartment, so we had to cut the top of the concrete shield building dome which is about two feet (60cm) thick,” explains Barajas. “We did use a machine cutting robot that sat on top of containment to cut and process the concrete to remove it,” she says, adding: “Once we were done cutting the shield building, we had to cut the steel reactor vessel liner to about the same size and then in the steam generator compartment we had to cut two holes in the concrete to access each of the two steam generators. It was pretty much a deconstruction of the shield building and the reactor vessel in order access and remove the four steam generators through the top of the building.”",
            "This method was chosen because it wasn’t possible to disassemble the steam generators from within the containment building itself due to their level of contamination.",
            "“We wanted to keep them intact and once we removed the old steam generators they were stored on site in the secure dry storage mausoleum. They’ll remain on site until final decommissioning, however long that is,” notes Barajas.",
            "For the removal of the old steam generators a combination of both machine and manual cutting using different methods were deployed to sever the pipe connections. Barajas says: “Across the four steam generators you’ve got small bore pipes, large bore pipes, main steam pipes, a lot of instrument lines that had to be cut. We have to use tools for cutting that are used by our pipe fitters and pipe fitter welders but it really is a combination of these approaches.”",
            "Precision measurements and meticulous metrology practices were used to support the necessary lifting operations, which were performed using a Sarens DMAG 8800 crawler crane. Some 22 significantly heavy lifts were performed during the project. “SGT hired Sarens, which constructed the world’s second largest crane on site in order to be able to remove the four steam generators and install the new steam generators in addition to removing concrete shield building dome pieces and the steel containment vessel liner on both sides,” says Barajas.",
            "Once the original steam generators had been removed the replacements were lifted into place with 3D fit-up solutions and specialised machining enabling precise placement back into the existing plant configuration. More than 4000 welds were required to install the new steam generators. Due to the potential radiological hazard associated with working close to the reactor pressure vessel several of the installation welds were performed by robotic welding systems developed by Framatome. “One of the reasons we were successful in our steam generator replacement was good preparation and being ready for any issues with the amount of mock-ups and pre-planning key,” says Barajas, adding: “An example would be the use of machine welding on the reactor coolant system piping that attaches to the steam generators. We worked with Framatome closely and they did some innovative machine welding. By replicating the environment that they would have to do the welding at Watts Bar we were able to work out any issues that they had and were also able to prove that the equipment was going to work. The whole process of welding large bore pipe was very successful and was done on time because of that additional mock-up preparation and testing of the machine welding operation.”",
            "Having reconnected all the pipework and instrumentation the openings in the steam generators compartments and the containment vessel had to be repaired. “We had to reinstall the concrete on top of the steam generator enclosure blocks, along with re-welding the steel containment vessel liners on each side. Then we had to pour new concrete on top of the shield building dome to make the shield building dome intact,” says Barajas.",
            "During the steam generator programme a range of other repair and maintenance activities were also undertaken, including a refueling in which 88 of Unit 2’s 193 fuel assemblies were replaced. In addition, more reliable low pressure turbine blades were installed, main turbine controls and feedwater heaters were upgraded and other plant equipment was either replaced or serviced and inspected.",
            "Planning for project success",
            "The outage for the steam generator replacement began in March 2022 and was concluded at the end of June. As Barajas says: “For such a big project that seems like a very short amount of time. That’s why I wanted to emphasize the amount of preparation and planning that we did, incorporating operating experience and lessons learned from other steam generator placements to make it as efficient as possible.”",
            "There were additional challenges associated with executing a large construction project within 50 or 60 feet (15-18 m) of another reactor operating at 100%. “There are some systems that are common between Watts Bar unit 1 and unit 2. A key part was the safety of operating unit one and ensuring unit 1 operated reliably throughout the process of deconstruction and reconstruction of unit 2,” she adds, noting: “A lot of preparation and planning also had to take into account that we had an operating unit and making sure that we were not going to put that unit at risk throughout the process, for example through lifting heavy objects nearby.”",
            "Prior to Watts Bar, the last steam generator replacement carried out by TVA had been over 10 years ago. Enough time so that some of the proficiencies that were gained then could be dissipated. Nonetheless, the latest, and last, replacement programme was deemed a success. “There’s obviously challenges with a large construction project that you have to work through. We focused more on the safety of our people, the environment, nuclear safety and radiological safety so when we say the steam generator placement was successful it was based on those four factors. We had no related recordable injuries so it was very safe and error-free and that’s what we focus on,” says Barajas.",
            "Overall, replacement of the steam generators delivered an opportunity to increase operating life of the reactor and to improve the plant reliability by addressing a well- known degrading component. But the steam generator upgrade yielded other benefits too.",
            "Although the core steam characteristics haven’t changed the generators are now more efficient and TVA is actually getting more power out of the plant now the steam generators have been replaced. “One of the features is increased efficiency. There’s also been some internal modifications done but coming out of the Unit 2 outage we saw about a 20 MWe increase based on the replacement of the four steam generators. It definitely benefits the plant and now we can generate more electricity to provide to our customers,” concludes Barajas."

The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Nuward is now shifting to the basic design phase with the support of EDF Group and its partners.",
            "The Nuward SMR, based on proven PWR technology, is a 340 MWe plant with two reactors of 170 MWe each. The Nuward company will continue to work with its established partners – the Atomic Energy Commission (CEA – Commissariat à l'énergie Atomique et aux énergies Alternatives), TechnicAtome and Naval Group. It will also co-operate with more recent partners – Framatome and Tractebel. Its workforce is expected to increase to about 150 in its core team by 2024, with more than 600 in total including partners' staff contributing to the project.",
            "Nuward President Renaud Crassous said the aim is to \"fully integrate the SMR catalysts for success”. These include innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production. “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the Nuward SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030,\" he added.",
            "According to Xavier Ursat, EDF Group Senior Executive in charge of the Engineering & New Nuclear Projects Division, said that as a subsidiary embedded within the EDF Group, Nuward will be \"a key enabler for a time-to-market product, providing the agility and speed required to meet the next key milestones\".",

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company and Czech power company CEZ have signed an agreement on the supply of fuel assemblies for the Dukovany NPP, which comprises four Soviet-built VVER-440 reactors. Westinghouse says it will deliver fuel beginning in 2024, “replacing the current supplier, with an anticipated term of seven years”. The current fuel supplier is Russia’s TVEL.",
            "According to Westinghouse, the contract “builds on the long-standing partnership between the two companies and a recent agreement to provide modified Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assemblies (RWFA) for the Temelin nuclear power plant”. The Temelin NPP comprises two Russian-designed VVER-1000 units.",
            "CEZ Group concluded contracts with Westinghouse and France’s Framatome in 2022 for the supply of fuel assemblies for the Temelín NPP. Deliveries of assemblies for more than 10 years will begin in 2024. Previously fuel was supplied by TVEL. Currently, CEZ has fuel assemblies for approximately two years of operation at Temelin. The stock at the Dukovany NPP is even greater, CEZ said. \"We decided to increase the stockpile at both NPPs in 2016. As a result, we have enough assemblies at Dukovany for approximately three years of operation of all the units, said Bohdan Zronek, Director of the Cez Nuclear Power Division, at that time. “Of course, we continue to think about the diversification of suppliers,\" he added.",
            "TVEL had long been the fuel supplier for all of CEZ’s NPPs. However, after outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine CEZ began looking for alternative suppliers. While Westinghouse had earlier developed fuel for VVER-1000 reactors, but the design for VVER-440 fuel was still under development. At the end of 2022, Spain’s Enusa Industrias Avanzadas and Westinghouse formalised a cooperation agreement regarding the manufacture of VVER-440 fuel. Enusa began to reinstall a production line for this product at its Juzbado factory with the aim of licensing it in 2023 to make possible fuel deliveries from the beginning of 2024.",
            "Through this agreement, Westinghouse and Enusa will manufacture the fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain, as supply contracts are signed.",
            "Westinghouse and Enusa have partnered since 1974 under a Pressurised-Water Reactor (PWR) fuel technology transfer agreement supporting plants in Spain, Belgium, and France among others. In 1999, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) bought Westinghouse’s commercial nuclear power businesses. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to Fortum’s Loviisa NPP in Finland, which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "These designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006 when Westinghouse was purchased by Toshiba. However, the Loviisa fuel contract was not renewed and Westinghouse withdrew from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "In 2014 reactivation of the VVER-440 market was reconsidered and Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe. It was granted €2m in 2015 to run the European Supply of Safe Nuclear Fuel (ESSANUF) HORIZON 2020 project. Both Enusa and Westinghouse worked together on the ESSANUF project in 2015-2017. Others involved in ESSANUF included VUJE (Slovakia), UJV Rez (Czech Republic), Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland), UK National Nuclear Laboratory, NucleoCon (Slovakia), Kharkiv Institute of Physics & Technology, and the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Karlsruhe (JRC–Karlsruhe). The project was funded under the Euratom Research & Training Programme (2014-2018), which is part of the EU Research & Innovation Framework Horizon 2020.\"",

            "This is part of the programme to extend the operating life of the two-unit NPP by 20 years. Replacement of the steam generators at unit 1 had originally been planned for the first half of 2021, with those of unit 2 to be replaced between January and May 2022. However, this was delayed mainly because of concerns about possible power shortages while the units are offline.",

Eskom submitted the safety case for long-term operation in support of the application in July 2022. The regulator has two years to conclude the review and provide an outcome. No safety concerns have been identified that would preclude long term operation.",
            "The two 930 MWe (net) pressurised water reactors at Koeberg, built by Framatome, began commercial operation in 1984 and 1985. They generate about 5% of the South Africa’s electricity. In 2014, Eskom signed a ZAR4.4bn ($240m) contract with Areva (now Orano) to design, manufacture and install the replacement steam generators. They were made in China under subcontract by Shanghai Electric Power Equipment Company.",

        "text": [
            "France's Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN) has issued a draft decision which should allow EDF to use the current reactor pressure vessel (RPV) head of the 1650 MWe EPR under construction at unit 3 of the Flamanville NPP until the end of the reactor's first operating cycle. Previously ASN had ruled that the vessel head should be replaced by the end of 2024. In 2015, Areva NP (now Framatome) discovered an anomaly in the composition of the steel in certain zones of the RPV's closure head and bottom head of the EPR. A test programme indicated that the mechanical strength of the steel was sufficient in all operating situations, including accident situations and the results were sent to ASN in 2016.",
            "In June 2017, ASN provisionally ruled the unit could start up safely, at the end of 2018 as planned, but that the RPV head would need to be replaced as soon as a new one could be produced. Delivery of the replacement lid is scheduled for October 2024. In October 2018 ASN authorised the commissioning and use of the RPV, subject to implementation of a thermal ageing monitoring test programme and on specific controls during the operation. ASN said that “if no mechanism has been identified that can lead to the rapid creation or propagation of a fault during operation of the reactor … it is therefore acceptable that no control is implemented before the end of 2024 and … consequently, the use of the lid until such a deadline is acceptable from the point of view of nuclear safety\".",
            "At that time, commissioning of the reactor was scheduled for October 2019. However, ASN notes that because of “hazards that have occurred since”, commissioning of the reactor is postponed to the first quarter of the year 2024. “The first operating cycle of the reactor, which includes a testing phase, is planned to last between 15 and 18 months”. This first scheduled shutdown is the one during which the first complete requalification of the primary circuit of the reactor is made.",
            "ASN says “removal of a stop in progress of the first cycle dedicated to the replacement of the lid, will prevent a possible interruption of the reactor start-up tests, to avoid carrying out sensitive operations of shutting down and restarting the reactor and reducing the collective exhibition linked to additional operations, which constitute elements favourable in terms of nuclear safety and radiation protection”.",
            "ASN explained that the postponement requested by Framatome would “lead to a duration of use of the cover of approximately 18 months, ie a shorter period than that envisaged when ASN took its decision in… October 2018, which, given the date then envisaged for the start of the reactor, was about four years”.",
            "ASN’s draft decision therefore recommends that the December 2024 deadline for replacement of the RPV head are replaced by the words: \"from the [first] shutdown of the reactor during which the first complete requalification of the primary circuit is carried out \".",
            "However, the ASN added that, “in the event that the project suffers a significant delay again, the operator will have to re-examine the possibility of replacing the cover before the commissioning of the reactor”. Flamanville 3 has suffered a long series of delays. Construction began in December 2007 and the reactor was originally expected to start commercial operation in 2013. ASN has launched a public consultation on its proposed decision. which will run until 31 March.",

The fuel was fabricated at Framatome’s recently restored manufacturing facility at Romans-sur-Isère in France. The company completed a three-year $80m renovation project in 2021 funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and TRIGA International to restart its fuel production. During the renovation, DOE provided 76 lightly used TRIGA fuel elements to US research reactors to help meet immediate needs.",
            "Framatome and General Atomics created the TRIGA International joint venture in 1995 to market TRIGA fuel elements manufactured at Romans. Framatome subsidiary CERCA is the world’s only manufacturer and supplier of uranium-zirconium hydride fuel for use in TRIGA type research reactors.",
            "In February 2022, the DOE agreed a nine-year contract with TRIGA International to secure new TRIGA fuel elements. It agreed to purchase 668 new fuel elements over the next nine years with an initial procurement of 55. The fuel will be used to support US university research reactors and also for a microreactor nuclear test platform (Marvel) being developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). The first batch of fuel is expected to be shipped to the USA this summer. It should provide a reliable fuel supply for TRIGA reactors worldwide for the first time since 2012.",
            "Training and research reactors play a significant role in the evolution of nuclear energy and in particular in the development of young generations of nuclear engineers and researchers,” said TRIGA International President & Vice President of CERCA at Framatome, François Gauché. Dr Kathryn Huff, US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear said: “A dependable fuel supply for the world’s university research reactors enables our future nuclear energy professionals to receive the hands-on experiences they need to help propel nuclear energy forward.”",
            "TRIGA stands for Training, Research, Isotopes General Atomics. TRIGA pool-type reactors operate at thermal power levels from less than 0.1 to 16 MW, and are pulsed to 22,000 MW. They are used for student training, research projects and isotope production. Three generations have been built worldwide since 1960 comprising some 66 TRIGA reactors with 38 reactors still in operation. These include 17 in the USA. DOE’s Research Reactor Infrastructure programme within the Office of Nuclear Energy provides and coordinates the nuclear fuel elements provided to 12 of those TRIGA research reactors located at US universities.",

USNC's MMR is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) with a thermal capacity of 15 MW and an electrical capacity of 5 MW. It comprises two plants – a nuclear plant that generates heat for an adjacent power plant that converts it into electricity or provides process heat for industrial applications. It will have a sealed transportable core and is designed to use TRISO fuel in prismatic graphite blocks. The MMR is being licensed in Canada and the USA.",
            "“We’ve been working hard to manage and de-risk the front end of our fuel cycle,” says UNSC Executive Vice President Kurt Terrani. “With others facing so much uncertainty regarding fuel supply, it is vital to have reliable commercial partners to source, transport, and deconvert our EUP, feeding our fuel factory operations.”",

Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades. Bulgaria's parliament in January mandated the caretaker government to begin talks with the USA on a potential agreement for the construction of two additional reactors at the Kozloduy NPP (units 7&8) using Westinghouse AP1000 technology.",

However, Siemens is still waiting for a licence from the German authorities to participate in the project.",
            "Hungary’s Minister of Foreign Affairs & Foreign Economic Relations, Peter Szijjártó, told Mandiner magazine: “In case the Germans do not give permission, there are two options. Either the Russians will supply the control system, or we can arrange with the French that their Framatome company take over leadership of the consortium, so the French contribution to this project will increase.” He said he had recently discussed this with the Framatome executives in Paris.",

The French government has already given Framatome permission to supply the technology and equipment. In Germany, on the other hand, Vice Chancellor, Minister for Economic Affairs & Climate Protection Robert Habek, as well as Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock were continuing to block Siemens participation.

The work was carried out under the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) voucher programme.",
            "Lightbridge is developing a new fuel design that incorporates an extruded metallic bar composed of a zirconium-uranium matrix within a zirconium alloy cladding. Lightbridge says this will: significantly increase fuel thermal conductivity (compared with ceramics) promoting lower operating temperatures; offer complete retention of fission products avoiding release of those products upon cladding failure; and support higher power and longer fuel cycles.",
            "The fuel is designed to work in both new and existing reactors. Lightbridge also claims that its fuel increases power output and extends the length of the fuel cycle and offers nuclear plants a better solution for load-follow operations on a grid with renewables.",
            "Working in collaboration with PNNL, the project scope was to demonstrate Lightbridge’s nuclear fuel casting process using depleted uranium, a key step in fuel manufacturing. Several castings were performed throughout the project, and the cast ingots were analysed. The casting methodology was gradually modified based on the characterisation results",
            "Lightbridge has long enjoyed support from DOE and various US national laboratories. In 2018, Lightbridge and France’s Framatome launched Enfission, a 50-50 joint venture (JV) company to develop, license and sell nuclear fuel assemblies. The previous year Lightbridge and Framatome (then Areva) had signed an agreement to set up a JV to develop, manufacture and commercialise Lightbridge’s advanced metallic fuel.",

This was Framatome’s third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design conducted by the Enfission JV. Framatome said the voucher would enable it to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel.",

The framework agreements comprised an “umbrella” Strategic Partnership Project Agreement (SPP) and an “umbrella” CRADA, each with BEA, with an initial duration of seven years. The initial phase of work under the two agreements is expected to culminate in irradiation testing in the ATR of fuel samples using enriched uranium supplied by DOE. The initial phase of work aims to generate irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s delta-phase uranium-zirconium alloy relating to various thermophysical properties. The data will support fuel performance modelling and regulatory licensing efforts for the commercial deployment of Lightbridge Fuel.",
            "The results of this work with PNNL will help Lightbridge determine a final process suitable to produce fuel material coupons for the upcoming irradiation tests in the ATR. Ali Zbib, PNNL nuclear industry programme manager, commented, “One of our missions at PNNL is to support US nuclear industry partners in advancing their technology. Working on this GAIN-funded project was an excellent opportunity to use national laboratory resources and expertise on these fuel development efforts for light water reactors.”",

The physical reality is that nuclear energy is a sustainable, cheap, environmentally friendly and efficient way of producing energy. It also provides a degree of security in the current highly volatile international energy market environment with unreasonably high prices,” Szijjártó said.",
            "He added: “By contrast, the German government continues to block Siemens Energy from delivering the control system already contracted for the Paks NPP. This could be seen as an attack on our sovereignty, as security of energy supply is a matter of sovereignty and the energy mix is a national competence.” He noted that the two members of the German government, the Minister for Economic Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who should authorise the delivery, “have no legal basis whatsoever to block this delivery and jeopardise Hungary’s future energy security”.",

            "Following his meeting with Pannier-Runacher, Szijjártó said neither Hungary or France believe sanctioning nuclear cooperation with Russia is beneficial. \"Together we fought hard for the EU to classify nuclear energy as sustainable and together we are fighting against discrimination against nuclear energy,” he said. \"We were successful, and today we agreed to maintain this strategic cooperation in the field of nuclear energy in the next period as well.\"",
            "He also emphasised that the parties agree that it makes no sense to impose sanctions on the Russian nuclear industry. “In any case, Hungary would not have given its consent to possible sanctions concerning nuclear cooperation. We are glad that France also sees that this type of measures would be pointless,” he said.",
            "Szijjártó stressed that professional cooperation in the field of nuclear energy with Russia should be maintained. \"The countries that can produce a significant part of the energy they use themselves will be in an advantageous position, and for us this option is offered by nuclear energy, and thus the investment in Paks.\"",

        "text": [
            "At the request of the French Government, the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority) has issued an opinion on the safety of EDF’s EPR 1200 pressurised water reactor project. EDF is developing the EPR1200, mainly for export, in respond to calls for tenders for medium-power reactors, in particular one issued in March 2022 by the Czech power company ČEZ. ASN's opinion on these safety options for this reactor is broadly similar to its opinion given in July 2019 on the EPR2 reactor, from which it is derived.",
            "The main differences relate to the power level (1,200 MWe instead of 1,650 MWe), and the number of steam generators (three instead of four). ASN notes that the safety objectives, the reference systems used for the design and the architecture of the safety systems are taken from the EPR2 model including adaptations made after 2019. ASN said it “considers that the renewal of as much equipment as possible from the EPR2 reactor on a lower power reactor is likely to strengthen the safety margins”.",
            "ASN said EDF “has retained the same general safety objectives for the EPR1200 reactor project as for the EPR and EPR2 reactors and the requirement of resistance to extreme aggressions of natural origin has been integrated from the design, which is satisfactory”. ASN “considers that the safety framework for the design of the EPR1200 reactor meets the requirements of French regulations”.",
            "ASN’s opinion will remain valid “in the absence of technological developments likely to improve the safety, evolution of knowledge likely to evolve the demonstration of nuclear safety, a major event or evolution of French and international regulations or recommendations”.",
            "EDF says the EPR1200 fully benefits from EPR lessons learned. “The EPR1200 is a completely European-grown Generation III+ nuclear reactor. It is specifically designed to meet various regulatory, site and grid conditions whilst strongly focusing its value chain within Europe.” However, the EPR has had a difficult history.",
            "Currently the only two EPR reactors in operation are at China’s Taishan NPP in Guangdong province – both constructed with significant Chinese participation. Construction of Taishan 1 began in 2009, followed by unit 2 in 2010. The EPRs entered commercial operation in December 2018 and September 2019, some five years behind schedule.",
            "In Europe, the Olkiluoto 3 EPR in Finland was connected to the grid on 12 March 2022 and is scheduled to enter regular electricity generation next month but is more than 10 years behind schedule and significantly over budget. Similarly the EPR under construction at unit 3 of France’s Flamanville NPP is 10 years behind schedule and over budget. Two EPRs are under construction at Hinkley Point C in the UK, currently slated for commercial operation in 2027 (unit 1) and 2028 (unit 2).",
            "Acknowledging the difficulties it was having building the EPR design, EDF and Framatome have now developed \"a simplified and optimised\" EPR design – the EPR2, which is the basis for the EPR1200. It incorporates design, construction and commissioning experience feedback from the EPR reactor, as well as operating experience from the nuclear reactors currently in service.",

Framatome and USNC have signed a non-binding Heads of Terms Agreement to integrate their complementary resources to bring commercially viable fuel to market for advanced reactor designs.",
            "USNC, headquartered in Seattle, is developing a Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) and produces FMC nuclear fuel based on TRISO fuel particles. FCM fuel enhances safety through proprietary technology to embed TRISO particles in a silicon carbide matrix. In August 2022, USNC announced the opening of its Pilot Fuel Manufacturing (PFM) facility in Oak Ridge at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), to produce the first fuel for testing and qualification for use in its MMR.",
            "The PFM contains full scale production equipment for TRISO particles, and USNC’s FCM Fuel. The privately owned facility is located on the Manhattan Project site previously occupied by the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. USNC produced its first uranium bearing TRISO particles earlier in 2022. PFM engineers employ additive manufacturing (3D printing) to fabricate FCM fuel. “The modular production lines for TRISO particles and FCM fuel, already demonstrated at scale at the PFM facility, are rapidly repeated to increase capacity to meet growing demand for the MMR and advanced reactor technologies more broadly,” USNC notes.",
            "The company has active MMR deployment projects at the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (Chalk River) with Ontario Power Generation and at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The project at Chalk River is targeting 2026 for first power, with the UIUC project targeted for first power the following year.",
            "USNC says its vertical integration “captures the entire value chain, from fuel manufacturing to reactor construction and operation, maximises competitive advantage and reduces risk”. Ala Alzaben, senior vice president for North America Fuel at Framatome says: “Ultra Safe Nuclear is a pioneer in the manufacture of both TRISO-based nuclear fuels and micro reactors, both of which contribute to a clear and attainable path toward a low carbon future.”",
            "USNC CEO Francesco Venneri say: “Framatome is an important strategic partner in our quest, and this move is a crucial step towards our vision of socially and environmentally responsible zero-carbon nuclear power.” Framatome was selected as a partner “as a result of thorough review and due diligence”, says USNC executive vice president Kurt Terrani. “Not only does Framatome have a long history of safely and economically manufacturing nuclear fuels, the company’s deep experience in manufacturing will be key to our success in bringing commercial TRISO and FCM fuel forms to market in rapid fashion.”",
            "The joint venture expects to begin manufacturing TRISO particles and FCM fuel in late 2025. TRISO fuel production capacity will be used in the manufacture of USNC’s FCM fuel and available to the broader commercial market. The partners have developed concrete plans to support rapid expansion to meet demand growth in the US and global markets.",

            "Czech power company ČEZ expects to invest more than CZK2.3bn ($104m) in the Dukovany NPP in 2023, almost CZK500m more than last year. The investments are primarily aimed at ensuring the plant can continue to operate until at least 2047. Dukovany is also switching to 16-month fuel campaigns for all four units and plans to recruit about 100 new employees.",
            "The Czech Republic has six commercially operational reactor units: four Russian designed VVER-440 units at Dukovany site, which began operation between 1985 and 1987, and two VVER-1000 units at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. Total installed nuclear capacity is 3934 MWe accounting for 32.5% of electricity generation.",
            "The modernisation of Dukovany will include the restoration and upgrading of both production and non-production equipment. \"The investments are aimed at ensuring the safe operation of Dukovany for at least 60 years, even at the cost of more work this year,” says Bohdan Zronek, member of the ČEZ Board of directors and Director of the nuclear power division.",
            "The increased work this year will also mean longer outages. According Dukovany NPP Director Roman Havlin, the most time-consuming and technically demanding project is a project for cleaning steam generators. \"Last year, in collaboration with our colleagues from Framatome, we were the first in the world to develop and test a cleaning method that can remove mineral deposits inside the equipment and thus ensure their expected service life,\" Dukovany has 24 of these steam generators, most of which will undergo cleaning in the coming years.",
            "The four units are also gradually switching from the original 12-month fuel campaigns to 16-months This will significantly increase their efficiency of both operation and maintenance, ČEZ notes.",
            "Zronek told journalists that extended fuel cycles were becoming standard. \"Most of the world's power plants operate in 18-month cycles, some even longer,\" he said.",
            "The longer fuel campaigns will use new PK3 + fuel supplied by Russia’s TVEL. The fuel was delivered to the site last year the plant already has already applied to the State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB) for a licence to use it. The RK 3+ design has enhanced physical and thermo-hydraulic properties compared with previous generations of VVER-440 fuel. It has a longer fuel rod pitch that streamlines the water-uranium ratio in the reactor core and increases the efficiency of the fuel.",
            "Dukovany has been using TVEL’s fuel for 40 years and currently has fuel reserves for at least three years. However, under pressure from the EU and the US, and especially in the wake of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, the Czech Republic is looking to diversity its fuel suppliers. From 2024 US-based Westinghouse and France’s Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin NPP. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel.",
            "\"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know,\" Havlín explained. SÚJB chairwoman Dana Drábová said last year that she did not expect it would be necessary to change fuel suppliers for the roughly 20 years of operation that remained for the Dukovany plant. She noted that TVEL produces fuel of excellent parameters. \"CEZ will have to come to terms with the fact that the fuel from the new supplier will not be optimised for performance, as was the case with the fuel from TVEL.\"",
            "Nevertheless, a decision to secure fuel supplies from companies other than Russia’s TVEL for Dukovany is expected. \"I can't imagine being dependent on just one supplier in the future. Some negotiations are underway, I can't say the details yet,\" noted Havlín.",

Flamanville 3, which is already some 10 years behind schedule, is expected to start operations in the first quarter of 2024. However, the Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority) had requested replacement of the reactor's vessel closure head by the end of 2024. This would mean the reactor would only operate for a few months before having to shut again for the work to be done. Framatome has now asked ASN to delay replacement of the vessel cover so it will coincide with the first fuel reloading rather than replacing it at the end of 2024.",
            "In December, Plant owner/operator Electricite de France (EDF) said the schedule for construction of Flamanville 3 had been further delayed and that its estimated cost had also increased. The 1,600 MWe Flamanville 3 EPR, which started construction in 2007, was originally expected to cost €3bn and to be ready in four years. However, it faced a series of delays and technical issues.",

It put the estimated cost of completion at €13.2 billion ($14bn), up from the previous estimate of €12.7 billion. EDF said the revisions were mainly due to additional studies needed to establish a new process for the stress-relieving heat treatment of some welds that have had to be upgraded in the last two years.",
            "ASN did not say whether it intended to approve Framatome's request to adjust the timeframe for the vessel closure head replacement, which had been determined before EDF announced the latest delay. However, ASN did say that France's nuclear safety needs a global and systemic review. ASN head Bernard Doroszczuk told a news conference that, by the end of 2024, EDF must explain how it plans to extend the life of its nuclear plants up to or beyond 60 years, in order to formulate a first position on the issue within a further two years.",

            "Doroszczuk said a nuclear safety review needs to anticipate the effects of ageing on nuclear installations as well as new challenges presented by climate change. \"We need to identify for which components there may be a limit to their operating lifespan,\" he noted. He explained that some components are hard to replace, while other cannot be replaced, such as the reactor vessel and the reactor building.",

            "US nuclear fuel developer Lightbridge Corporation has announced that it has entered into landmark agreements with Idaho National Laboratory (INL), in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE), to support the development of Lightbridge Fuel. The framework agreements comprise an “umbrella” Strategic Partnership Project Agreement (SPP) and an “umbrella” Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), each with Battelle Energy Alliance, (BEA), DOE’s operating contractor for INL, with an initial duration of seven years.",
            "The initial phase of work under the two agreements is expected to culminate in irradiation testing in INL’s Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) of fuel samples using enriched uranium supplied by DOE. The initial phase of work aims to generate irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s delta-phase uranium-zirconium alloy relating to various thermophysical properties. The data will support fuel performance modelling and regulatory licensing efforts for the commercial deployment of Lightbridge Fuel.",
            "It is anticipated that subsequent phases of work under the two agreements will include post-irradiation examination of the irradiated fuel samples, loop radiation testing in the ATR, and post-irradiation examination of one or more uranium-zirconium fuel rodlets, as well as transient experiments in the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT) at INL.",
            "Lightbridge President and CEO Seth Grae said this “marks a major milestone for Lightbridge and our fuel development programme”. He added: We look forward to working closely with INL, which Congress has designated as the nation’s lead nuclear energy research and development laboratory and is DOE’s lead nuclear fuel testing laboratory. Securing a long-term strategic relationship with INL, in collaboration with DOE, gives Lightbridge access to state-of-the-art ATR and TREAT reactor test facilities.”",
            "However, Lightbridge has long enjoyed support from DOE and INL. In January 2018, Lightbridge Corporation and France’s Framatome launched Enfission, a 50-50 joint venture (JV) company to develop, license and sell nuclear fuel assemblies. The previous year Lightbridge and Framatome (then Areva) had signed an agreement to set up a JV to develop, manufacture and commercialise Lightbridge’s advanced metallic fuel. In May 2019, Lightbridge Corporation announced that Framatome had received a voucher from the DOE’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) programme to support the development of Lightbridge Fuel in collaboration with the INL.",
            "This was Framatome’s third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design conducted by the Enfission JV. Framatome said the voucher would enable it to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel. The voucher was valued at $477,000 for work to be carried out over 12 months.",
            "In April 2020, Lightbridge entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the operator of INL, to design an experiment for irradiation of metallic fuel material in the ATR. That agreement was valued at $845,000, with DOE funding three-quarters of this the GAIN programme. Lightbridge and INL were to establish the test plan for measuring key thermo-physical properties of Lightbridge Fuel material both before and after irradiation in the ATR.",
            "The following year, in March 2021, Lightbridge and France’s Framatome terminated their Enfission joint venture. In July 2021 announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division, the operating contractor of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with the DOE. The goal of this agreement was to advance a critical stage in the manufacturing process of Lightbridge Fuel by demonstrating a casting process using depleted uranium-zirconium material. The total project value of the CRADA was approximately $663,000, with three-quarters of this funded by DOE for the scope performed by PNNL.",
            "In June 2022, Lightbridge announced that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had been awarded approximately $800,000 by DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program R&D Awards to study the deployment of Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF) in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The project, funded entirely by DOE, would include simulation of the fuel and safety performance of Lightbridge Fuel inside a SMR designed by NuScale Power.",
            "Lightbridge is developing a new fuel design that incorporates an extruded metallic bar composed of a zirconium-uranium matrix within a zirconium alloy cladding. Lightbridge says this will: significantly increase fuel thermal conductivity (compared with ceramics) promoting lower operating temperatures; offer complete retention of fission products avoiding release of those products upon cladding failure; and support higher power and longer fuel cycles.",
            "The fuel is designed to work in both new and existing ($20+ billion market) reactors. Lightbridge also claims that its fuel increases power output and extends the length of the fuel cycle and offers nuclear plants a better solution for load-follow operations on a grid with renewables.",
            "INL’s nuclear research capabilities rely heavily on the ATR, located at the ATR Complex on the INL Site near Idaho Falls. Numerous upgrades and improvements have been done since ATR entered service in 1967. ATR is a one-of-a-kind pressurised water test reactor that operates at very low pressures and temperatures compared with a large commercial nuclear power plant. The main product of a test reactor is neutrons rather than heat. ATR uses a beryllium reflector to help concentrate neutrons in the core, where they are needed for fuels and materials testing. ATR employs a unique design in which key internal components can be completely replaced during a core overhaul (Core Internals Changeout) every 10 years on average to enable long-term operations. The sixth core overhaul took place during 2021-2022.",

            "TRIGA – Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomics – is a nuclear reactor model designed by General Atomics and used for research and training activities by scientific institutions and universities. There are currently 36 TRIGA reactors in operation around the world. The TRIGA reactor uses unique low-enriched, long-lifetime uranium zirconium hydride (UZrH) fuel which has desirable characteristics of a large negative fuel temperature coefficient. This means that as the temperature rises, reactivity rapidly decreases and while the reactor can be briefly pulsed to very high energy outputs (up to 22 GW reported) it is a very safe design. The fuel is the fundamental feature of the TRIGA family of reactors and accounts for its widely recognised safety, rugged, dependable performance, economy of operation, and its acceptance worldwide.",
            "Along with on-going research programmes, reactor designers have been inspired by the TRIGA fuel design and technology and are currently exploring applications for smaller reactors. Among those designs is the US Department of Energy’s MARVEL microreactor project.",

Due to reduced fuel demand and increasing licensing requirements, General Atomics was interested in relocating its fuel fabrication facility while maintaining the fuel supply for these research reactors.",
            "Meanwhile, the US Department of Energy (DOE) was financing a programme to convert TRIGA reactors still running on higher enriched uranium (HEU) fuel to lower enriched uranium (LEU) fuel. This DOE programme was securing business for the future, further driving General Atomics desire to find a partner that could manufacture TRIGA fuel among other fuel manufacturing activities and to make it more cost effective.",

As a manufacturer of metallic fuels for research reactors, CERCA was selected as the preferred partner for General Atomics. Framatome and General Atomics created the TRIGA International SAS joint venture in 1995 to market TRIGA fuel elements manufactured by CERCA.",
            "Today, Framatome CERCA is the only supplier of uranium- zirconium hydride (UZrH) fuel for use in TRIGA-type research reactors.",
            "In 2018, a refurbishment project was initiated to address the fuel needs of the US TRIGA reactors and to bring the facility up to modern state-of-the-art safety standards. The project was made possible with funding from the US DOE and capital from TRIGA International. The DOE was a catalyst in providing nearly $16m in support of the facility upgrades also funded by Framatome. The National Nuclear Security Administration provided $5m in initial funding to perform feasibility studies and assist with the design, installation and removal of equipment while the Office of Nuclear Energy provided more than $10m to complete the work to get the production line up and running. Renovations were completed early 2021.",
            "To produce TRIGA fuel elements, the UZrH alloy is created by melting uranium and zirconium in a graphite mold to obtain UZr bars with a required chemical composition.",
            "A surface treatment and hydriding process is then performed to obtain the final UZrH bars. Three of these UZrH bars are assembled using a stainless steel cladding tube and end caps for the final fuel element. The main difference between TRIGA fuel and MARVEL fuel is the number of bars in one fuel element. The MARVEL fuel design requires five fuel bars whereas TRIGA fuel uses three. During the production process inspections are performed at several stages to ensure the integrity of the chemistry and the accuracy of the dimensions. Once confirmed, a final leak test is performed on the finished product prior to distribution.",
            "Uprating production and ensuring quality",
            "Since 2018, a dedicated project team led the work to accommodate new equipment for the upstream and downstream processes at the site. With the latest technologies and advanced functionality, the upgrades included a lathe, grinding machine, cladding units, welding equipment, controls, and melting and hydriding furnaces.",
            "The new equipment is fitted with modern instrumentation and controls for better quality control of the products, better yields in the manufacturing process, and reliable equipment for improved productivity.",
            "In addition, many specialised fields of industry such as, metallurgy, chemistry, machining, and welding, can be found within the TRIGA production facility.",
            "Upgrades to the sole source of TRIGA fuel strengthened safety measures and ensured the supply of TRIGA fuel to meet customers’ long-term demands. It means the fuel is also available for advancements in fuel designs for small modular reactors and potential advanced reactor opportunities.",
            "With the necessary approvals from the French Nuclear Authority (ASN), TRIGA International resumed manufacturing operations of enriched zirconium-uranium ingots as scheduled.",
            "The first new fuel elements are expected to be completed by the end of 2022.",
            "Rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures ensure that the TRIGA fuel meets US standards and qualification requirements, such as the ASME Nuclear Quality Assurance (NAQ-1) certification programme.",
            "Currently, there are 36 operational TRIGA reactors supporting research programmes in the US and around the world. These reactors provide access to nuclear technology and educational and experiential training for the next generation of scientists and engineers operating in the field of nuclear energy. These reactors are critical in gaining and maintaining the specialised competencies by the industry’s personnel now and into the future.",
            "With the advancements being made in the nuclear industry, TRIGA nuclear fuel supports these reactors in their continued operations and in the development of the next generation of the vital clean energy workforce."

            "Eduardo Grand Court, the new president of Brazilian nuclear utility Eletronuclear (formerly part of Eletrobras) has attended an event at the Angra dos Reis NPP marking the restart of the concreting process at Angra 3 and the resumption of civil works at the plant, which is expected to be ready in 2028.",
            "Currently, Brazil has two nuclear power plants in operation, both in Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde, in Rio de Janeiro. Angra 1&2, a total of 1.9GWe, generate 1.1% of the energy of the Brazilian Interconnected System (SIN). Angra 1 is a 609MWe Westinghouse PWR 609, which began operation in 1982 following long delays. Unit 2 is a 1,275MWe PWR supplied by German Kraftwerk Union that began operation in 2000, again after long delays. Eletrobrás is working with Westinghouse to extend the operating lifetime of Angra 1 from 40 to 60 years.",
            "Work on Angra 3, a Siemens/KWU 1,405MWe PWR began in 1984 but was suspended two years later. Work resumed in 2006, but was suspended a number of times for financial and political reasons. It was stopped again in 2015 when it was 65% complete. Preparation for the restart of concreting began in February 2022 with the signing of a contract between Eletronuclear and the AGIs consortium, comprising Ferreira Guedes, Matricial and ADtranz. This included the assembly of a concrete plant on site in September, and numerous field and laboratory tests.",
            "Eletronuclear noted that “the quality of the concrete, both of the aggregated elements – such as sand, stone, water and cement – and their proportion in the final mixture, the so-called TRACE, is the subject of rigorous technical evaluation by Eletronuclear and the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), which authorised the restart of concreting”.",
            "The pouring of first concrete signalled the start of the Angra 3 Critical Path Acceleration Plan, which aims to complete the civil works of the main buildings of the plant. In addition, it is planned to carry out part of the electromechanical assembly, such as the closure of the containment and the installation of key equipment, such as the used fuel pool, the polar bridge and the semi-gantry crane. The unit will, as originally planned, use German origin technology developed by Siemens/KWU, which is now owned by the French company Framatome.",
            "Last year, several preliminary stages were carried out, including the conclusion of the bidding process for contracting the works to resume the civil works and part of the electromechanical assembly. According to the financial statements of Eletrobras, then the controller of Eletronuclear, investments in Angra 3 totalled BRL1.24 billion ($233m) in 2021. Although the privatisation of Eletrobras was concluded in 2022, Eletronuclear was part of a group of subsidiaries maintained under the control of the State. They were integrated into a new state-owned company, Empresa Brasileira de Participacoes em Energia Nuclear e Binacional (ENBpar), which led the resumption of the Angra 3 works.",

        "text": [
            "The pressure on uranium supplies has also attracted the interest of commodities traders. (Credit: Shane McLendon on Unsplash)",
            "The Russian invasion of Ukraine “sent a shiver down the spine of nuclear fuel buyers around the world,” said Tom Gitsel, chief executive of Canadian uranium miner Cameco, talking through the company’s first half results in June. He pointed out that “the global nuclear industry relies on Russia for approximately 14% of uranium concentrates, 7% of conversion supply and 39% of enrichment capacity”.",
            "Phillipe Knoche, chief executive of state-backed French nuclear front-end company Orano, in his company’s half-year presentation on 29 July, was keen to stress that the nuclear industry was relatively immune to short-term shocks. Knoche said there was, “no strong disruption of the market,” noting that uranium and nuclear fuel buyers do not revisit their contracts every half year or year, instead relying on longer-term contracts, so they have some flexibility in when to return to the market.",
            "The Russian invasion has shaken the market at a time when it was already changing. Even before that event there was “an unprecedented global realignment occurring in the global nuclear fuel cycle,” Gitsel said. He said that in his markets, “durability” – the visibility of a robust future pipeline of orders – was better than he had ever seen it. He put that down to three continuing factors: Net Zero targets (which he said now cover 90% of the global population); the ongoing need to lift a third of the world’s population out of ‘energy poverty’; and the need to grow power grids and provide users with consistent, baseload power. Nuclear is at the “centre of that triangle,” he said.",
            "But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed even those major drivers of nuclear development. Many countries now have to manage those requirements and move beyond the current energy crises: “pivoting away from Russian energy without jeopardising those NZ commitments”. Gitsel described it as a wake-up call for some countries which had been too focused on one part of the triangle: “Net Zero made them forget about providing baseload and power security. They have been left relying on Russian energy supplies.”",
            "Gitsel was confident about growth in the long- and medium-term future of nuclear, but he was cautious about whether the conditions were in place for more uranium extraction. Instead, it is likely to be slow to respond to rising demand.",
            "“For some time now we have said that the uranium market is as vulnerable to a supply shock as it has ever been, due to persistently low prices,” Gitsel explained.",
            "He referred to supply curtailments in existing productive capacity, along with a lack of new developments, at a time when deepening geopolitical and origin risk – due to concentration of supply and regionalisation – are affecting the availability of critical minerals. What is more, the industry no longer has a stock of secondary supplies that it could rely on to fill the gaps in the past.",
            "All these internal factors suggest pressure for expansion from uranium suppliers, now potentially boosted by some countries’ wish to move away from Russian supply. But Gitsel for one said Cameco would “maintain discipline” in any expansion of capacity, not taking major investment steps until the company has long-term contracts signed with customers. The industry is also facing external pressures such as covid and inflation, which are interrupting flow of goods and services in the uranium market and increasing costs.",
            "Kazatomprom similarly noted that expanding the supply side was a process that takes a year or more, but in a market statement at the end of June, it highlighted one source of extra capacity. It described plans approved by Boss Energy to restart development at the Honeymoon project in South Australia as “a notable supply-side highlight”. Boss raised A$125m (US$87m) earlier this year to fund the restart. It expects Honeymoon to resume production late next year and ramp up to steady-state production of some 2.45 million pounds of U3O8 per year within three years.",
            "The pressure on uranium supplies has also attracted the interest of commodities traders who are purchasing significant volumes of uranium and sequestering it. Two have been active in the spot market: Yellowcake PLC was set up in 2018 “to provide investors with exposure to the uranium commodity at a time when the supply/demand fundamentals strongly suggested a resurgence in uranium prices”. It holds physical uranium oxide in storage accounts at Cameco’s Port Hope/Blind River facility in Ontario, Canada, and in Orano Cycle’s Malvési/Tricastin storage facility in France. Meanwhile, precious metal and real asset investment company Sprott also launched a trust in 2021 to buy and hold physical uranium oxide, alongside its other trusts focusing on precious metals. Both Sprott and Yellowcake have been acquiring uranium on the assumption that its value will increase.",
            "These new players have helped create volatility in uranium spot prices and so has Russia’s action: Kazatomprom said market participants’ concerns about security of supply in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict drove up the spot price initially.",
            "Prices drifted downwards until June, when concerns about delays in a Russian delivery from St. Petersburg pushed the average spot price back up.",
            "The companies say little of that volatility will pass through to contracts. Both Orano and Cameco stressed that they have little exposure to spot prices, as instead they are focusing on long-term contracts. Kazatomprom said its contract portfolio pricing “correlates closely to uranium spot prices” but time lags between contract and delivery, as well as elements of long-term pricing in the contracts, meant it achieved prices below current spot market levels. Orano’s Knoche also noted that “some clients have several years of fissile material stored.“",
            "Uranium companies are more concerned about the delivery of uranium than about volumes of supply.",
            "Kazatomprom said, “transportation challenges were highlighted throughout the first half of 2022 due to many nations’ and companies’ efforts to reduce transactions with and decrease reliance on Russia, in light of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.” It noted that Canada’s revision to its Special Economic Measures on Russia resulted in shipping delays for a Russian enriched uranium product (EUP) delivery that was destined for the United States. The modified Canadian rules “could be interpreted to mean the Canadian company CIS Navigation and its carrier, Atlantic Ro-Ro Carriers, would be unable to transport Russian EUP from the port of St Petersburg to three American utilities aboard its Canadian-owned vessel.” That shipment won temporary exemption from the new rules and Kazatomprom believes the exemption will be in place for a year.",
            "The new Canadian rules would not affect Kazatomprom’s deliveries of uranium oxide, the company said. But it added that “a significant proportion of the company’s products are exported on a well-established primary route through Russia to the Port of St. Petersburg, which presents a specific set of risks associated with transit through the territory of Russia, shipping insurance, and the delivery of cargo by sea vessels.” The company said it shipped its second quarter volumes via St Petersburg without any disruptions or logistical/insurance-related issues but it is monitoring the growing list of sanctions on Russia and their potential impact.",
            "Kazatomprom highlighted a Trans-Caspian route, “which has been successfully used as an alternative route since 2018,” to mitigate the risk of the primary route being unavailable. It is reinforcing transit agreements with authorities along that alternate route. It said it already has received approval to ship 3500 tonnes of uranium and has applied for an increase in order to accommodate more. Kazatomprom stressed that its product “remains of Kazakh origin through to its arrival at a western conversion facility”.",
            "Gitsel also highlighted the risk of Russia imposing export constraints and said there was uncertainty over potential shipments of uranium through Black Sea ports, which could affect shipments from central Asia. He said that “while it is still technically possible to ship through Russia, due to insurance and other issues we have decided to delay a shipment from Inkai in Kazakhstan and work with our partner to establish an alternate shipping route. This could take a long time, but we will mitigate with inventory, purchase commitments and loans.” Comeco is a joint venture partner at Inkai mine with a 40% stake.",
            "In response to the invasion, Comeco said it is “already seeing companies pivot their procurement strategies to more carefully weigh the origin risk” and in the long term that was likely to remain a concern for companies which were under scrutiny over ESG governance.",
            "Gitsel noted that in response to Russia’s invasion many countries have imposed strict economic sanctions on Russia. Energy imports that have been subject to sanctions include oil, natural gas and coal – but, so far, that has not applied to nuclear fuel. Nevertheless, he said there was uncertainty over relying on nuclear fuel coming from Russia, “whether because of sanctions or a conflict with company values”. He said that some utilities will voluntarily pivot away from Russian fuel supplies because they recognise the incongruity with their values and key principles.",
            "“From our perspective it is not a matter of whether western countries will turn their backs on Russian fuel supplies, but when and how quickly,” he said.",
            "Russian fuel supplier TVEL claims 17% of the world fuel market, with fuel customers in 11 countries as well as in Russia. TVEL lists customers in Finland (two units), the Czech Republic (six units), Hungary (four units), Slovakia (four units), Bulgaria (two units), Armenia (one unit), Ukraine (nine units), Belarus (one unit), China (two units), India (two units) and what it calls ‘Western Europe’ (three units).",
            "Russia continues to make fuel deliveries – this year it sent batches to Kudankulam – but some customers are leaking away. At the time of the invasion six units in Ukraine – South Ukraine 2 and 3 and Zaporizhzhia 1, 3, 4 and 5 – were already testing Westinghouse-supplied VVER1000 fuel. Sweden has also cancelled Russian uranium supply contracts. Slovakia took a delivery of fresh fuel from Russia shortly after the February invasion, at the start of March, and said it has enough nuclear fuel for its two power stations for the entire year and some of next year. Russia’s TVEL has been the country’s sole supplier but Westinghouse was in competition to supply fuel for Mochovce in a procurement exercise in 2018. TVEL was said to have won the contract on cost.",
            "Czech state-controlled utility ČEZ said it has fuel assemblies for approximately two years of operation at Temelín while the stock at the Dukovany plant is even higher. “We decided to increase the stockpile volume at both nuclear power plants in 2016. Thanks to this, we have enough assemblies at Dukovany for approximately three years of operation of all the units. Of course, we continue to think about the diversification of suppliers,” said Bohdan Zronek, a member of the Board of Directors and Director of the Nuclear Power Division.",
            "In June ČEZ confirmed it has signed agreements with US- based Westinghouse Electric and France’s Framatome for the supply of fuel assemblies for the Temelín nuclear power station under a new 15-year contract.",
            "According to ČEZ, the new fuel deliveries will begin to fully replace TVEL as fuel supplier in 2024. During the supplier transition Westinghouse said it will supply modified Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assemblies (RWFA), a new design that is compatible with non-Westinghouse fuel.",
            "Westinghouse-made lead fuel assemblies have been in operation in the reactor core of Temelín 1 since 2019. Tarik Choho, President of EMEA Operating Plant Services at Westinghouse said the company, “has developed and supplied for many years our own VVER fuel designs for both the VVER 1000 and the VVER 440 types of reactors. We are extremely happy that our successful experience in supplying VVER fuel is going to benefit ČEZ”.",
            "What is the overall message from this mix of factors affecting the front end of nuclear’s fuel-cycle? A year ago the issues seemed clear, even if there were several potential outcomes. The urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and electrify new sectors of the economy presented a great opportunity for the nuclear industry. New-build had more urgency in some western countries and was under debate in some where it had been off the table for decades. What is more, interest in countries that had not previously had nuclear was building, with an institutional framework being set up or strengthened and in some cases site investigations. Some projects that had been in discussion for decades, such as Akkuyu in Turkey, were actually becoming a reality.",
            "Front end companies were ready to respond to that changing landscape. They were making initial investments to allow them to expand their facilities and activities – albeit that they were waiting for long-term contracts from customers before stepping up that investment.",
            "All that remains the case. But the ground has been shifted by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. It is a world- changing event that will have effects in the short, medium and far term.",
            "The global nature of the fuel supply chain, and nuclear operators’ extremely cautious approach to securing fuel supplies, have so far meant the system has absorbed the shock in the short term.",
            "The medium term may see a shift towards western suppliers. Nuclear fuel will remain an important industry for Russia, but western competitors may well see an opportunity for a market share grab by stepping in.",
            "The long-term future of Russia’s fuel supply business is closely linked to its reactor supply and build business. Both are important industries nationally. How much of that new- build business will remain, will depend on Russia’s ability to continue to provide funding alongside hardware for emerging nuclear industries, and that is a geopolitical and financial issue that will emerge as the end game in Ukraine is played out. The long-term implications are unlikely to be clear this year – or even next.",

Paks II, comprising two VVER-1200 reactors, is being built by Rosatom. \"The control technology for the new nuclear power plant will be supplied by a German-French consortium, in which Germany's Siemens plays a leading role. It will supply the most important control equipment,\" Szijjártó told journalists.",
            "The Minister stressed that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear energy \"will be of the greatest importance in the coming period for ensuring energy security\" in Hungary. In this regard, Szijjarto noted the fact that the nuclear energy sector was not affected by the sanctions imposed by the European Union against Russia, and European companies will be able to continue participating in the Paks II project.",
            "Currently, the Paks NPP, built according to the Soviet design, operates four power units with VVER-440 reactors. The Hungarian Parliament in 2009 approved construction of two new units. The Paks II project was launched in 2014 by an inter-governmental agreement between Hungary and Russia for two VVER-1200 reactors (units 5&6) to be supplied by Rosatom. The contract was supported by a Russian state loan to finance the majority of the project. The Hungarian Atomic Energy Authority (HAEA) issued the licence for the units in August.",
            "In October 2021, Rusatom – Automated Control Systems JSC (a subsidiary of Rosatom) and the Franco-German consortium Framatome SAS – Siemens AG signed an agreement in Moscow on the manufacture and commissioning of automated process control systems for the new units . Earlier, within the framework of this project, a contract was signed for the manufacture of turbines by GE Hungary Kft., which is a Hungarian subsidiary of the American General Electric. With this in mind, the withdrawal of nuclear energy from the EU sanctions is of particular importance for the Paks II project.",

            "France is preparing legislation to reduce red tape related to nuclear power projects and aims to start construction of its first next-generation EPR2 reactor before May 2027, an energy ministry official has said. President Emmanuel Macron announced plans in February to build at least six EPR2 reactors, as well as the possibility of eight additional reactors, with a first project from 2028 and initial commissioning by 2035.",
            "The government is now seeking to minimise the bureaucratic processes involved. The bill, which will be presented to the Council of Ministers before the launch of a public debate at the end of October, will simplify procedures and reduce the risk of multiple legal objections.",
            "“The objective is for the procedural part and the authorisations to last less than five years and for the construction works of the first EPR2 to begin before the end of the presidential term, before May 2027,” the ministry official told journalists. \"The latest schedule … foresees that the commercial operations of this reactor will start from 2035-36.\"",
            "The bill has already met with opposition from environmental groups.",
            "Pauline Boyer of Greenpeace France noted: “The government proposes a law to accelerate the installation of new nuclear reactors before any consultation with the population! It’s a democratic hijacking.” Greenpeace said it would ignore any public consultation processes related to new NPP construction. \"The only thing this bill will accelerate is the regression of environmental law,\" Boyer said in a statement.",
            "A report released by Matignon in February estimated the total construction cost of six EPR2s, in a median scenario and on the basis of commissioning the first reactor by 2037, at €51.7 billion ($49.8 billion). Energy company EDF intends to build the reactors at three existing NPP sites: two in Penly, in the Seine-Maritime administrative department, two in Gravelines, in northern France, and two either in Bugey, in eastern France, or in Tricastin, in the south of France.",
            "However, EDF is currently undergoing a governance overhaul and full nationalisation. In August it issued a fifth profit warning for the year and now expects lower output to reduce its base earnings of €29 billion in 2022.",
            "Moreover, France's nuclear fleet has come under intense scrutiny, with a wave of plant repairs that forced a record number of reactors to shut down and sent nuclear power output to its lowest level since 30 years, seriously exacerbating Europe's energy crisis. Of the group's 56 reactors, 26 are currently shut down for maintenance reasons, corrosion problems or for refuelling.",
            "EDF executive director Cédric Lewandowski told the Economic Affairs Commission of the National Assembly on 14 September that, in theory, five should restart in September, five in October, seven in November, three in December, three in January and two in February. \"EDF is committed to restarting all shutdown reactors for this winter,\" Agnès Pannier-Runacher, Minister for Energy Transition, told the energy defence council on 2 September. However, most experts do not think this is feasible given the many problems facing EDF such as the prolonged and unplanned shutdown of four reactors on 25 August, for problems of corrosion.",
            "To carry out this plan, EDF’s new CEO, Luc Rémont, will have to tackle a shortage of skilled labour, which is contributing to delaying the revival of the nuclear fleet, Le Monde pointed out. Faced with a lack of industrial welders, pipefitters, machinists, and boilermakers, EDF will have to recruit workers in Romania, Portugal or elsewhere, and they will require 2-3 years of training.",
            "The EPR2 is a third-generation design produced by Framatome and EDF. It is an “optimised” version of the 1.7GWe EPR design, which has faced teething problems. The first two projects at Flamanville in Normandy and Olkiluoto in Finland both suffered lengthy delays and cost overruns. However, two other EPR reactors were completed at the Taishan plant in Guangdong, China, and entered service in 2018 and 2019.",

            "EDF said it would invest GBP1 billion ($1.1 billion) over 2023-25 to help UK plants to maintain output. “Our priority in the next few years is to deliver as much output as we safely can from the existing fleet, to support security of supply and help preserve the UK’s nuclear skills,” said Matt Sykes, Managing Director of EDF’s Generation business.",
            "Currently UK operating NPPs include four stations with ageing advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) at Heysham 1, Hartlepool, Torness and Heysham 2 as well as Sizewell B, which has a pressurised water reactor. Together these have a generating capacity of 5.5GWe. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool are due to close in 2024 and Torness and Heysham 2 by 2030. Three other stations with AGRs – Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B and Dungeness B have already closed and are being defuelled. Sizewell B is due to close in 2035. A new plant with EPR reactors is under construction at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.",
            "An EDF spokeswoman said: “In light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections, EDF will look to review the case for a short extension for Heysham 1 and Hartlepool Power Stations to generate beyond the current forecast of March 2024.”",
            "This came as part of a strategy update for EDF’s UK nuclear fleet in which it said the growing energy crisis in Europe had raised concerns about security of supply “with an increasing interest in nuclear power as a fundamental part of our energy mix to provide home-grown, dependably, zero-carbon supply”.",
            "EDF said closure dates for the four AGR stations “will be determined by the condition of the graphite making up the reactor cores, which is regularly inspected, and subject to rigorous assessment by the independent regulator. Inspections provide reassurance and allow us to meet external regulations. For example, our power stations are required to meet global earthquake regulations – this means we have to prove we can shut down the reactors during a major earthquake, a 1 in 10,000 year event – much larger than the UK has ever experienced or expects to happen.”",
            "According to EDF, nuclear output was forecast to be 42TWh for 2022, whis is some 5% above target. The investment of GBP1 billion will be for maintenance, inspections and plant upgrades to help sustain output for 2023 to 2025. EDF said it will review the case to extend generation at Hartlepool and Heysham \"within the next few months\".",
            "Discussions are also underway with the UK government on a voluntary pricing mechanism for nuclear output. EDF noted that power from nuclear had been \"delivered to the market at an average realised price which is significantly below current market prices\". Stressing the importance of price stability, it said the talks aim to agree a fair price to break the link between gas and electricity prices: \"The goal is to stabilise the price of power to customer at affordable levels, while supporting a fair return on investment for the generating fleet.\"",
            "As to the future, EDF said it would “help open up our sites for developments” to support the target of reaching 24GWe of nuclear capacity by 2050 and was working on a 20-year extension for Sizewell B. Life extension work began in April and involves Westinghouse, Jacobs, Framatome and Atkins. \"Work is progressing well to complete the Technical and Safety Review by the middle of 2023 with a final investment decision to be made by EDF in 2024.\"",
            "On the construction of Hinkley Point C EDF said some 74,000 people having worked on the project across the UK, with around 8000 people on site. EDF also said it will continue to work with the UK government on a similar NPP planned for Sizewell C and that a final investment decision is due next year. EDF is also looking at possible sites for small modular reactors including Heysham, while it considers Hartlepool to be \"the most suitable site in the UK\" for High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors which could produce heat and steam for industry.",

            "The Czech Republic has six commercially operational reactor units: four Russian designed VVER-440 units at Dukovany site, which began operation between 1985 and 1987, and two VVER-1000 units at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. Total installed nuclear capacity is 3934MWe accounting for 32.5% of electricity generation.",
            "TVEL (part of Rosatom) has long been the fuel supplier for both NPPs but from 2024 US-based Westinghouse and the French Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel. Dukovany currently has fuel supply for almost three years. \"According to the valid contract, another delivery from Russia should take place later this year,\" said plant director Roman Havlin.",
            "TVEL has been supplying Dukovany for almost 40 years and continues to develop fuel for the power plant's needs. \"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know,\" Havlín explained.",
            "Dana Drábová, chairwoman of the State Office for Nuclear Safety, said she did not expect it would be necessary to change fuel suppliers for the roughly 20 years of operation that remained for the Dukovany plant. She noted that TVEL produces fuel of excellent parameters. \"CEZ will have to come to terms with the fact that the fuel from the new supplier will not be optimised for performance, as was the case with the fuel from TVEL,\" said Drábová.",
            "As to maintenance, Havlin noted: \"We and our suppliers have 15,165 work orders and 47 major technical and investment actions to handle during the shutdown. It will be difficult, but we are prepared as much as possible.” As part of the shutdown, the power engineers will complete modernisation and optimisation the last cooling tower – No 8. ČEZ said this will increase production at Dukovany by around 15,539 MWh. Just a seemingly small reduction in the average temperature of the circulating cooling water by 0.35° C will increase the efficiency of the entire power plant, ČEZ explained. “These are not extremely large volumes, but a number of small measures ultimately have an effect,” said Bohdan Zronek, member of ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear power division.",

            "“Coupling BIM with GPS or location-aware Wifi networks enables the deployment of semi- or fully autonomous robotics systems and drones,” said Hannes Hanggi of the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, who helped lead the IAEA project. “They have the potential to significantly lower costs, further increase safety and enhance performance in decommissioning projects.”",
            "Lessons from Chornobyl and Fukushima",
            "how the Chornobyl and Fukushima accidents had influenced the use of robotic technology in  decommissioning. “In Ukraine, some years after the accident at unit 4 of the Chornobyl NPP in April 1986, research and development activity was carried out to develop a number of robotic techniques to be used for different purposes inside the damaged facility,” she noted. “Due to high exposure doses inside and the concentration of radioactive aerosols, an approach employing robotic techniques seemed very promising, for example, for characterisation of the premises and sampling of radioactive materials. It would mitigate doses for workers involved in stabilisation of the situation at the destroyed unit and help in planning further actions.”",
            "However, it soon became clear that there were challenges. Robots could not move due to the difficult configuration of surfaces – a lot of construction debris and no space for movement – and the extremely high exposure doses affected the electronic devices. Kilochytska added: “In cases where robotic devices stopped working or were stuck somewhere inside the unit, it was very difficult and sometime dangerous to bring them back. Some examples of these robots are still stored at Chornobyl.”",
            "Nevertheless, the use of robotic devices is now planned for use at Fukushima in Japan. Key to the development of robots for use at Fukushima is the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) that was created as a matter of urgency in 2013 to upgrade and develop decommissioning technology for the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. This has included development, testing and use of a range of robots for different purposes (see box).",
            "In addition, US-based Jacobs, for instance, has designed and built a robotic tool to obtain crucial information about the damaged reactor. It will collect pebble-like debris from the bottom of the containment vessel. A prototype passed extremely demanding factory acceptance and performance tests from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which is leading the project. It is expected that a radiation resistant version will be built for deployment. “This is a prime example of how we are combining innovative engineering and deep nuclear knowledge to help decommissioning agencies meet the challenge of transforming legacy sites into a safe end state,” said Jacobs Energy, Security & Technology Senior Vice President Karen Wiemelt.",
            "The robot had to be small enough to enter the damaged containment vessel and pick up sand and pebbles up to 10mm in size by deploying a bucket-style retrieval device.",
            "The exact nature of the debris is currently unknown, and examination of the retrieved debris samples will provide crucial data for the next steps in decommissioning.",
            "Trials have shown that a remote operator, guided by images from a built-in camera, will need no more than eight minutes to insert the device into the containment vessel and retrieve debris samples, thus minimising the impact of radiation damage on the device.",
            "“The government of Japan and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) plan to conduct test retrieval of fuel debris from inside the unit 2 reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP by the end of 2022,” Kilochytska said. “To this end, TEPCO has been working with the UK to build a robotic arm, which has already arrived in Japan. The robotic arm is currently undergoing evaluation testing, and as soon as that is completed, it will be placed in a mock-up facility for debris retrieval training. In addition, various remote-control devices are being used to monitor the situation in high-dose areas such as inside nuclear reactors.”",
            "Retrieving fuel debris is the most challenging part of decommissioning efforts at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, according to Tadahiro Washiya of the Division of Fuel Debris Handling, Collaborative Laboratories for Advanced Decommissioning Science (CLADS) at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. “An investigation of the damaged unit 1 [F1] was carried out by robots and remote inspection tools; however, there are many uncertainties in understanding the conditions of the fuel debris,” including its composition and mechanical properties, Washiya said.",
            "Knowledge gained from the 1986 accident at Chornobyl is already supporting efforts at Fukushima Daiichi, said Boris Burakov of the Khlopin Radium Institute in St Peterburg, Russia, which hosted a training seminar with Japanese experts using real Chornobyl fuel debris samples in October 2019. “The results of the material study of Chornobyl samples are very important for predicting the main properties of the fuel debris at Fukushima Daiichi F1,” as the fuel debris at both sites share several similarities, Burakov said. Similarities include lava-like materials, porous fuel produced by this lava contacting water and hot particles with fuel and corium matrices.",
            "New approaches to the use of robots",
            "With so many NPPs scheduled to close in the coming decades, the nuclear industry will need more professionals working in decommissioning. To attract new talent to the field, in 2020 the IAEA held a global crowdsourcing challenge that sought original concepts or project outlines from young people for advancing the decommissioning of nuclear facilities or environmental remediation of radiologically contaminated sites. Entries included characterisation toolkits, instruments for field measurements and collecting 3D radiation data, as well as robots and artificial intelligence.",
            "A total of 26 submissions from 12 countries were received and evaluated against criteria such as the level of innovation and creativity. Of the five best entries selected by the IAEA, several relied on robotics. For example, Zeni Anggraini from the National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN) led a team that came up with a concept of a robot for mapping and monitoring of contaminated areas. “So far, measuring of contamination has been limited to a small area and was done manually,” he said. “We want to make a robot that can be used to avoid potential radiation risks to staff. There needs to be a breakthrough in the method of radiation monitoring using robots to measure and visualise contamination in affected areas.”",
            "Another proposal featuring robots came from the USA. “With the nuclear industry growing, the need for new subject matter experts is in high demand. As technology increases throughout our lifetime so does the need for experts in these fields, for example robotics,” said Daniel Martin, a research assistant at the Florida International University in the USA, whose team’s proposal envisaged use of a robotic platform and artificial intelligence to aid in preventing defects before they occur in facilities to be dismantled.",
            "Meanwhile, Erin Holland, a PhD student from the University of Bristol in the UK, led a team that submitted a characterisation toolkit for accelerated decommissioning activities. “Nuclear robotics is a fast-growing discipline and physical demonstrations of advanced robotic systems help make nuclear decommissioning quicker and safer for human operators,” said Holland. He added: “The overall aim of this project is to make a legacy site, formerly used for uranium and thorium ore processing, safer for the civilians working there.”",
            "Sellafield, the UK’s largest nuclear site and the focus of its nuclear decommissioning efforts, is making increasing use of robots. Spot the robot dog made its debut on the Sellafield site in October 2021 with three days of successful trials and a shift within an active area. Sellafield’s remediation teams are leading Spot’s deployment for Sellafield Ltd, working with Cumbria-based engineering consultant Createc, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and its US manufacturers Boston Dynamics.",
            "Valuable information was collected through laser scanning and gamma radiation imaging using a system provided by Createc. The robot completed its work wearing a suit specially designed and manufactured at the UKAEA which protected it from any radioactive contamination.",
            "Chris Hope, remediation capability development manager, Sellafield Ltd said: “This was a really challenging task – we deployed Spot into a complex, cluttered, highly contaminated area with a mission to capture information. The quality of the data we captured is fantastic and will help us with our decommissioning and waste planning.”",
            "He added: “Until now, this type of survey has relied on our operators manually deploying equipment in hazardous environments wearing full protective equipment. This proves that Spot can help us take humans away from harm. This allows us to free up our workers to deliver other value adding work. The protective suit did its job too – the robot was monitored and cleared by our health physics team, and was able to leave the Sellafield site.”",
            "Elsewhere in the UK, this year saw Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) begin working with the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear (RAIN) Hub to develop a second-generation robot called Lyra. It includes a package of surveying measures including LIDAR, multiple angle cameras, radiation probes and the ability to take swabs using the manipulator arm.",
            "In February, the robot completed a survey of a 140-metre-long underfloor duct which runs under the central corridor between laboratories, providing useful information that will help decommissioning.",
            "“Now the characterisation survey is complete we have built up a very comprehensive picture of the duct, which will help us make informed decisions on how the duct should be decommissioned,” said DSRL Project Manager Jason Simpson.",
            "OC Robotics flexible snake-arm robot has been deployed to help decommission the Dragon reactor at Winfrith in the UK using its high-powered cutting laser. Passing through a narrow hole in the 3 metre-thick concrete around the core, it sliced through a 400mm diameter Purge Gas Pre-Cooler (PGPC) vessel attached to the reactor core. Developed by OC Robotics and TWI with R&D funding from the NDA, LaserSnake allowed the work to be carried out inside the existing radiation shielding, saving time and money.",
            "Magnox Senior Project Manager, Andy Philps said: “We believe this is the first time that laser-cutting technology has been deployed directly on the core of a nuclear reactor.”",
            "In 2021, Framatome confirmed the operation of robotic systems for handling and sorting high-dose waste components, paving the way for increasing automation.",
            "The Virtual Remote Robotics (VIRERO) project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, develops technologies for dismantling and sorting high-dose operational wastes, post-conditioning of packaged radioactive waste, and radiological sorting for handling, storage and disposal. The VIRERO project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.",
            "According to Kilochytska, for the time being, many remotely-controlled devices can be used for characterisation of surfaces during decommissioning, for dismantling structures, systems and components that may be radioactively contaminated. “Moreover, robotic techniques such as drones can investigate the radiological situation and measure levels of contamination inside the premises and rooms,” she told",
            ". “In this way, doses to workers can be avoided and time and money needed for conducting these actions, for example, characterisation or dismantling, can be decreased. Together with 3D modelling this makes it possible to create a full picture of a particular room or facility, making planning of further activities easier, taking into account dose rates and levels of contamination.”",
            "She noted some important points for the future use of robotic techniques. “First, it is necessary to assess real needs and potential benefits, taking into account a particular plan for decommissioning a particular facility. Usually, development of such techniques requires significant investment. In addition, the further use of devices requires maintenance costs to support operation and repairs, as needed, such as a qualified staff to do this.” She added that there may also be an issue with decontamination of such devices to make possible regular use. “All this should be considered in advance before any decision is taken about developing or buying devices.”",
            "It is clear that robotics and other digital tools are playing an increasingly important role in advancing nuclear decommissioning projects, not only by enabling experts to characterise environments and decommissioning challenges but also by improving their execution. As Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy, said: “Innovative digital technologies can provide crucial insights for the planning and implementation of decommissioning projects. They can provide support in decommissioning situations that are difficult or dangerous for human workers and can help ensure that projects are executed safely and effectively”.",

            "The International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) comprises 18 specialist research and development companies and organisations. These comprise:",
            "Two national research and development agencies: Japan Atomic Energy Agency and National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.",
            "Four plant manufacturers: Toshiba Energy Systems & Solutions Corporation; Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy Ltd; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd; and ATOX Co Ltd.",
            "Twelve electric utility companies: Hokkaido Electric Power Co; Tohoku Electric Power Co; Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) Holdings; Chubu Electric Power Co; Hokuriku Electric Power Co; Kansai Electric Power Company; Chugoku Electric Power Co; Shikoku Electric Power Company; Kyushu Electric Power Company; Japan Atomic Power Company; Electric Power Development Co Ltd.; and Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd.",
            "Many areas of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP are still too dangerous for humans to enter due to high radiation levels, and robots are being used to perform some of the decommissioning work. IRID has developed robots to investigate conditions inside the Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) and the spread of fuel debris.",
            "Various types of robots have been introduced. Two of the earliest ones – Rosemary and Sakura – worked together inside the unit 1 reactor building inspecting radioactive sources. Both robots were developed by the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT) in Narashino. IRID (Hitachi-GE) later modified them to investigate dose rates inside the building.",
            "Rosemary is equipped with a gamma camera (N-Visage) made in the UK to detect radiation dosage rates. Rosemary operates this camera via a wireless system as it is not large enough to be equipped with communication cables. However, as wireless communication is difficult to maintain inside the building. Sakura supports Rosemary acting as a wireless transmission station.",
            "In 2014, MHI tested the MEISTeR (maintenance equipment integrated system of telecontrol) robot which subsequently completed decontamination work and concrete core sampling at units 1&2. MEISTeR is capable of concrete drilling, cutting of handrails and piping, removal of obstacles, decontamination, repair work, and so on. The core samples were collected using the core boring apparatus equipped on one of MEISTeR’s arms, and a chisel on the other.",
            "Also in 2014, a swimming robot and a crawling robot, both developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy performed condition checks and a flow detection survey inside the unit 2 torus room wall. The robot swam underwater, using a camera to inspect the penetration points and checking for flow using a tracer while the crawling robot measured and monitored the flow of the tracer using an ultrasonic sonar system.",
            "The following year surveys were conducted at the unit 1 PCV using two shape-changing robots developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy.",
            "Many modifications and improvements were made by the development team to enable the robots to withstand the high-radiation environment within the reactor. The shape-changing robot first takes on a tubular form to traverse narrow pipes in order to reach the inside of the containment vessel. Subsequently. to achieve stability, the robot forms a U-shape as it collects the necessary information about the conditions inside the containment vessel."

            "Koeberg unit 1 began construction in 1976 and commercial operations begin in July 1984. (Credit: Pipodesign Philipp P Egli/Wikipedia.org)",
            "Deep rolling blackouts that have hit South Africa have prompted a reappraisal of the repair, refurbishment and maintenance programme at South Africa’s only operating nuclear power plant, Koeberg near Cape Town. The two-unit facility supplies some 5% of the nation’s electricity and they are currently the only operating reactors in South Africa as well as the African continent. While the nuclear units play a significant role in maintaining grid stability, since the start of the year only a single unit, or half the capacity, has been operating.",
            "Both Koeberg 1 and 2 are PWRs. Unit 1 began construction in 1976 and commercial operations begin in July 1984. Construction on Unit 2 also began in 1976 but commercial operations didn’t begin until just about a year later than unit 1, in November 1985. Units 1 and 2 have net capacities of 924 MWe and 930 MWe, respectively. The state-owned power utility Eskom is responsible for operating the reactors as well as maintaining them and this year both are due to be shut down as part of a planned repair and maintenance programme.",
            "The planned outage of unit 2, the 25th refuelling outage since commissioning, began on 18 January and originally had been anticipated as an outage lasting 155 days. This maintenance programme also included the replacement of the unit’s three steam generators and reactor pressure vessel head, which houses the reactor’s nuclear fuel.",
            "In March though, the company announced that, prior to the start of any irreversible work, Eskom and the main contractor Framatome (now Areva) performed a final review to ensure that the steam generator replacement work would be completed in a timely way while ensuring the quality levels of the work. However, the review concluded that there was a significant likelihood that the unit would not be returned to service before the peak demand winter season, exacerbating the challenges faced by an already constrained grid.",
            "“Before we start cutting pipes, we conducted a final review to ensure that the steam generator replacement work would be completed at the expected quality levels and in accordance with the outage schedule. It was just too risky to continue with this work,” Jan Oberholzer, Eskom’s Chief Operating Officer, explained in a statement.",
            "With the chance that the reactor may returned to the service later than the planned-for June 2022 and the severe impact on consumers and businesses if that was the case, a decision was taken to delay the steam generator element of the refurbishment until the following refuelling outage. This is currently planned for August 2023. Eskom insists that these deferred tasks in no way affect the safe operations of the plant as the steam generators undergo a full series of inspections and integrity tests as part of the standard refuelling outage. As Riedewaan Barkadien, Eskom’s Chief Nuclear Officer, later explained: “We have moved the replacement of the generators into a window that suits Eskom better”.",
            "While the first phase of the current outage proceeded as planned, including replacement of fuel and scheduled maintenance, the latest delay to the project is the second to be recently announced. Eskom laid the delays at the door of the global pandemic, which hampered the ability of the company to get resources to the site. Work on Unit 2 had initially been set for completion by mid-June. CEO André de Ruyter has said the work would now be finalised by the end of July, as NEI goes to press. Unit 2 had produced electricity for 454 days without interruption ahead of the January refuelling and maintenance shutdown.",
            "Each weighing about 380 tonnes and some 20 metres long, the steam generator replacement is an important part of a US$1.2bn longer-term programme to extend the operational life of the plant’s reactors by 20 years each. The original generators feature U-tubes that are susceptible to cracking. Once removed they will temporarily stored on-site, before final disposal at the Vaalputs radioactive waste storage facility in the Northern Cape “as complete and sealed units”. It has been reported that the on-site facilities to store the old steam generators are not ready, which is one of the reasons for the changing schedule.",
            "While the delay will not materially impact the life extension plan it does narrow the available window to complete the work. Koeberg’s current operating licences expire in 2024 for Unit 1 and 2025 for Unit 2. Steam generator replacement at both units is one of the upgrades required by the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) to grant an extension to the operating licence. The Koeberg Long-Term Operation (LTO) plan is a series of activities that will enable Koeberg to operate to 2045. The plans are to be submitted along with supporting documentation to the NNR for evaluation and Eskom had planned to submit the required supporting documentation by June 2022.",
            "As part of the review of the Koeberg LTO programme, an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 10-person team carried out a safety aspects of the LTO (SALTO) review during March 2022. “We observed that despite many challenges the plant has made progress in ageing management activities and preparation for safe LTO since the first Pre-SALTO mission in 2015,” said team leader Gabor Petofi, a Senior Nuclear Safety Officer at the IAEA. Koeberg management has also requested the IAEA schedule a follow-up mission to Koeberg during 2024.",
            "“Eskom has incorporated some IAEA standards and guides into its policies and procedures, with a robust framework having been put in place for the life extension,” said Barkadien.",
            "In a statement Katse Maphoto, Chief Director: Nuclear Safety and Technology of the Department of Minerals and Energy in South Africa, emphasised the importance of Koeberg LTO from national energy security and grid balancing perspective: “The government remains optimistic that the LTO project will benefit a lot from the IAEA mission recommendations for the power station to achieve the highest level of safety.” The South African government has previously indicated a strong commitment to the future of nuclear energy. Alongside the Koeberg LTO in October 2019 the country outlined plans to build 1 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2030.",
            "Koeberg unit 1 is currently scheduled to shut down for its annual refuel and maintenance programme in September and the steam generator replacement on this unit will proceed as planned from October 2022. This is after the winter peak and is planned as a similar 155-day outage. Its reactor pressure vessel head had already been replaced several years ago.",
            "Areva was the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for Koeberg and in August 2014, Eskom awarded Areva the steam generator replacement contract in a ZAR 4.3bn (US$258m) contract that was later challenged in court by Westinghouse. The installation of the replacement steam generators was originally scheduled to begin in 2018. Three of the steam generators have already been completely built and the remaining three are progressing well, Eskom says.",
            "In August last year, US-based Jacobs announced it had been selected to carry out essential engineering modifications in preparation for the installation of the six replacement steam generators. Jacobs is responsible for construction management related to modifications to the secondary steam turbine system. The scope of work includes prefabrication of piping, pipe supports and modification, and piping replacement; installation of on- site scaffolding, rigging and lagging; vessel modifications and strengthening; and replacement of forced air cooler units. About 12.6 tonnes of asbestos roof sheets and 14.1 tonnes of structural steelwork were safely removed ahead of schedule.",
            "“This project is vital to maintain the pivotal role of nuclear power in South Africa’s energy mix,” said Jacobs Energy Security and Technology Senior Vice President Karen Wiemelt, who added: “We also created a new design to install an independent seal cooling system with an independent power supply system.”",
            "In March 2017 Canada-based L3 MAPPS won a contract to upgrade two simulators at Koeberg, taking into account the changes that the new steam generators will make to the plant performance. The two simulators will switch from PC/Linux simulation servers to PC/Windows-based computers running its latest Orchid simulation environment. The reactor core model will also be replaced. In 2013, L3 MAPPS completed work to upgrade the plant’s original simulator and also commissioned the second full-scope simulator at the site. That work was carried out under contracts signed in 2009.",
            "Meanwhile, in July, it was announced that Barkadien had tendered his resignation and is to join a Canadian nuclear utility after 26 years at Eskom. A previous Koeberg Station Manager, Keith Featherstone, will be acting in the Chief Nuclear Officer role while a replacement for Barkadien is recruited. “As the only nuclear power station in Africa, we have all played a role in keeping the plant safe, and the best place to work. The decision to resign was, therefore, by no means an easy decision,” said Barkadien.",
            "In a related development, the current acting Station General Manager, Nomawethu Mtwebana, is to temporarily join the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) after the completion of the current outage of Unit 2. Mahesh Valaitham, will become Koeberg’s acting General Manager.",
            "Returning Koeberg 2 to service will help reduce pressure on the rest of the Eskom generation fleet and will mitigate the risk of further load shedding over the winter period. The increase in load shedding came on the back of higher levels of unplanned plant breakdowns, which averaged 26% of the fleet in the period ended March 2022. During this period the energy availability factor (EAF) averaged 62%.",
            "“Planned maintenance is Eskom’s only weapon to try bring reliability and predictability to a neglected plant,” Eskom’s Oberholzer said, emphasising the challenge of maintaining its large generation fleet. Indeed, during the summer months around 12% of the total generation capacity had been taken offline for planned maintenance in preparation for the peak demand winter period.",
            "The return to service of Koeberg 2 will add 930 MWe of much needed power to the South African Power system, reducing pressure on the transmission grid and limiting the need for load shedding. Until then Eskom has urged South African residents to use electricity “sparingly” especially during the morning and evening peaks, when capacity constraints require it to implement load shedding as a “last resort” to protect the national grid. Despite such measures to conserve power, due to low plant availability from 1 January to 10 May this year, load shedding has been implemented for 32 days, six more than the 26 days of load shedding that occurred during the same period in 2021."

            "Angra 3 was planned in the 1980s but work stopped due to lack of finance. Construction resumed in 2010, but nuclear utility Eletronuclear (a subsidiary of Eletrobras) faced a corruption scandal in 2015 and stopped paying contractors, including French company Areva, which was installing the Siemens-designed reactor technology now owned by Framatome.",
            "Angra 3 is 67% complete and 80% of the nuclear reactor equipment has been bought and is being stored, costing Eletronuclear BRL25 million ($5m) a year on upkeep and insurance for the construction site. This excludes interest payments on BRL10 billion in loans from national development bank BNDES to build Angra 3.",
            "BNDES said in June 2021 it had hired a consortium to structure the Angra 3 completion project. Contracting of the Angra Eurobras NES consortium – Tractebel Engineering Ltda, Tractebel Engineering SA and Grouped Entrepreneurs International SA – is part of the technical services that BNDES has been providing Eletronuclear since 2019.",
            "In order to obtain the installation licence, which is valid for six years, Eletronuclear satisfied some criteria to prove to Ibama that it is meeting its commitments, such as controlling noise levels, correct disposal of waste, investment in worker safety and in the Angra NPP emergency plan. In addition, there are investments in social projects, such as health, education, basic sanitation and security programmes for the region.",
            "In February, Eletronuclear signed a contract with the consortium formed by Ferreira Guedes, Matricial and ADtranz, which will resume the civil works of the plant and will assist in the electromechanical assembly. At the moment, the consortium is in the process of preparing the construction site for construction of the plant to restart. Currently Angra 3 is scheduled to begin operation in February 2028.",
            "Currently, Brazil has two nuclear power plants in operation, both in Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde, in Rio de Janeiro. Angra 1 and Angra 2, a total of 1.9GWe, generate 1.1% of the energy of the Brazilian Interconnected System (SIN). Angra 3 will add 1.4GWe for a total of 3.3GWe, which will account for only 1.5% of Brazil’s total energy delivery capacity. Eletronuclear says Angra 3 will generate the equivalent of 50% of the consumption of the State of Rio de Janeiro.",

            "Unit 1 at China’s Taishan NPP in Guangdong province – the world's first operating EPR reactor – has been reconnected to the grid, China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) said in a stock exchange filing on 16 August. Operators reconnected the damaged reactor after months of “inspection and maintenance”, CGN said. “The monitoring results of Taishan Nuclear Power Plant and its surrounding environment are normal.”",
            "In July 2021, CGN shut down Taishan 1 to replace damaged fuel rods after an increase in radiation levels had been detected in the primary circuit at the unit. The increase was caused by damage to the cladding in a small number of fuel rods, which is normal during the production, transportation and loading of fuel, China's Ministry of Ecology & Environment (MEE) noted. It estimated that around five of more than 60,000 fuel rods in the Taishan 1 reactor core had been damaged. However, CGN closed the unit to investigate the cause of the damage.",
            "Construction of Taishan 1 began in 2009, followed by unit 2 in 2010. The 1750MWe EPRs began commercial operation in December 2018 and September 2019. The plant is owned by Taishan Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company Limited (TNPJVC) – a joint venture between CGN (51%), French utility EDF (30%) and the Chinese utility Guangdong Energy Group (19%).",
            "Following an inspection of Taishan 1 between 26 and 29 July, China's National Nuclear Safety Administration (NNSA) gave its approval for the reactor to be restarted. EDF on 17 August confirmed that the reactor had resumed production. “After an in-depth investigation, the Chinese safety authority gave its agreement for the restart of the EPR reactor 1 at Taishan,” an EDF spokeswoman said.",
            "However, in July, Energy Live News (ELN) reported that EDF was making design changes at the UK’s Hinkley Point C NPP in view of the problems at Taishan. A Hinkley Point C spokesperson told ELN: “The issue with fuel assemblies at Taishan has been investigated and is understood. A detailed solution has been identified by Framatome and will be implemented for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. We are confident that this will be effective as it is based on a detailed understanding of the issue and operational experience at existing power stations, including Sizewell B in Britain.”",
            "The spokesperson continued: “The proposed solution is also in operation at Olkiluoto 3 in Finland which has a different fuel design to Taishan. As a prudent operator, we will investigate all potential alternative mitigations and share that information with the nuclear regulator.”",
            "An Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) spokesperson told ELN: “We have been in regular contact with the French, Finnish and Chinese regulators on the Taishan fuel failure issue during the past year. The knowledge gained will be used to help inform our regulation of nuclear plants in the UK, like Hinkley Point C, where the EPR reactor will be installed.",
            "The ONR spokesperson added: “As we would expect, all options are being considered by the Hinkley Point C project to address the operational experience from Taishan and any proposals will be rigorously assessed by ourselves in due course. We are content that there remains sufficient time to address any potential learning from Taishan and fuel is not expected to be delivered to the Hinkley Point C site for several years.”",

        "text": [
            "South Africa’s National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) has confirmed that power utility Eskom had submitted the safety case in support of its application to extend the operational life of the Koeberg NPP beyond the current 40-year licence term. The two 970MWe pressurised water reactors at Koeberg NPP were built by Framatome, and began commercial operation in 1984 and 1985. They generate about 5% of the South Africa’s electricity.",
            "That application was submitted by Eskom in May 2021 and accepted by NNR for further processing in August 2021. NNR’s Orion Phillips, Divisional Executive Nuclear Power Plant, confirmed that the safety case was submitted on 21 July 2022. NNR said this is within the prescribed timelines and provides adequate time for the regulator to assess the safety case and for the Operator to respond to requests for more information as and when needed.",
            "Eskom is in the process of finalising the Public Information Document (PID) and will have to publish both the application and the PID in the government gazette, newspapers and to serve notices to interested and affected parties. “We are beginning a process of robust scrutiny of the safety case on which we will report our progress and findings, including public comments received in a Safety Evaluation Report to the NNR Board of Directors,” said Peter Bester, Programme Manager Nuclear Power Plant.",
            "However, some civil society organisations and experts believed the worrying culture of secrecy around Koeberg was unacceptable and that the entire safety case should be made public – not just the PID. Cape Argus reported.",
            "Energy analyst professor Hartmut Winkler, a physicist at the University of Johannesburg, said civil society and the public were correct in demanding greater transparency and full information regarding the nuclear plant.",
            "On 28 July Cape Argus’s Kristin Engel submitted a number of questions to NNR for clarification. He asked: “What are some of the key insights of the safety case for the application to extend the operating life of the Koeberg?” NNR said the regulator takes several factors into consideration when assessing the safety case for this application. “Some of the key insights include but are not limited to;",
            "• A safety justification • Compliance with the Regulator’s principal safety criteria • The application of Defence-in-Depth of the NPP • The Radiological Risks connected with the application • Ageing management improvements and risks • Reviewing the adequacy of the design for extended operation and the confirmation and verification of the design basis • A detailed assessment of safety-related programmes such as Emergency planning and environmental impacts • A Periodic Safety Assessment covering relevant Safety Factors • Plant improvements needed for extended operations.”",
            "Engel said some civil society organisations had called for the safety case to be made public- not just PID as they say public participation cannot be meaningful if information relevant to the issue is hidden. He asked whether NNR would consider sharing the safety case. NNR said: “The safety case submitted with this application belongs to a third party which is Eskom. Civil Society organisations can submit a request to Eskom for a copy of the safety case.”",
            "Engel also asked whether the extension of Koeberg was essential to resolve South Africa’s electricity crisis. NNR said its mandate “is confined to ensuring that the regulatory framework for nuclear safety is established, enforced, and maintained for the protection of persons and the environment”, adding that Eskom is better placed to answer this question.",
            "In March, the Long Term Operation (LTO) plan for Koeberg was reviewed by an International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA's) Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation (SALTO) team at the request of South Africa's Department of Mineral Resources and Energy.",
            "Team leader Gabor Petofi, senior nuclear safety officer at the IAEA, said staff were \"professional, open and receptive to suggestions for improvement – despite challenges, the plant has eliminated several deviations from IAEA Safety Standards in ageing management activities and preparation for safe LTO identified during the Pre-SALTO mission in 2019.\"",
            "The team identified good practices that could be shared with the industry globally, such as integrating a corrective action programme to extensively consider operating experience for LTO and using a template to collect information from the original equipment manufacturers to establish the extended qualified life of electrical components.",
            "The team also provided recommendations and suggestions to further enhance the preparations for safe LTO, including that Eskom should comprehensively review and implement all plant programmes relevant for LTO; complete the revalidation of qualification of cables in the containment for the long term operation period; and ensure full functionality of the containment structure monitoring system.",
            "Koeberg plant management said it was committed to implement the recommendations and requested that the IAEA schedule a SALTO follow-up mission to Koeberg in 2024. The team provided a draft report to the plant management and NNR for comments and said a final report would be submitted to plant management, NNR and the Government of South Africa within three months.",

            "Westinghouse Electric Company have announced a partnership with EDF to explore the functionalities of Westinghouse’s EnCore enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) technology. Westinghouse will study its EnCore fuel in an EDF reactor for potential deployment across the EDF nuclear fleet after 2030. This will be the largest R&D programme on enhanced fuel that Westinghouse has conducted in Europe to date.",
            "Westinghouse will deliver assemblies with Lead Test Rods (LTR) to EDF from its fuel fabrication facility in Västerås, Sweden by 2023. The initiative includes the licensing, qualification, fabrication, delivery and operation of the LTR in an EDF 1300 MWe reactor. Westinghouse also will conduct a post-irradiation exam to verify the enhanced accident tolerance features in EDF’s reactors under operating conditions.",
            "“Westinghouse is a pioneer in the industry‐wide ATF initiative, with programmes delivered to US and European customers in 2019 and 2020. We are delighted to collaborate with EDF in this development programme and highly value EDF’s proactiveness and engagement in this critical, long-term effort,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel.",
            "Westinghouse, Framatome and GE Hitachi with GNF are all working with the US Department of Energy (DOE) to develop new fuels under its Accident Tolerant Fuel Programme. DOE supports these companies by providing irradiation and safety testing, as well as with advanced modelling and simulation, to help qualify their fuels with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).",
            "As part of the programme, lead test rods containing Westinghouse's EnCore fuel technology were loaded into unit 2 at Exelon's Byron NPP in Illinois in the spring of 2019. These were removed after completing their operating cycle during a scheduled outage in the 2020. Post-irradiation testing of the fuel is being carried out by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to help qualify it with the NRC. Westinghouse is testing a chromium-coated zirconium alloy cladding that is loaded with their ADOPT higher density uranium fuel pellets. The programme is receiving support from Idaho National Laboratory and ORNL to provide utilities with longer operation times, increased power outputs and higher fuel burnup. Lead test assemblies of EnCore ATF were also installed in Engie Electrabel's Doel unit 4 in Belgium in 2020.",
            "GE has developed IronClad fuel with support from DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It uses a combination of iron, chromium and aluminium for its fuel cladding to improve the fuel’s behaviour under extremely high temperatures. The steel material is intended to have a lower oxidation rate when exposed to high temperature steam, improving the safety margins over zirconium cladding currently in use. GE is also testing a second fuel and cladding concept known as ARMOR. This coated zirconium cladding was developed outside of the DOE programme but is now an integral part of it. Southern Nuclear installed GE-Hitachi ATF fuel cladding technologies in 2018 at unit 1 of the Hatch NPP with samples discharged and shipped to ORNL for further testing in 2020.",
            "Framatome is testing chromium-coated cladding and chromia-doped fuel pellets. The special coating is designed to protect the fuel cladding from damage and oxidation at higher temperatures. The new fuel pellet mixture of chromium oxide and uranium oxide powders is expected to help the pellet last longer and perform better at high temperatures. In 2019, unit 2 at the US Vogtle NPP installed four Framatome-developed GAIA lead fuel assemblies containing accident-tolerant features applied to full-length fuel rods.",
