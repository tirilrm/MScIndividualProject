            "London-based Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said the government is “absolutely right to pursue more large-scale nuclear alongside the small modular reactor programme” because it is “proven technology that delivers clean, sovereign power and can transform communities with thousands of high-quality, long-term jobs and apprenticeships”.",
            "He said: “Wylfa is the best site in Europe for a big nuclear project: it has an existing grid connection, the hard bedrock ideal for a nuclear power station, superior cooling water access, and some work to clear the site for large-scale construction was already done by the previous developer.”",
            "Greatrex said “the community there has a strong nuclear heritage, and there is local interest in a new project” adding that “the people of the island deserve clarity and certainty on the project’s future, and so we welcome the government’s engagement with potential partners internationally”.",
            "He said: “We urge [the government] to move forward at pace and to set out how it will choose a delivery partner and how they will fund a new project as soon as practical.  ",

            "Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said the government was “powering ahead with the biggest expansion of nuclear energy in 70 years”.",
            "Coutinho said: “Anglesey has a proud nuclear history and it is only right that, once again, it can play a central role in boosting the UK’s energy security. Wylfa would not only bring clean, reliable power to millions of homes – it could create thousands of well-paid jobs and bring investment to the whole of north Wales.”",
            "In 2020, Hitachi, which owned the site until it was bought by Great British Nuclear (GBN), pulled out of a plan to build a nuclear station on the site. The Japanese company blamed a lack of funding from the UK government. ",

            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",

            "The UK should consider a range of technologies for future large-scale nuclear power plants as it seeks to revive the sector, according to the top official overseeing those efforts. ",
            "Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Nuclear, the public body responsible for the delivery of new projects, told the Financial Times the UK would need “at least another couple” of large nuclear power stations after the two EPR plants currently under construction by French state-owned power company EDF at Hinkley Point C. ",
            "The French utility is also jointly developing plans with the British government to build a second station using the EPR design at Sizewell in Suffolk.",
            "But Bowen added that a pause was needed before the UK decided on what technology to use in those future large plants, which will form part of the country’s drive to meet its net zero goals. ",
            "“I think from a value-for-money perspective, we’ve got to pause and look and just check that we’ve got our strategy right,” he said. ",
            "Bowen said other technologies worth considering included Westinghouse’s AP1000 plant, which has already been through the UK regulatory process, as well as South Korea’s APR-1400 and Canadian Candu designs. He acknowledged that as the UK was building two EPR-based plants there was a good case for using the same design.",
            "In January, the UK government set out plans for what it claimed will be Britain’s biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years with the possible construction of about 11 new reactors by 2050 – enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand.",
            "Ministers published a roadmap that recommitted the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24 GW by 2050 – an increase from around 5.8 GW today.",
            "The government is also running a competition for companies to design and build small modular reactors. In October it selected six companies to advance to the next phase of the competition. The companies are: EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK.",

            "Germany’s nuclear phaseout has led to a significant contraction of its nuclear power plant and services sector, but the industry is aiming to show it has a long-term future by turning to international markets while also targeting activities at home that could be worth up to €1bn ($1.08bn) per reactor, Berlin-based industry group KernD told NucNet.",
            "It is hardly surprising Germany is looking for a slice of the decommissioning pie. According to a 2022 study by EY-Parthenon, Ernst & Young’s strategy consulting arm, the global nuclear decommissioning market is worth an estimated $125bn (€115bn) to $135bn from 2021 to 2050.",
            "EY-Parthenon identifies those countries that will contribute most to the evolving market in nuclear decommissioning.",
            "Japan is top, with a decommissioning market value of around $40bn, followed by the US at $32bn and the UK at $24bn. France follows at $8bn and Germany at around $6bn. Together, these countries, which implemented the most ambitious nuclear programmes throughout the 1970s and 1980s, make up more than 80% of the global market.",
            "Almost all of these countries are at the start of their nuclear decommissioning programmes. Germany is the exception. Its decommissioning process will be completed sooner, by 2050, due to “an early political” decision to exit from nuclear and transition to renewables in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima disaster, EY-Parthenon said.",

            "The German Institute for Economic Research said in a paper that dismantling activities in Germany could be worth up to €1bn per reactor.",
            "Germany has still got “a broad capacity of nuclear capabilities available that can cover the areas of new build, service and maintenance, fuel, long-term operation and safety upgrades, decommissioning and waste management”, KernD chairman Thomas Seipolt told NucNet.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important [nuclear power] business within Germany,” Seipolt said.",
            "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has also pointed to the significance of the nuclear decommissioning market. As many nuclear plants near the end of their life cycle, a new industry based around decommissioning nuclear facilities is emerging. ",
            "In addition to nuclear plants themselves, many other facilities involved in the nuclear fuel cycle, such as research centres and facilities for reprocessing spent fuel or for waste treatment, will need to be decommissioned. ",
            "In total, it is likely that several hundred billion dollars will be spent on decommissioning worldwide between now and 2050, and businesses and investors are already securing their positions, the IAEA said.",
            "There are 420 nuclear power reactors in operation around the world, according to the IAEA. Around 200 are expected to begin the decommissioning process by 2050. ",
            "Orano, the France-based multinational nuclear company that has an office in Frankfurt, has said the German government’s decision to abandon nuclear power will generate significant business in the reactor dismantling sector over the coming years, with the majority of contracts already being allocated.",
            "KernD spokesperson Nicolas Wendler said the industry has been “reorienting towards international markets”. ",
            "KernD admits Germany is often perceived as synonymous with criticism of nuclear energy. What is often overlooked is that it has built up a portfolio of expertise in nuclear energy and nuclear technology that is largely still available today. Nuclear research began in Germany in the 1950s and until March 2011 it generated one-quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy with 17 reactors.",
            "According to KernD, Germany’s expertise in decommissioning has expanded in recent years with key players able to handle the entire portfolio of dismantling and decontamination services. Major companies such as Framatome, Westinghouse and Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service (GNS) are supported by numerous specialist companies that offer radiation protection, the operation of waste processing centres and documentation services. ",
            "“The fact that most European countries that use nuclear energy have abandoned phaseout policies and are continuing to extend the lifetimes of nuclear power plants means that this business area can continue to exist for quite a long time,” KernD said. ",
            "Almost one year ago, in April 2023, Germany took its last three nuclear reactors offline  in a decision that critics warned would only lead to more fossil fuels being burned to generate electricity. ",
            "Since the shutdowns, three political parties have called for a reversal of the anti-nuclear policy with leading members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) saying they want to restart decommissioned reactors and build new ones. ",
            "CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a “black day for Germany”. The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down — citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.",
            "Germany’s nuclear industry also stands ready to make a significant contribution in the market for services related to new build. ",
            "“The major challenge for the western nuclear industry is to build [nuclear plants] on time and on budget,” Wendler said. “Streamlining construction, tightening quality control and having a reliable and precise supply chain is what the German industry should develop.",
            "Wendler noted that Framatome and Westinghouse subsidiaries in Germany have been involved in new build projects. The Olkiluoto-3 construction project in Finland was in effect run from Germany with Areva NP and Siemens as the main contractors, he said.",
            "Anglo-German-Dutch uranium enricher Urenco operates a plant in Gronau, northwest Germany, which accounts for about 17% of Europe’s uranium enrichment capacity. This places Germany among the few countries that have centrifuge technology, a fundamental pillar of the nuclear industry supply chain.",
            "One of the strengths of German industry is that it has a tight-knit network of companies and research institutions that can bring knowhow to all sorts of engineering and manufacturing problems.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important {nuclear power} business within Germany,” Wendler said.",
            "“Many companies are seeking people to hire for a buildup in engineering and manufacturing capacities. This is due to a growing international market that has been energised by both the drive for political climate action and the geopolitical upheaval in consequence of the war in Ukraine.”",
            "In principle, said Wendler, there is a place for Germany in the development of new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors, although “this will depend on which SMRs we are talking about”. ",
            "Traditional light-water reactor designs based on the general type that have operated in Germany for decades could be supplied and supported by German supply chains. This means German industry could potentially work well for the Westinghouse AP300 SMR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 and the SMR being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK.",
            "“As for advanced reactors it is difficult to tell,” Wendler said. “I know that there are component manufacturers already developing parts or sub-systems for advanced reactors and the analytical and development capabilities available in Germany can be useful in this area.” ",
            "There are hopeful signals for the continuation of federal R&D funding for nuclear fusion. Earlier this month, Germany said it wants to build a “nuclear fusion ecosystem” made up of industry, startups and science so that a fusion power plant in the country becomes a reality as quickly as possible with a target of having a reactor in operation by 2040 – potentially making it among the first in Europe.",
            "“There is still room for improvement by broadening the range of government funded research topics,” Wendler said. “The German nuclear industry is prepared for this.”",
            "The cautiously bullish mood is helped by public opinion. Despite sometimes being against domestic large-scale nuclear, it always has been in favour of German owned or Germany-based companies developing and exporting nuclear technology, Wendler said.",
            "Germany closed its last nuclear power plants in April 2023​ as part of the Energiewende (energy transition) policy, which aims to shift the country towards renewable energy sources. Berlin had the second largest nuclear fleet in Europe.",
            "Neckarwestheim-2 was among the three nuclear plants to be finally shuttered on 15 April 2023."

            "The European Industrial Alliance on Small Modular Reactors is leading SMR deployment in Europe with the aim of establishing collaboration between industry, NGOs and various stakeholders and setting out an action plan early next year, Yves Desbazeille, director-general of the Brussels-based industry association nucleareurope, told an online event in London.",
            "Desbazeille told a New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI) webinar that the alliance, launched earlier this year, wants to create projects of common interest across Europe to benefit from state aid. It aims to formally start work in June 2024 under an action plan with 10 tasks, according to Desbazeille. ",
            "The idea is to consider different aspects, including a technical roadmap, and to develop an action plan by the first quarter of 2025, he added.",
            "“European SMRs have been gaining speed since the middle of 2021, enabling the organisation to be created,” Desbazeille said.",
            "Companies, organisations, research facilities, and single demonstration projects in any European country can join the alliance, while technical and project-based working groups will be created, according to Desbazeille. Such groups will include public engagement and fuel supply, he said. ",
            "The alliance will be open for membership applications from 9 April and in June will establish a governing body.",
            "“There are now 97 operating reactors in Europe with EUR 100 billion turnover,” Desbazeille noted.",
            "“SMRs in Europe are facing not one, but many barriers to successful deployment”, he said, adding that light-water reactors “clearly are a well-known technology, but the industrial concept of modular assembly is a challenge”.",
            "So, “accelerated deployment is one of the goals of the alliance, as well as financial availability”.",
            "A lot of EU funds cannot be used for nuclear, for instance the Just Transition Fund, which supports territories most affected by the transition towards climate neutrality and which could have acted like the US Project Phoenix fund, according to Desbazeille. Project Phoenix was launched in November 2022 to help coal reliant countries reduce the impact of climate change.",
            "“SMRs have an excellent case to replace coal, so we need to we need to build on the taxonomy and the Net Zero Industrial Act, where nuclear is fully included as a clean energy solution,” he said. ",
            "“We are at the starting point where something will change in the ways of thinking, so mobilisation is key to the industry”, added Desbazeille.",
            "“Many people think nuclear should be there, but it is now back to the industry to deliver,” said Desbazeille. “We can’t say we are going to do one reactor over the next 15 years, this is absolutely not doable,” he added.",
            "NNWI chairman Tim Yeo told the webinar SMRs have great potential, but while deployment could begin in the 2030s, mass deployment will not be seen until the 2040s.",
            "Chirayu Batra, chief technology officer of non-profit climate organisation Terra Praxis, said at the NNWI webinar that the company is working on the energy transition challenge, the biggest threat to humanity, under the ‘Repowering Coal’ initiative. The aim of the initiative is to provide standardised, pre-licensed designs supported by automated project development and design tools to enable customers to be ready to start construction on their SMR projects in the late 2020s.",
            "“We never saw such energy transition in society [to date]. We need many shifts in the system, so nuclear energy has to become a product”, Batra said.",
            "“Slow project growth and cumbersome permitting are challenges to the energy transition, but the concept of modular in SMRs is both of modularisation and standardisation”, Batra noted.",
            "“Standardisation of competence, as well as in design [is paramount], so we need to understand what can be assembled in SMRs in a timely manner. SMR designs need to be repeatable, with no variations, so adaptation to achieve this are needed”, he said.",
            "The goal is to replace 2 TWh of coal generation with SMRs by 2050 and Batra thinks this is possible, adding that transmission is a big issue, as well.",
            "Batra said the challenges facing SMR deployment include modelling the energy transition, questions over feasibility and public acceptance, which will get more difficult, and the fact that the new models should be based on suitable land. ",
            "He said Terra Praxis could help with model repurposing and SMR reactor construction. ",
            "“Fuel design is an issue for SMRs, as there could be potentially huge restrictions on fuel supply for some of the advanced reactors, so there is a need to discuss fuel qualification and supply for such units,” he added.",
            "Fredrik Vitaback, GE-Hitachi’s director of market development, Europe, said that “the transition to a low-carbon future comes with constraints, but the demand is now coming. As an industry we need to meet the climate change demands and security of supply challenges”, he told the webinar.",
            "“The [GE-Hitachi] BWRX-300 SMR model is the 10th generation, thus reducing the cost of capital needed to be adapted by the industry,” he said. “We are working in Europe with regulators to create an understanding of what the new technology brings.”",
            "“GE-Hitachi has got its first three customers, who have all approached their regulators for licensing. They also asked us to standardise the product, so we can work with investors to do that and create a gold standard,” said Vitaback. He said Estonia, Sweden and Poland all want to use this new [BWRX-300] technology.",
            "He said “a lot of cost and timeline issues are being thrown around, but we need to take decisions on clear licensing”. ",
            "“We are working in Europe to form understanding of all national regulators on our projects as they need to understand the benefits that this new technology brings,” Vitaback added.",
            "“We want ours to be the truly global first SMR product in the world, so regulators need to look at our technology and make sure it is licensable”, he said. ",

            "Heffer cited as evidence of this commitment the government’s investment of around €4.10bn (£3.50bn, $4.45bn) in the planned 3,260-MW Sizewell C nuclear plant in eastern England, the ongoing competition organized by DESNZ to select at least one small modular reactor (SMR) design for deployment in the UK by the early 2030s and investment through the government’s future nuclear enabling fund (FNEF) in enhancing fuel fabrication and uranium conversion capacity in the UK.",
            "Sizewell C is currently 51% owned by the UK government and 49% owned by French state nuclear power company EDF. The plant will comprise two 1.6-GW French EPR reactors and be built on a site adjacent to the existing 1,250-MW Sizewell B pressurised water reactor (PWR), the only PWR in the UK.  ",
            "Heffer said that “We expect a Final Investment Decision (FID) on Sizewell C by the end of this year,” adding that the country already had a “fuel manufacturing and production site in Springfields” outside Preston in northern England, owned by Westinghouse, where the government had already invested €15, 2 million (£13 million) from the FNEF to help develop uranium conversion capacity at the Springfields facility.",
            "Heffer added that the creation of the Great British Nuclear (GBN) government-owned entity to oversee the SMR competition and the government’s investment in Sizewell C demonstrate “a stronger role for the government in the UK nuclear sector. Energy security is also security for the UK.”",
            "He also said that “building a coherent system is the UK government approach [to the nuclear energy industry] rather than bits here and there.”",
            "He implied that currently the UK has got a system with bits here and there unlike the French one, but this is now changing. ",
            "Heffer also noted that high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) would be an “important addition to the market and that there are some [important] commercial or technological decisions” to soon be made on Haleu.",
            "Speaking during the same event on 23 February, Guy Esnouf, GBN’s director of communications, said that GBN has a “role on the planning, regulations and siting” of SMRs in the UK, through its oversight of the SMR competition. ",
            "Esnouf also said that GBN was “putting the contract together” to select at least one SMR design for deployment in the UK, and that GBN would also “set up development companies” to establish and construct SMRs in the UK, using the designs selected in the competition. ",
            "He added that the UK government and GBN hoped that an FID would be made on the first SMR to be deployed in the UK by 2029. ",
            "“The key timeline is FID by the end of 2029, that is really important, this is urgent,” Esnouf said. ",
            "GBN is working on SMR siting “during the first half of 2024, we will look to find and purchase sites or the reactor developers will develop their own sites. We are looking at sites and are focused on areas with nuclear experience,” Esnouf noted. ",
            "GBN would “look to place at least one or two SMRs at sites” that it selected for deployment, but GBN and the UK government really “want to build a fleet of SMRs” according to Esnouf. ",
            "“We need to take advantage of modularity to get quicker and more reliable development” of SMRs, Esnouf also said. ",
            "“We need to learn how to build a fleet and need to go beyond one or two sites,” he added. ",
            "In the second half of last year, the UK government has selected six SMR companies to continue to the next phase of a competition to design and build small modular reactors.",
            "These companies include EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. ",
            "The next bid expected, but not confirmed, as early as end of this month will secure the second round of the pre-selection process. ",
            "The DESNZ had said at the first selection round that the designs were “the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s”.",
            "The UK wants new nuclear to play role in its future net-zero energy transition as its ageing reactor fleet is preparing for retirement over the next decade."

            "A decision by the UK government on the future of nuclear development in the UK, and in particular the future of the sites at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd in north Wales, is urgently needed, a Welsh parliamentary committee has said.",
            "The Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee said in a report that a positive decision for Welsh nuclear sites will create the conditions for business confidence, directing government funding and focus, building resilient supply chains and upskilling the workforce. ",
            "It called on the UK government to set out when it will confirm the designated sites for future nuclear projects, the kinds of technology to be deployed, and the timeframes for implementation.",
            "The committee said: “New nuclear offers huge economic opportunities for the Welsh economy, but the lack of clarity is hindering efforts to build up the necessary skills base with scale and pace, and risks the loss of an existing skilled workforce that can be directed toward careers in nuclear energy.

            "Lack of cost competitiveness ‘will have implications’ exports",
            " Countries in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects will be likely to “double down their scrutiny” of small modular reactor offers following the cancellation of NuScale’s agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) for a Voygr SMR project in Idaho.",
            "Writing in his Neutron Bytes blog, nuclear energy analyst Dan Yurman said the lack of cost competitiveness of the NuScale Uamps project will have implications for US-based NuScale’s export opportunities for its Voygr technology in Romania, Poland, and Indonesia. ",
            "All three countries are price sensitive and are likely to closely assess offerings from NuScale and for every other developer of SMRs, for both light-water reactor and advanced designs, seeking export sales, Yurman wrote.",
            "“Other countries, like Estonia and the Philippines, which are in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects, will also likely be doubling down their scrutiny of SMR offers. ",
            "“The key competition in all of these countries will come from the price of natural gas used to generate electricity and time to deliver a gas plant v. building an SMR.”",
            "Yurman said the Uamps project was heavily subsidised by the US government in the form of $1.35bn (€1.24bn) in cash to make the first-of-a-kind new build affordable. ",
            "“However, until global inflationary pressures abate, no commercial customer in the Philippines, Poland, or anywhere else is likely to commit to multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures for multiple SMRs without the host domestic government providing financial and rate guarantees for the project,” the blog said.",
            "He said unless the US commits to major levels of export financing for SMRs, like the levels of commitment South Korea and Japan have shown over the years for full size reactors, all US SMR developers will be at a financial disadvantage to Russia and China when they eventually bring their SMRs to market. ",
            "“NuScale’s business decisions that led to the Uamps contract contain a number of missteps that can be avoided in future deals,” Yurman said.",
            "“NuScale should have sought as its first customer a utility with an operating nuclear reactor that would have a management team with the know-how to handle a new nuclear project.",
            "This “onsite strategy” would accrue significant cost savings with a switchyard and grid connection in place with a well-defined service area facing growing demand for power. Local and regional transportation networks, including rail, would have been available. Recruitment of skilled trades to build the plant and access to supply chains would be easier.",
            "Several other SMR developers are mindful of this issue. GE-Hitachi has plans to build multiple units of its BWRX-300 SMR at TVA’s Clinch River site in Tennessee and at OPG’s Darlington nuclear site in Canada. X-Energy announced its first advanced small modular reactor site near the Columbia nuclear power station in Washington state.",

            "An overall roadmap – which could come as soon 4 January – is needed to determine the next steps for new nuclear construction in the UK, including small modular reactors, an EDF executive said at a London industry conference. ",
            "The nuclear power industry is seeing growing demand for a strategic European approach, including in the UK, to enable SMR projects at different stages of development to get off the ground.  ",
            "Anne Falchi, head of strategy, nuclear new build, at EDF said: “I believe in a European SMR, as Europe has the ambition of having 150 GW of capacity by 2050, so effectively we will need to build 120 GW of nuclear capacity in Europe by 2050.” ",
            "“EDF knows well the UK’s capabilities, therefore we will need to identify new UK sites, so these activities can be localised”, she added.  ",
            "“Great British Nuclear [GBN] is looking in the right direction in relation to UK SMR deployment, and EDF has the experience of working with around 100 UK companies,” according to Falchi. “Namely, GBN has a very clear roadmap within Europe for its SMRs,” she said. ",
            "“We need a lot of large nuclear reactors. I do not believe in a UK or a French supply chain, but a European supply chain, so the UK needs to figure out what it is best at”, she added. ",
            "“We have EU partners to bring together the best capabilities, so we are trying not to localise the supply chain. ",
            "EDF’s Nuward SMR subsidiary is looking to develop the Nuward SMR, consisting of two 170-MW SMRs combined to form a 340-MW SMR plant using two pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The Nuward design has been developed using France's extensive experience in PWRs. ",
            "Falchi said “EDF is looking forward to see an overall roadmap for nuclear power in the UK, so that the country can reach serial production of the same reactor.” Such a roadmap should also include information on the potential location of new units in the country, she added. ",
            "Realising the promise of SMRs is a priority, including the delivery, cost and use of UK made nuclear fuel, said Rory O'Neil, director of government affairs, Westinghouse UK. He added that “there will be a global supply chain” for SMRs.  ",
            "“SMR procurement and [SMR] competition work is GBN’s most high profile workstream, although I also have AMR [advanced nuclear reactor] responsibilities”, said Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN’s interim chief executive officer at the annual Nuclear Industry Association conference in London earlier this month. ",
            "She said that maximising the ability to put nuclear power on the grid is key, as well as the need to work with a future system operator. A further priority is “the use of regulation and creation of a system for modularisation”, of new nuclear units, she added. “The nuclear roadmap, which is expected in January 2024, is built on specific points,” she said. ",
            "GBN is also planning to publish documents about siting principles and routes to markets, along with the nuclear roadmap. ",
            "EDF is competing with other developers to build SMRs in the UK, although the company has the advantage of being an established player and investor in the UK nuclear power market. ",
            "EDF has been selected by the UK government to participate in the next stage of the competition to develop one or more SMR designs in the UK, alongside GE-Hitachi, Holtec Britain, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse. ",
            "Renaud Crassous, Nuward’s president, has said in a press interview that the aim of the Nuward reactor design is to “fully integrate catalysts for success” of this SMR design, such as innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production, thus speeding the start of the construction of the first SMR. ",
            "The French nuclear safety regulator, as well as the Czech and Finnish regulators, are now collaborating for a pilot European early joint regulatory review of the Nuward design. EDF is cooperating with Italian companies on SMR development to achieve a standard for the European market.  ",

            "The UK government has confirmed plans to provide £170m (€197m, $218m) funding to support the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, southeast England, backed by fresh measures aimed at speeding up preparations for the flagship nuclear power project.",
            "The funding, which follows the official launch of the government body Great British Nuclear (GBN) last week, is being earmarked to further prepare the project’s construction site, secure essential components from its supply chain, and facilitate a larger workforce, according to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero.",
            "At the peak of construction, it is estimated that the project to build two Generation III+ EPR nuclear plants developed by France’s EDF could support around 10,000 jobs nationwide, with supply chain plans for 70% of the value of construction contracts set to go to UK businesses, it said.",
            "The government last year agreed to invest £700m to take a 50% stake in Sizewell C, which EDF has said it expects to cost around £20bn in total.",
            "The UK’s nuclear power capacity has been dwindling over the past several decades. In recent years the UK has generated about 15% of its power from its fleet of commercial nuclear power plants, but most are being retired this decade, with the last one – Sizewell B – due to close in 2035.",
            "Since 2000, the UK has seen permanent reactor shutdowns at Hinkley Point A, Bradwell, Calder Hall, Hunterston, Oldbury, Sizewell, Chapelcross, Dungeness and Wylfa.",

            "EDF said the project would both help to provide reliable, low-carbon power to the equivalent of six million homes over 60 years, while avoiding some nine million tonnes of CO2 emissions each year compared to using fossil fuel energy.",
            "By setting out clearer support for Britain's nuclear industry, the government said it hoped to attract further private investment into UK projects, alongside its planned introduction of the “tried and tested” regulated asset base (RAB) model for nuclear, and the inclusion of nuclear in the UK’s green taxonomy.",
            "Under the previous mechanism to support new nuclear projects – the contracts for difference (CfD) scheme – developers had to finance the entire construction cost of a nuclear project up front, and only began receiving revenue when the station starts generating electricity. ",
            "This model led to the cancellation of potential projects, such as Hitachi’s project at Wylfa Newydd in Wales and Toshiba’s at Moorside in Cumbria.",
            "Under the RAB scheme, private investors receive greater certainty through a lower and more reliable rate of return in the early stages of a project, lowering the cost of financing it, and ultimately helping reduce consumer electricity bills.",
            "Energy security secretary Grant Shapps said the UK is planning a massive revival of nuclear power.",
            "“Sizewell C represents the bridge between the ongoing construction of Hinkley Point C and our longer-term ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050,” Shapps said.",
            "“Our new nuclear fleet will provide clean, reliable, and abundant energy whilst driving down bills, boosting economic growth and ensure that the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like Putin.”",

            "“We have heard from a wide range of industry representatives that Wylfa is one of the best sites for nuclear development and it is difficult to see how the UK government can deliver its nuclear ambitions without taking forward a project at Wylfa,” the committee said.",
            "“We consider that Wylfa should be the location of the next gigawatt-scale nuclear generation plant after Sizewell C.”",
            "The committee said the UK government should continue to engage with Welsh government body Cwmni Egino on its ambition for Trawsfynydd to become the first site to host SMRs in the UK. ",
            "“We urge the government to include the Trawsfynydd site in the new Nuclear National Policy Statement as a potential site for SMRs,” the committee said.",
            "The committee said that successfully developing an SMR would present a huge opportunity for the UK, but noted the technology is still in development phase. ",
            "“Concrete commitment” by ministers on the future of nuclear energy, and in particular at Wylfa on Anglesey, is lacking despite positive policy signals, the committee said.",
            "New nuclear could be “a game-changer” for the North Wales economy, but warned that despite this, major obstacles remain before Wylfa could be home to a gigawatt-scale nuclear power station.",
            "The limitations of finance models and failure to reach a financial agreement with the UK government led to the Hitachi-led Wylfa Newydd project being suspended in 2019. The contracts for difference (CfD) financing model has been used to support nuclear energy projects including Hinkley Point C in southwest England.",
            "However, evidence to the committee suggested that a regulated asset base (RAB) model could reduce the overall cost of a large-scale nuclear project by £30bn (€34bn) compared with CfD. The committee heard that RAB is more attractive to investors, but the committee was concerned that the model puts some liability back to the taxpayer. It said careful monitoring of the RAB model for Sizewell C is therefore crucial.",
            "The issue of land ownership at Wylfa is a further barrier to progress. The committee said it is “unclear what the current state of plays is” at the site and called on the government to encourage Hitachi, which owns the Wylfa land, to sell it or join other developers to enable future development to proceed.",
            "The committee welcomed the UK government’s plans to include nuclear energy in the green taxonomy, saying the move will unlock new avenues of private investment for nuclear development and send the signals needed to the financial sector that nuclear energy is an attractive investment.",
            "The committee is exploring how likely it is that there will be a successful new nuclear development at Wylfa in light of the UK government’s shift towards nuclear energy. ",
            "Despite the rise of nuclear energy up the policy agenda to address both climate change and the UK’s energy security, the question of new nuclear at Wylfa has been ongoing for over a decade. ",
            "Wylfa and Trawsfynydd are both historic nuclear sites that both have two permanently shut-down nuclear reactors.",
            "Hitachi and project company Horizon Nuclear Power attempted to bring new gigawatt-scale reactors to Wylfa Newydd, on land next to the decommissioned Magnox reactors.",
            "However, Hitachi withdrew from the development in 2020 after failing to reach a financing agreement with the government. ",
            "In March 2023, the government published Powering Up Britain, a series of documents which set out how it will improve energy security and deliver on net zero. In the documents, the government recommitted itself to having 24 GW of nuclear energy – up from less than 6 GW today – by 2050 with a final investment decision on Sizewell C by the end of 2024 and two further nuclear projects to a final investment decision by the by the end of 2029.",

            "Around Europe, companies signed deals related to all stages of SMR development and deployment. Companies in Poland and the Czech Republic have announced SMR programmes. Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

Funding for the project was signed off by Boris Johnson at the start of September in one of his last acts as prime minister and confirmed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement. The twin EPR station is a joint endeavour with French state energy giant EDF and is expected to take a decade to build at the cost of between £20-£30bn. Large-scale reactors are under construction or consideration around the world. Test production has begun at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Flamanville-3 in France is close to completion, while fuel is being loaded at Vogtle in the US. Construction continued at Akkuyu, Turkey’s first nuclear station, with a second under consideration. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, around 30 countries are considering or embarking on the construction of new reactors. They include established nuclear nations such as the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, China and India, and newcomers such as Poland, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The International Energy Agency says a new wave of construction will be key to achieving net zero and ensuring energy security.  ",

A report by TerraPraxis said replacing coal-fired boilers at existing coal plants with carbon-free SMRs, also known as advanced heat sources, would transform coal-fired power plants from polluting liabilities facing an uncertain future, into a central component of a clean energy system transition – an important part of the massive and pressing infrastructure buildout needed to address climate change. The US Department of Energy said This “coal-to-nuclear” transition could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping the US reach its net-zero emissions goals by 2050. TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, plans to deploy its Natrium reactor technology at a coal site in the US state of Wyoming.

            "Grossi and US energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, the conference president, delivered opening remarks at the three-day event in Washington together with William Magwood, director-general of the Nuclear Energy Agency. ",
            "Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, and investor and philanthropist Bill Gates spoke via video at the conference, attended by more than 750 participants including ministers, policymakers and experts from around the world.",
            "Gates told the conference: “We need advanced reactors as well as contribution from the installed base of reactors we have today. Using this clean energy source is important to a clean energy future.”",
            "TerraPower, a reactor technology company founded by Gates, is developing its Natrium reactor technology in partnership with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy. In 2021, TerraPower announced its intention to build the first Natrium reactor\r\nat a retiring coal facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming.",
            "The opening speakers pointed to growing global interest in using nuclear power to help achieve net zero emissions while ensuring energy security and contributing to sustainable development. They stressed the continuous need for high standards of nuclear safety, security and safeguards.",
            "Grossi said he saw “great hopes” the world “can realise this imperative of the time: to bring the solutions in terms of prosperity, in terms of growth, in terms of caring for the common house, our planet, through the beneficial uses of nuclear energy”.",
            "In her opening remarks, Granholm said: “We see enormous potential in nuclear power to advance our climate goals, to enhance our energy security, to widen affordable energy access, to create millions of high quality, good paying jobs.”",
            "The second largest low-carbon source of electricity after hydro power, nuclear energy provides around 10% of the world’s electricity. By producing a steady supply of low carbon electricity, as well as industrial heat and hydrogen, nuclear power can help decarbonise sectors such as industry. ",
            "According to the NEA, nuclear power needs to triple in generating capacity by 2050 to meet climate goals, Magwood said. But in addition to providing low carbon power, “our highest responsibility is to make sure that our people, our populations, our societies have access to reliable energy – that they have secure energy”, he added.",
            "The IEA sees a future “dominated by electricity, and clean, secure electricity is a must,” Birol said. “Here, together with renewables, which will get the lion’s share of the growth in electricity generation, nuclear has an important role to play.”",

            "Estonia's Fermi Energia has selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) for potential deployment in the Baltic country by the early 2030s. Two other SMR designs had been under consideration.",
            "A rendering of a BWRX-300 plant (Image: GEH)",
            "In September 2022, Fermi Energia said it would accept tenders from three SMR developers: GE Hitachi, NuScale and Rolls-Royce. Bids with the comprehensive technical documentation needed to estimate the construction cost were expected by December. The company said in the selection of technology, the criteria were technological maturity, the establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "Fermi Energia has now announced the selection of GEH as the winning bidder, and said it will now sign a project development and preliminary works contract.",
            "GEH's BWRX-300 design is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor. It is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission pre-licensing Vendor Design Review and a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission pre-application design review.",
            "\"As the initial construction will start in Canada, Fermi Energia saw the reactor as the most suitable for construction in Estonia out of the three offers received,\" it said. \"Based on the design and construction experience of the Darlington nuclear power plant near Toronto, Ontario, the planning, design and construction of the Estonian nuclear power plant can also be gradually started.\"",
            "\"The BWRX-300 is in principle a boiling water reactor, which is used and well known by many European countries, including Finland and Sweden,\" noted Fermi Energia CEO Kalev Kallemets. \"However, the specific reactor model is much smaller than the ones used in the nuclear plants of our northern neighbours, which allows greater safety, lower cost, and shorter build time. At the same time, it is possible to rely on the experience of neighbours and offer the consumer clean electricity at an affordable and stable price.\"",
            "GEH and Fermi Energia have worked together since 2019 when an agreement was reached to collaborate on potential deployment applications for the BWRX-300. The collaboration advanced in 2021 when the two parties entered into a teaming agreement to work together in key areas that included licensing support and supply chain development.",
            "\"We are honoured that our small modular reactor technology has been selected by Fermi Energia to help Estonia fulfill its energy security and climate goals,\" said GEH President and CEO Jay Wileman. \"By leveraging a unique combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components and a design based on an already licensed reactor, the BWRX-300 offers cost-competitive zero-emission generation in a meaningful timeframe.\"",
            "GEH noted the technology selection by Fermi Energia is the latest development involving the BWRX-300. Last month, it was announced that GEH, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), SNC-Lavalin and Aecon have signed a contract for the deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at OPG's Darlington site. In August last year, Tennessee Valley Authority began planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site in Tennessee. Canada's SaskPower announced in June 2022 that it selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s.",
            "In Poland, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners started the pre-licensing process by submitting an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE plans to deploy a fleet of BWRX-300s with the potential for deployment of the first of those units by the end of this decade.",
            "To support the global deployment of the BWRX-300, GEH has a memorandum of understanding or other agreement in place with companies in Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, the UK, the USA and Sweden, among others. GEH has also begun the design certification process for the BWRX-300 in the UK.",
            "\"The choice of BWRX-300 by Polish, Swedish and other European companies gives assurance that the competence and supply chain of the selected technology will be sufficient in Europe,\" Kallemets said.",
            "Fermi Energia noted that, in order to construct a nuclear power plant in Estonia, a decision is needed from the parliament - the Riigikogu - to approve the use of nuclear energy in the country. Also, a special national plan to find a suitable location for the plant must be undertaken, as well as the development of nuclear energy legislation.",
            "\"We have analysed all the work ahead and consider it realistic to produce reliable, clean and affordable nuclear energy in Estonia by Christmas 2031, which should also be in the interest of society and the country's climate goals,\" Kallemets said. \"Understandably, this goal requires a serious effort from both the state and Fermi Energia.\"",
            "Fermi Energia was founded by Estonian energy and nuclear energy professionals to develop deployment of SMRs in Estonia. In July 2019, the company launched a feasibility study on the suitability of SMRs for Estonia's electricity supply and climate goals beyond 2030, following a financing round from investors and shareholders. It selected four SMR designs to be included in the feasibility study: Moltex Energy SSR-W300, Terrestrial Energy IMSR-400, GE Hitachi BWRX-300 and NuScale SMR.",

            "Nuclear energy needs to be part of the mix",
            "\"Carbon reduction is a truly global challenge. I’m an all-of-the-above kind of person so I completely agree that we ought to be maximising the use of renewable energy, but even if we do, most people agree now that you can’t get all the way to net zero without nuclear being a part of the mix. That said, nuclear still has to earn its seat at the table and to do that it's got to be cost-competitive. In addition you have to have certainty of outcome around that in both cost and time. The regulatory approval process is really, really key to that timing and to that cost. So we need to make sure that we're really focused on getting things as efficient and cost effective as we can. We've got to be reliable coming out of the gate, with high capacity factors and low outage durations.\"",
            "\"Our headquarters is in the US, but we consider ourselves a  global business. And to be able to do that, we have to integrate as we think through the life-cycle of this technology. What we really need globally is that bold leadership of governments to set energy policy so that it's well understood and predictable, and then to figure out how to develop roadmaps that recognise nuclear power's role in that energy transition. Canada has done a great job of that. The UK has said it wants 24 gigawatts of nuclear. So those type of goals and visions really help.\"",
            "Why the need for regulatory harmonisation?",
            "\"Governments really need to provide the regulators with a suitable mandate of how to participate and fulfil their mission of safety - which I absolutely want them to do - and to make sure they get them the resources, and break down any barriers that might be out there, so that they can efficiently license any and all of these designs. If nuclear is going to get that seat at the table and be able to really deliver, it's urgently needed to maximise and optimise the collaboration and cooperation between the regulators across a lot of different countries and to streamline collaborative reviews to get nuclear deployed as soon as possible. There is a great example of these fundamental requirements from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but they can be interpreted differently by the national regulators, and that leads to different design changes to your base design. And that is documented very well in the document",
            "Different Interpretations of Regulatory Requirements (DIRR).",
            "What impact does a lack of harmonisation have?",
            "\"The differences in a regulatory regime, or in interpretations of a common set of regulations, can result in regulatory uncertainty … and that is in a risk register of what you have to consider to address in your project cost and timeline for deployment. So here at GE Hitachi we are creating a standard design with our small modular reactor, the BWRX-300 will adhere to the IAEA standards that can be adapted to different regulatory regimes around the individual countries. We're looking at the ability for that set of IAEA standards to provide the roadmap that conforms with all of the different regulators around the globe. And what we want to do is to make sure that the regulators, all, when they're reading the same thing, all agree it means the same thing, rather than having different interpretations. Those differences in design review and licensing can lead to an average cost to a reactor vendor of perhaps USD250 million. So it’s something that is substantial. And that is to undertake generic licensing activities such as design certification in the US or the Generic Design Assessment (GDA) process in the UK. So when we want to build our long-term order book and be able to ramp up a global supply chain, having harmonised regulations is really a critical component.\"",
            "What is being done to promote the issue of harmonisation?",
            "\"I'm excited about the work that",
            "(World Nuclear Association’s Cooperation in Reactor Design Evaluation and Licensing working group) is doing.",
            "has 15 years of experience in this area and absolutely a wealth of knowledge … I really see",
            "as a glue between the industry and the regulators and helping to identify those gaps within all the international initiatives and in developing best practice on how to move on harmonisation and move it to the next step. I like to see",
            "working with the IAEA's nuclear harmonisation and standardisation initiative NHSI.\"",
            "\"All small modular reactors are really based on the concept of repetition, of modularisation. So doing the same thing well over and over again. This means that any design changes that are imposed by different interpretations of the regulatory requirement may very well impact the design or size or features of some of those modules, and when you think about that, it makes getting to the 'Nth of a kind' deployment pretty tough. So one of the examples from the DIRR report I mentioned earlier was a requirement from the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation to add HEPA (high efficiency particulate absorbing) filters to the reactor building on the design of our ABWR. That’s a classic example where something that really seemed like a good idea from a safety perspective, but doesn't demonstrate to have any overall increase in the safety of the plant, takes a lot of the rector vendor and the regulatory time and adds cost and duration to that budget.\"",
            "Are there emerging signs of harmonisation?",
            "\"Yes, we're watching it live right now. For us at GE Hitachi, we're making great progress in building and licensing the first commercial SMR project in North America and taking that to deploy globally. So I applaud the cooperation between the CNSC (in Canada) and the US NRC in reviewing the BWRX-300. There's a lot of design reviews that will be required to go through these processes and for those two regulators to cooperate is a great way to overcome the challenge. I also saw in the news recently we now have collaboration between CNSC and the ONR (in the UK) as well, so that's another side of the triangle that will really help to be able to have a common understanding and common design reviews where they're collaborating, while still maintaining the sovereignty that's required for each of the countries. As an industry, not just GE HItachi, but all vendors really need that collaboration between the regulators and we've seen the further step up from the IAEA with the NHSI initiative. So I'm excited, I see things moving and we have just got to go faster and faster.\"",
            "Is the goal to get to a place where, like an aircraft, the approval covers multiple countries?",
            "\"That would be Nirvana, but I'll take good harmonisation as step one toward that. I think that is a necessary precursor, to get to there, if we ever do. But again, it's all about regulatory path, certainty and understanding what those requirements are, and having them shown to be the same, so that you've reduced your cost and schedule in that process.\"",
            "\"I'm not going to be able to just copy and paste and replace ‘CNSC’ with ‘NRC’. They'll clearly have some different work, and that's OK. It's really when you get to the heart of how a regulation is interpreted and then the follow on …  that is what drives the differences. So we’d love to get there, but this harmonisation effort is a good step forward.”",
            "What should we look out for in the year ahead?",
            "“2023 is going to be a great and busy year. For the BWRX-300 in Canada we expect to complete our vendor design review process and then continue through the licensing and engineering process with our customer OPG. That's for the BWRX-300 at the Darlington site, and that’s where we anticipate construction could be completed as soon as 2028. So great to see a launch of this technology. In the US, we're working with our customer TVA on the licensing of the first commercial SMR in the United States, and we're working with them to complete the construction permit application and move forward. So again, really excited for North America and a lot of synergies between those projects as well, not just on the project, but of course the NRC and CNSC collaboration. In the UK we've submitted the generic design assessment application for the BWRX-300 and we're starting to work on the GDA, so a lot of activities and again a lot of synergies between the regulators there. In Poland, Orlen Synthos Green Energy has started the pre-licensing process for the BWRX-300 there - they plan on deploying a fleet of the 300s with the first unit by the end of this decade. So a lot of activity again, one more regulator in the PAA there, that is a great opportunity to leverage a lot of the IAEA NHSI and the",
            "work, and we're happy to be just right in the middle of that. And we also have MoU's outstanding with Czech Republic and Sweden and others. I'm really excited about what's going to happen and the acceleration we're going to get in this project in 2023.\"",
            "How will the nuclear energy sector look by 2060?",
            "\"Our target is for net zero by 2050. If we have that sense of urgency and we continue to value the need for more and more electricity, but carbon-free electricity, so that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren, can have a great planet here, we've got a lot of work to do. So I would love to see 2060 as a continuation of what we have achieved in 2050 - just continuing to bring forward these small modular reactors, Gen 4 reactors and, who knows, fusion might even be possible by then. We will see, but there's a lot of work to do to go through the next couple of decades. And that'' what I'm thinking about in leading GE Hitachi. You know the work we're doing, yes it's to serve our customers today operating very reliably the zero emission 24/7 energy secure installed base today. But really, the play is for the future, to help us achieve everything that we're planning on.\"",

Things were looking not as good for nuclear, but they've really picked up now and and I could probably name you 20 countries that in the past 12 months have done a complete U-turn on nuclear and are now looking at expanding their fleets or bringing on reactors or SMRs perhaps.

We lost some of our competitors over it, who were producing into a spot market that fell as low as USD17 per pound in 2017. We said we're only going to produce into the contracts we have and so that meant, for us, taking some really tough medicine. Back in 2016, we shut down our Rabbit Lake mine. We shut down Wyoming, Nebraska and then in 2017 we shut down the world’s largest high-grade mine and mill McArthur River/Key Lake because the world didn't need the uranium and no one else seemed to be stepping up, so we did that. We left over 100 million pounds in the ground at USD17 ... We maintained our supply discipline and today we have a better market. It's better, good enough that we can bring our big McArthur River/Key Lake production centre back into production at reduced levels that will match our sales, and so we'll continue with that as our sales grow, we'll bring on more production, but we will remain very, very disciplined from a production and a marketing point of view ... You'll see some production out of McArthur and Key Lake later this quarter. In the fourth quarter.”",
            "On the Cameco-Westinghouse deal",
            "\"We think the timing is really good. As I said, we've seen some real strong tailwinds coming for nuclear. We could see nuclear coming back as a tool in the toolkit for energy security around the world and so first we looked after our own operations. We made sure we were ready to go and we're restarting, as I say, McArthur River/Key Lake. Cigar Lake’s running well. Our Kazakh operations are running well. Our fuel services conversion in Ontario is really doing well, so we started looking for other things in our area. We're not straying outside of nuclear. Westinghouse was out there and we started looking at it with Brookfield, who was the owner and just a different entity of Brookfield - their Clean Energy Transition Fund - wanted to get involved and we said, 'well, that's brilliant'. Seeing nuclear as clean energy, them buying in, staying in, and then us coming along as a strategic partner and it just made perfect sense. So it took us about six months of due diligence and negotiations. And we think we found the right timing, the right partner and the right project. So we're super excited about the future of Westinghouse.”",
            "The news that Westinghouse was a successful bidder in Poland for its nuclear programme \"is just icing on the cake for us\".",
            "So what part of the Westinghouse deal is most exciting for Cameco?",
            "\"I'd say all of it is pretty exciting for us. Obviously the fuel business - our fuel businesses are very complementary. We provide fuel, we have the uranium conversion and then we actually provide the fuel for the CANDU reactor fleet here in Canada - Bruce Power, OPG, NB Power. Westinghouse takes over where we don't go. They’re in the light water reactor world and provide fuel there and then of course all the servicing and engineering and outages that they can work on. So that's all exciting stuff, that's their core business really and it's a very durable business. There is some excitement too with some of these new products that they're offering. Obviously the AP1000s that they're out selling. I think for Westinghouse, the e-Vinci,  a smaller unit ... I know here in Saskatchewan the government has been talking about perhaps buying and building one of the e-Vincis ... as Cameco we're looking at fuel for SMRs and whether we can play in that field, the HALEU field. We have the GLE global laser enrichment play in the US that we're moving along and moving along faster than we have because of the need for enrichment and so just a lot of areas for us to focus on now. We think there's a lot of room for growth in the nuclear business across the board, and Cameco wants to be there for that.\"",
            "What has been the impact of the war in Ukraine?",
            "\"Let me start with the impact on our countries, and here in Saskatchewan where our head office is located, I think 15 or 20% of our population here are of Ukrainian heritage, and so it's a really sad state of affairs. And our hearts go out to the people in Ukraine, including our customers at Energoatom. Petro Kotin, President and CEO of Energoatom, is a good friend of mine. We had dinner with him just before the end of last year at a big conference in Paris and then, this happened, so our hearts go out on that side first of all. What has it done for the nuclear industry? It has certainly caused a bit of a bifurcation now in the nuclear industry. Meaning there's those countries and companies that will continue to work with Russia - there are some - but there are a lot that won't anymore, and I think of all the Eastern European countries that have VVER technology in their countries and have relied heavily on the Russians for fuel and servicing and engineering and the things we talked about who are now looking for alternatives, and so we think Westinghouse will have a good opportunity in that market to pick up some business. And then Cameco - I was over there in the spring in the Czech Republic and meeting with some of those countries and so we think some of those will start looking West for alternative fuel supply and we'll be there to provide that, so it's really had a huge impact on the global nuclear industry and on Cameco’s business.\"",
            "What about the global situation for Cameco?",
            "\"We have customers in China and India - two countries that continue to grow, with China on a very fast path of growth and India, the same thing. And you see things changing - South Korea, a complete change - they were looking at phasing out some of their nuclear, now they've included it in their green taxonomy and plan to increase their nuclear presence. I mean, you can go to the UK, you can go to France and you can go to Japan and you can just see the momentum that nuclear is getting both from a clean energy perspective but from an energy security perspective as well. So we think there's great room for growth. I think the IEA came out last week and said if we have about 400 gigawatts today of nuclear, we need to double that. Double that in the next 20-25 years - and so for us that's not a long period of time. We need to get moving and get moving now and we're seeing it with Poland making their announcement, in the US - we're spending lots of time in the US where the Biden administration is very, very positive on nuclear with the Inflation Reduction Act, which has lots of support for nuclear. Here in Canada, our own government, the Ontario government and OPG building the first SMR are well on their way in Canada, the GE Hitachi model and so lots of excitement. Lots of things to do and lots of opportunities around the world.\"",
            "On technological developments in the nuclear energy sector",
            "\"Especially on the small modular reactor front I would say I think that the Canadian regulator has in front of them probably 11 or 12 different models of SMR right now, all competing to be the first out of the gate to get permitted, licenced and start construction and find a home and we need that because those first-of-a-kinds won't be easy. They never are. We've seen it in the larger reactor world and now in the SMR world we need to start building them - the Nth one will be super economic and then probably faster to build. The first one will be tough, and then we need to get the fuel ready for those. And you know, there's your question on Russia and Ukraine. I think we were all relying on many models, relying on the Russians for the HALEU fuel for the first SMRs. Now that door has been slammed shut. And so we're all looking around, scrambling maybe, but looking around for alternative ways we can get HALEU to fire up those first SMRs. So that's going on, but lots of great things going on even with the large fleet - such as accident tolerant fuel and passive safety systems. There's lots going on in nuclear and it's very exciting and very positive.\"",
            "How does the current positive outlook compare with previous optimistic eras?",
            "\"We've seen ebbs and flows before. I remember the period from about 2000 to March 2011. I mean there were too many new reactors to keep track of them. So many uranium companies. I think there were 400 uranium companies around. We got into a real exuberant period of time, probably over-the-top exuberance on nuclear. Everybody was building all the time and then we had Fukushima, so we need to be careful about that because after that we went into a 10 year period that wasn't so positive. But I think we're back again. The world is taking another look at nuclear and saying 'yes we can do it, we can do it safely and and cover for these large energy needs'. I mean, if we're turning to electricity for electric cars and electric everything, we're going to need massive amounts of electricity. And we're good at nuclear, we're very good. We've got a great track record over probably 60 years now and new technologies coming out. And so I'm very optimistic about this period. We need to do it right. We need to get financing for new build. We need to build them as much on time and on budget as we can. We've suffered from that blight a bit in the past, but if we do it right and we can do it right because we've done it in the past, the first one is difficult, but then after that you saw it in Sweden in the 1970s, you saw it in France, you saw it in the US, Canada. We can do it and so now is our opportunity, so we should take advantage of that.\"",
            "Does Brookfields Renewables’ involvement in Westinghouse deal show taxonomy’s importance?",
            "\"I think countries around the world are really recognising the clean energy benefits of nuclear power now and really grabbing on to it - I think there's 70 countries who have now made a net-zero commitment and you know, I think 80% of the energy in the world is fossil fuel fired so we need the path to get there. So you can't throw anything out of the toolbox and I think a lot of countries, as I mentioned earlier, are looking around and saying, what do we have - wind, yes, solar yes. Intermittent and right now they are five or six or maybe 10% of the world production of electricity. We need massive amounts more, and they're looking at nuclear again and saying ‘yeah, we need to keep that as an option’. And so it's very positive for countries looking to hit their net-zero commitments. We're seeing it. We'll see it at COP27 meetings where nuclear is at the table. I can tell you a few COPS ago, we weren't at the table and now we're front and centre at the table of countries looking to build nuclear. So I think nuclear is going to play a huge role in the climate change race to net-zero and decarbonisation electrification. And we as an industry must be ready.\"",
            "On new forms of investors in the nuclear industry",
            "\"We saw it here in Canada last week where the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which has traditionally not gone anywhere near nuclear, committed just under a CAD1 billion to the first SMR - OPG’s SMR. That's a big move. Our Minister of Natural Resources came out with very strong statements last week at the IAEA ministerial, as did many other countries on nuclear. You're seeing taxonomies change that are including nuclear in the clean energy discussion ... it's a complete change of lexicon, a change of thinking, and very positive for industry and now, as I say, we need to deliver.\"",
            "So what are the big challenges to fulfilling the potential?",
            "\"I think we have the technologies, now we've got to start building again. I think on the SMR front we need to get some of those built and up and running so that we can build the Nth one, not the first one. The order books are out there now. I think everyone’s going to be watching very closely in Canada as OPG and GE Hitachi build that first unit. The ground is broken so they're off to the races on that one. And I know in the US there's numerous other ones, we need to get those going. On the big units that are being built - the Chinese are very good at it, the Russians are very good and have a big order book. We in the West now need to show that we're back in the game and that we can take our share of the market. I think the announcement with Poland and Westinghouse was a huge announcement, it's going to be a big project. And I think there are more to come. And so we need to show the world that we can deliver our projects on time, on budget, that nuclear is going to be a critical part of the clean energy infrastructure going forward, and we on the fuel side have to be there to back it up with the fuel to run these things. And that’s not for a year or five years or even 10 years - for 50 years. When you're building a reactor today, you're worried about uranium in 2060 and 2080 and so that's what we're thinking about now. It's not just the next few years, it's decades.”",

            "The key quotes from the Great British Nuclear (GBN) chairman's",
            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

            "The professional services consultancy has further increased its 2024 tender price inflation forecast for real estate to 3.2%, up from the 2.7% it previously predicted in December. Infrastructure stays the same at 4.5% but this is lower than 2023’s 5.5% and 10% in 2022.",
            "Turner & Townsend forecasts have been made in the context of the construction industry’s current mixed outlook. In 2023, construction saw growth of 2% which was far ahead of the 0.1% of other sectors. Demand for new work in the sector has since then weakened considerably, with the end of 2023 seeing the lowest rate of new orders since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008.",
            "Quarter on quarter data shows new orders for construction projects fell by 13.1% in Q4 2023 compared to Q3. In value terms, new orders fell to £9bn, the lowest level since Q2 2020 when it reached £6bn during Covid-19 lockdown restrictions.",
            "On construction contract awards, the paper says: “With new orders at their weakest since the global financial crisis this is expected to result in lower demand for materials and labour.",
            "“We have already seen that inflationary pressures from these two input sources starting to ease and as capacity loosens further deflationary pressures can be expected.”",
            "This is in complete contrast to recent statistics which revealed the signing of the £1.3bn tunnels and approaches deal for the Lower Thames Crossing took infrastructure contract awards to their highest level in four years last month.",
            "The UKMI report states: \"Meanwhile, nuclear power, both traditional and small modular reactors, received welcome attention in the Spring Budget, bringing confidence that support for the sector will remain strong.\"",
            "This attention included the government's purchase of two nuclear sites from Hitachi. ",
            "The report points to a more positive outlook over the forecast horizon for infrastructure. It uses several projects in the infrastructure pipeline that are effecting this. Namely, the Asset Management Period 8 (AMP8) in 2025 affecting all English and Welsh water companies. Proposals would see £96bn investment in the period, an 88 percent increase from AMP7, to fund new reservoirs, upgrade pipes and clean waterways.",
            "The report further highlights continued headwinds, with the UK in technical recession and facing the prospect of political uncertainty as the country prepares for a general election later in the year.",

            "“To ensure growth while prices remain high and the future uncertain, effective cost and project management will be crucial.",
            "“The greatest exposure to political uncertainty will run through the supply chain – so clients need to better understand their suppliers to identify and share risk.  New contracting strategies, more robust procurement, and careful apportioning of risk through project teams will be essential.”"

The plans also include the provision to build a new power station as big as Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C.",
            "The government believes its Civil Nuclear Roadmap will provide the industry with certainty of the future direction of the nuclear programme, building on its commitment to Sizewell C and its competition to develop small modular reactor (SMR) technology. It also builds on the establishment of the new body Great British Nuclear (GBN) last summer.",
            "The plans include the next steps for exploring a GW-scale power plant as big as Sizewell in Suffolk or Hinkley in Somerset and also include a government ambition to secure 3-7GW worth of investment decisions every five years from 2030 to 2044 on new nuclear projects.",
            "Wylfa, on the island of Anglesea in Wales, has long been earmarked as the location for the next large-scale plant in the UK, though no official move has been made to buy the land from current owners Hitachi. Last November, the Nuclear Energy All Party Parliamentary Group urged the government to move ahead with the plan.",
            "Also included in the Civil Nuclear Roadmap are plans to streamline the development of new power stations and introduce “smarter” regulation. This will aim to speed up the overall process and delivery of nuclear power in the UK. It includes allowing regulators to assess projects while designs are finalised, and better join-up with overseas regulators assessing the same technology.",
            "The roadmap further includes the publication of two consultations, one on a new approach to siting future nuclear power stations and another on supporting the sector and encouraging private investment to roll out advanced nuclear projects.",
            "Analysis by the Nuclear Skills Strategy Group suggests that to reach up to 24GW, the civil and defence nuclear workforce will need to double over the next 20 years – supporting around 80,000 additional skilled jobs across the UK.",
            "The government reports that the Nuclear Skills Taskforce will shortly set out plans to meet the demand of the industry. This plan is likely to include increasing the numbers of graduates and apprentices and attracting mid-careerists with relevant skills and expertise.",
            "As part of the Civil Nuclear Roadmap, the UK becomes the first country in Europe to launch a high-tech nuclear fuel programme, named HALEU, with up to £300M investment to be provided for the production of fuel to power nuclear reactors.",
            "The government believes this investment will allow the UK to lead the way from its North West production hub to provide the world with uranium fuel, with the first plant aiming to be operational early in the next decade. This builds on the ambition to return uranium conversion to the Springfields nuclear fuel site.",

These steps will ensure that the UK achieves its goal of 24GW of nuclear power and “breathe new life into Britain’s industrial heartlands” according to the report.",
            "The APPG’s five over-arching recommendations for GBN are in bold and further details are outlined below.",

            "The APPG says that there need to be measures to ensure that the Planning Inspectorate’s regulation is “proportionate to the urgent need for more clean energy to fight climate change”.",
            "It says that the Planning Inspectorate “must be instructed explicitly to make more sensible and proportionate decisions from the start”. The APPG cites the Planning Inspectorate’s recommendations against developing Wylfa Newydd and Sizewell C on “minor environmental grounds” while simultaneously acknowledging their value to the country’s clean power needs as evidence that it does not act sensibly.",
            "It further recommends that regulatory bodies involved in the planning, permitting, licencing and consenting of new nuclear projects be properly resourced to enable timely and proportionate decisions.",
            "National Policy Statements related to nuclear power developments must be updated and adopted rapidly, the APPG adds.",
            "The APPG says that dozens of small modular reactors (SMRs) will be needed to support decarbonisation so these steps must be taken to ensure rapid deployment is possible.",
            "Publish a Nuclear Roadmap this year that outlines a full programme of projects to 2050 to enable national nuclear workforce planning and maximum UK content in future nuclear projects",
            "The government recently promised that, by the end of 2023, it will release a “practical” road map for achieving 24GW of nuclear energy.",
            "The APPG says that this road map must be “detailed” as “we can only attract investment, attract new people and build new capabilities in nuclear if we have new projects”.",
            "Commenting on current plans, the report says that the government’s pledge to reach final investment decision (FID) for Sizewell C in this Parliament and for two other as-yet-unknown projects to reach FID in the next Parliament (2024-2029) would, at best, “leave us 21 years, 12GW and billions of pounds short of our ambition”.",
            "Therefore the road map must support lifetime extensions for the existing nuclear fleet; set out the sites on which new stations can be built and how much capacity they will each have; set targets for how many projects will reach FID in each Parliament to 2050; establish the preferred funding model for these projects; and publish a standard structure for funding large scale nuclear projects.",
            "Commit the funding to GBN necessary to build its developer capabilities and to invest directly in at least the first two small modular reactor (SMR) projects and next large-scale project",
            "The APPG believes that there needs to be more clarity over GBN’s remit. It would like to know if GBN will own nuclear sites, whether it will be responsible for planning or other consents, whether it will hold nuclear site licences and if it will operate the reactors once complete.",
            "It also asserts that the government should commit to GBN having resources to take equity shares in SMR and GW scale projects as required. Further, the regulated asset base (RAB) model combined with direct public sector equity investment should be established as the government’s preferred funding model for future projects.",
            "Select a partner for the next large-scale nuclear project beyond Sizewell C in this Parliament",
            "The APPG points out that many Western large-scale reactor designs are now running and their supply chains active. It believes “the UK should seize this opportunity to start a negotiated process to determine which reactor technology is best placed to deliver a further large-scale project at Wylfa, while maximising British supply chain expertise”.",
            "It says that Wylfa is the best site in Europe for a large-scale nuclear plant and “thus ideal for realising the fleet effect of multi-unit replication”.",
            "It believes the government should therefore purchase the Wylfa land and IP of Horizontal Nuclear Power from Hitachi. It should then give the development access to the RAB funding model and put in a government “cornerstone” equity stake to increase investor confidence. It should also support GBN in securing planning consent and expedite site licencing.",
            "It believes that a partner to bring the project to fruition must be chosen by the end of this Parliament.",
            "Award funding and assign sites to SMR Technology Partners by March 2024",

            "The next stage will be launched \"shortly\" and at this point the chosen companies will be able to submit their bids for government contracts. Great British Nuclear aims to announce which of them will get government support in spring 2024, with the contracts officially awarded in the summer.",
            "\"This timetable aims to make this competition the fastest of its kind in the world,\" Great British Nuclear states.",
            "Great British Nuclear was only launched this summer with the SMR competition as its primary goal, initially. The announcement of the shortlist is seen as a major milestone in its mission to rapidly upscale generation of atomic energy.",
            "Energy security secretary Claire Coutinho said: \"Small modular reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power; deliver cheaper, cleaner and more secure energy for British families and businesses; create well-paid, high-skilled jobs; and grow the economy.",
            "\"This competition has attracted designs from around the world and puts the UK at the front of the global race to develop this exciting, cutting-edge technology and cement our position as a world leader in nuclear innovation.\"",
            "Great British Nuclear chief executive Gwen Parry-Jones said the announcement of the shortlist was \"a key step forward\" towards boosting nuclear power generation in the UK.",
            "\"These companies will now be able to prepare for the next stages of the competition, aiming for a final contract agreement in the summer, potentially benefiting from significant support from the public purse,\" she added.",
            "The government is set to consult later in the year on how best to ensure other nuclear technologies can potentially get underway in the UK – and this could include some of the technologies that were not selected through this process.",
            "\"This is a hugely exciting day for the nuclear industry, with six companies taking the first step towards delivering sustainable power for Britain. For companies who were not successful in this initial process, the next opportunity could be the government’s consultation on alternative routes to market for nuclear technologies, which is due to be launched soon.\"",
            "The government hopes to make a final investment decision on SMRs this decade and have them up and running by the mid-2030s.",
            "Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said: “Today’s announcement helps keep Britian in the global race on innovative nuclear technologies. Small Modular Reactors are a vital part of the UK’s plan to produce enough clean, reliable and secure electricity to meet future demand, which is set to quadruple by 2050.",
            "“It is good to see such a wide range of companies shortlisted, and we hope that the work carried out over the next few months is both thorough and swift, so that we don’t fall behind other countries in delivering a programme of new nuclear stations. We are also looking forward to seeing what support there is for the companies who were not successful in the process.",
            "“There needs to be a huge ramp up of new nuclear stations, both SMRs and large-scale stations, and we must keep up this momentum.”"

            "A group of cross-party Welsh MPs are calling for the government to make “more progress in finding a buyer” for the Wylfa land on Anglesey where a potential new nuclear power station could be built.",
            "The Welsh Affairs Committee published its latest Nuclear energy in Wales last week, based on evidence gathered in May, and stated that, based on information heard by a wide range of experts, Wylfa is one of the best sites for nuclear development in the UK and the country will struggle to reach its nuclear ambitions without it. It made the recommendation that Wylfa should be the location for the next gigawatt-scale nuclear generation plant after Sizewell C.",
            "However, the land is currently owned by Hitachi, which bought it in 2012 and pulled out of a formerly proposed Wylfa B plan in 2020 after being unable to secure funding. The Welsh Affairs Committee said in its report that “it is unclear what the current state of play is at the site” and called on the government to “encourage Hitachi to sell the Wylfa Newydd site or take part in a consortium of developers to allow future development”.",
            "The government has now responded to the report’s recommendations and said that it welcomes Hitachi’s stewardship and maintenance of the site and notes that any decision to sell it would be a commercial decision on the company’s part.",
            "It added: “We continue to have a positive relationship and strong dialogue with all nuclear site owners […] and remain in conversation with them about how to best enable and deliver on the government’s ambition for up to 24GW of nuclear energy by 2050.”",
            "The government said that the establishment of Great British Nuclear will support its considerations for gigawatt-scale nuclear projects, but that “no decisions have been taken over which technologies future projects will proceed with, or at which sites”.",
            "The Welsh Affairs Committee has taken this as a positive response but is demanding more progress in determining the plan for the Wylfa land.",
            "Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb MP said: “Wylfa is the next best nuclear site, after Sizewell C, to realise the UK Government’s nuclear energy ambitions. It is promising that there is a constructive and positive relationship between Ministers and Hitachi, but would like to see more progress in finding a buyer to crack on with creating a nuclear power plant.",
            "“Great British Nuclear, as called for and welcomed by our committee, is a strong and positive move by the UK Government to illustrate its commitment to the sector. Its response to our report today sets out some early priorities, and I look forward to learning of the successful SMR [small modular reactor] projects later this year.",
            "“We mustn’t lose momentum on the nuclear energy agenda, particularly given the enormous benefits it can provide for people and businesses across Wales.”",
            "The government’s response repeatedly acknowledges the need for a revision to the National Policy Statement for nuclear deployment, which was published in 2011. It is currently working on the new document, which will “set out the planning policy for deploying new nuclear power stations beyond 2025” and “take account of the changes in the nuclear landscape”. It is expected to go to consultation this year."

            "The Welsh Affairs Committee has asked for clarity on a proposed nuclear project in Anglesey, Wales in the upcoming spring budget which is due to be announced on 15 March.",
            "Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station was originally earmarked for development by the government in 2010 but was stalled after Horizon Nuclear Power, original owners of the project, officially withdrew its planning application for the £20bn power station at Wylfa in January 2021 after funding challenges.",
            "In a letter to the prime minister Rishi Sunak ahead of the spring budget, seen by NCE, Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb has called for the next nuclear power station, after Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C, to be built at Wylfa.",
            "He further argues the government has made little progress on its ambitions laid out in the British Energy Security Strategy, released in April 2022.",
            "Crabb said: “The UK Government’s British Energy Security Strategy sent positive demand signals to the nuclear energy sector. But since its publication in April last year, we have heard very little as to how the target to generate 24GW of nuclear energy by 2050 will be accomplished.\"",
            "In his letter, Crabb adds claims that government advisor on establishing Great British Nuclear, which was a key part of the Energy Strategy on nuclear, Simon Bowen, told his committee that “it will be disastrous if we waited another two years” because the “whole of the industry will lose faith” and that “we’ve got to have the courage to take an inter-generational view […] for low carbon and net zero”.",
            "Crabb added: “Nuclear energy could hold the answer to reliable baseload as we transition away from oil and gas. With mounting household bills and the spiralling costs of fossil fuels, there is a unique opportunity to galvanise the low-carbon energy sectors. Instead, the nuclear energy sector has been waiting to know the ‘when and where’ for nuclear power stations in the UK.\"",
            "In the letter, Crabb also said: \"The [Energy] Strategy named Wylfa as a potential site for a new nuclear project. Since then, we have heard of growing concerns of a loss of momentum in delivery of the government’s Strategy and consequently, further uncertainty over the future of the Wylfa site.",
            "\"We have heard from a wide range of industry representatives that Wylfa is considered the best site in the UK for new nuclear development. Indeed, it is difficult to see how government can deliver its nuclear ambitions without taking forward a project at Wylfa. There is a strong view within the committee that Wylfa should be the next large scale site in line after Sizewell C so that North Wales can benefit from the economic impacts of a large-scale infrastructure project, which will bring highly skilled and well-paid long term job opportunities to a rural area of the UK.",
            "\"We have heard strong calls from the finance and skills sectors as well as from technology developers for a programme for nuclear which sets out which technology  - large scale or small modular reactors -  the government wants to be built, where and when.",
            "\"The majority of members of the committee are of the view that the Great British Nuclear arms-length body should be launched as soon as possible, with a mandate to deliver such a programme, in order to provide much needed clarity to the whole industry.\"",
            "Although the original plans by Horizon Nuclear Power, which is a subsidiary of Hitachi, have been withdrawn, a consortium including engineering firm Bechtel and reactor maker Westinghouse have been in talks with government over an alternative proposal since 2020. The latest plans for Wylfa involve building two AP1000 reactors, which is a different reactor design to the EPR being used at Hinkley Point C, which is also planned for Sizewell C.",
            "In May 2022, the consortium released cost estimates which could see the power plant built for between £14bn and £17bn."

            "US TerraPower executives, including Chairman Bill Gates took part in the groundbreaking ceremony of the company’s planned Natrium reactor facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming. Also attending the ceremony were TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque, and government representatives as well as South Korean officials including SK Group Vice Chairman Yoo Jung-joon and SK Executive Vice President Kim Moo-hwan.",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower selected an ageing coal plant in Kemmerer owned by US PacifiCorp as the preferred site for the demonstration project. The site is adjacent to PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant, which will stop burning coal in 2026 and natural gas a decade later, according to the utility. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The construction project is expected to cost up to $4bn, half funded by the ARDP. The company has raised about $1bn, including investments from Gates as well as South Korea-based SK Inc and SK Innovation, according to PitchBook. DOE has provided long-standing support for TerraPower’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D. This resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology.",
            "According to the TerraPower website, the ARDP authorises a 50/50 cost share and authorises up to $2bn for the Natrium project. “TerraPower and partners will match this investment dollar for dollar. The first-of-a-kind cost for the Natrium demonstration plant will include the reactor design and licensing, codes and methods development, fuel development and qualification, and the design, construction and operation of two supporting facilities: the Natrium Fuel Fabrication Facility and Sodium Test and Fill Facility. The sodium facility will be used to test and demonstrate the performance of first-of-a-kind equipment prior to operations in the reactor plant.”",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in May accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for review, marking the first time in more than 40 years that the NRC has docketed this type of application for a commercial non-light water reactor. TerraPower’s current work is to have the site ready to build the reactor as soon as the company receives a the final construction permit from NRC.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer, is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030.",
            "Bill Gates, discussing the ground-breaking ceremony on his",
            "personal blog, claims: “Kemmerer, Wyoming will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world.”",
            "He says: “The plant was designed by TerraPower, a company I started in 2008. But my nuclear journey started several years earlier, when I first read a scientific paper for a new type of nuclear power plant. The design was far safer than any existing plant, with the temperatures held under control by with the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes. It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night. As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it— and revolutionize how we generate power in the US and around the world…. But that technology was just an idea in a lab and on a computer screen until today.”",
            "Gates expects the NRC review process to take a couple of years. “So in the meantime, TerraPower will continue to build the non-nuclear parts of the facility”. Construction will begin next year on the so-called “energy island,” which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit. (The reactor will eventually be part of a “nuclear island,” and the team hopes to start building that in 2026.)” He adds: “While these first-of-a-kind projects can be big and risky, they are too important for our future to fail to act.”",
            "In an earlier blog in May 2023, Gates provides some more comments on the reactor technology. “Like other power plant designs, it uses heat to turn water into steam, which moves a turbine, which generates electricity. And like other nuclear facilities, it generates the heat by splitting uranium atoms in a chain reaction. But that’s pretty much where the similarities stop.”",
            "He continues: “A typical reactor keeps the atom-splitting nuclear reaction under control by circulating water around a uranium core. But using water as a coolant presents two challenges. First, water isn’t very good at absorbing heat — it turns to steam and stops absorbing heat at just 100 degrees C. Second, as water gets hot, its pressure goes up, which puts strain on your pipes and other equipment. If there’s an emergency — say, an earthquake cuts off all the electricity to the plant and you can’t keep pumping water — the core continues to make heat, raising the pressure and potentially causing an explosion.”",
            "He therefore believes liquid metal is a better coolant than water. “The Natrium plant uses liquid sodium, whose boiling point is more than eight times higher than water’s, so it can absorb all the extra heat generated in the nuclear core. Unlike water, the sodium doesn’t need to be pumped, because as it gets hot, it rises, and as it rises, it cools off. Even if the plant loses power, the sodium just keeps absorbing heat without getting to a dangerous temperature that would cause a meltdown.”",
            "On the plant’s molten salt energy storage system, he says this will allow the Natrium facility to control how much electricity it produces at any given time. “That’s unique among nuclear reactors, and it’s essential for integrating with power grids that use variable sources like solar and wind.”",
            "He also extols TerraPower’s digital design process. “Using supercomputers, they’ve digitally tested the Natrium design countless times, simulating every imaginable disaster, and it keeps holding up. TerraPower’s sophisticated work has drawn interest from around the globe, including an agreement to collaborate on nuclear power technology in Japan and investments from the South Korean conglomerate SK and the multinational steel company ArcelorMittal.”",
            "While the TerraPower website provides some details of work done with molten salt, it contains very little information about the reactor technology. According to a video: “In the reactor building, advanced uranium fuel is inserted into an enclosed container and covered with liquid sodium. A chain reaction starts when uranium atoms slit and release neutrons and heat the metal coolant inside the reactor system…. The liquid sodium is heated and then transfers thermal energy to pipes filled with molten salt. This… then travels to a very large storage tank that serves as a thermal battery for the plant…. The molten salt passes near water-filled tubes and boils the water to make super heated steam. This… then helps to turn a turbine, creating electricity…. The molten salt is transferred to a cold tank and eventually back to the nuclear island.”",
            "Basically the Natrium reactor is a sodium-cooled fast reactora. Currently, the only commercially operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029 and probably qualifies as the most advanced reactor facility in the world.",
            "While research on fast reactors took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, things began to change in the late 1970s as concerns about scarce uranium resources waned and public opinion became increasingly hostile in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the USA and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. By the early 1990s the US, the UK and Germany had closed down their programmes. France continued with its Phenix and SuperPhenix projects for a few more years, finally closing SuperPhenix in 1998 and Phenix in 2009, Subsequently, in 2019, France also cancelled the Generation IV ASTRID sodium-cooled fast reactor demonstrator design project. Although interest is now reviving in Europe and the USA both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the early design phase and is probably decades away from implementation.",
            "As an example, India’s prototype sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor began fuel loading in March. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) began to design the reactor in 1980 and construction began in 2004, 24 years later. It was originally expected to be commissioned in 2010 but suffered a series of delays over the next 14 years."

The aim is to begin detailed site analysis for final site selection in 2025. A final decision on approving an SMR, however, is not expected before 2029. Officials have said early planning is required to ensure the province meets regulations. If it is approved, the SMR could be operational by 2035.",

The other location was the Elbow area located next to Lake Diefenbaker.",
            "Dustin Duncan, the minister responsible for SaskPower, said two sites identified for further study are the Boundary Dam Reservoir and the Rafferty Reservoir, both of which are located about 10 kilometres away from the city of Estevan, in southeastern Saskatchewan. Detailed assessments of both sites will now begin, including the collection of ground water and geotechnical. Saskpower said detailed land and water analyses will be undertaken to collect data to help identify a final site while protecting the natural environment by minimising impacts to sensitive lands and habitats.",
            "Duncan said Elbow, northwest of Regina, was still under consideration but because Estevan has more existing power infrastructure the nearby reservoirs are better options. SaskPower will continue to seek land options in the region and work with Rightsholders, Indigenous and municipal leaders and community members.",
            "“In addition to the technical suitability of the sites, the Estevan region offers many benefits, including proximity to the City of Estevan to access existing services, a skilled workforce, accommodations and emergency services, as well as infrastructure, roads and transmission,” SaskPower President and CEO Rupen Pandya said. “Selecting a site for the first SMR facility will allow us to proceed with the many regulatory processes which are site-specific and critical to the project moving forward.”",
            "Estevan is home to two of SaskPower’s three coal-fired power plants, totalling over 800 MWe of capacity, but a federal ruling means all conventional coal units are to be phased out by 2030, by when they must either retire or convert to carbon capture and storage. Only one of SaskPower’s coal-fired units – 120 MWe unit at the three-unit Boundary Dam Power station – has been equipped with such technology.",
            "Saskatchewan does not currently use nuclear power but SMR technology has been under consideration since the publication of a provincial roadmap in 2019. In June 2022, SaskPower selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMR for potential deployment of the first unit by 2034, with another to potentially follow shortly after at the same facility. OPG had already selected the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 for their Darlington New Nuclear Project in Ontario with a target of completion by 2028.",

            "Framatome North America and US-based TerraPower have agreed to design and develop a high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) metallisation pilot line at Framatome’s nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Richland, Washington. The HALEU pilot line, which is currently under construction, will prove the viability of Framatome’s technology for metallisation to support the development of the advanced reactor market.",
            "The USA’s current commercial nuclear fuel cycle is based on low-enriched uranium enriched to less than 5%. HALEU, enriched to between 5% and 20% is required by many of the advanced reactor technologies that are currently under development. As yet no US domestic commercial source of HALEU available although Centrus is developing a HALEU production facility supported by the Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "DOE is pursuing various pathways to produce HALEU through its HALEU Availability Program (HAP), authorised by the Energy Act of 2020. The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in 2022 included $700m to support HALEU development. Framatome has applied for DOE funding under the HAP Deconversion and Metallisation Request for Proposals. Successful completion and operation of the HALEU pilot plant will support Framatome’s efforts to expand the US fuel supply chain capabilities.",
            "Metallisation of HALEU is a crucial part of the HALEU fuel cycle. After enrichment, HALEU uranium hexafluoride must be “deconverted” to a form suitable for fuel fabrication. These include oxides, metal and alloys, nitrides and carbides. While this is traditionally done in fuel fabrication facilities, deconversion of HALEU enriched to more than 10% has to take place in a physical security Category II facility.",
            "“A strong domestic fuel supply chain is crucial for the wide-scale deployment of advanced nuclear energy solutions; an energy source we know is needed to meet clean energy targets and provide reliable, baseload energy,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower President & CEO. “This investment by TerraPower into Framatome’s pilot line is a critical step in bringing advanced reactors like the Natrium technology to market. It is also one more way that TerraPower is delivering on its promise to do our part to support the fuel manufacturing sector.”",
            "Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by DOE. The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for its Natrium reactor demonstration project.",
            "“This agreement advances fuel technologies for the nuclear energy industry and working pragmatically with TerraPower builds the trust and confidence our customers count on,” said Ala Alzaben, Senior Vice President for North America Fuel at Framatome. “TerraPower is at the forefront of the next generation of advanced reactors and by utilizing our expertise and flexible manufacturing infrastructure, we can ensure new clean nuclear projects are not waiting on the supply chain of nuclear fuels.”"

        "title": "IEEFA report critiques feasibility of small modular reactors",
        "text": [
            "A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has assessed the feasibility of deploying small modular nuclear reactors to meet increasing energy demands around the world. The report, “Small Modular Reactors: Still Too Expensive, Too Slow, and Too Risky” asks if continuing to pursue small NPPs is worthwhile in terms of meeting increasing global energy demands. demand for more energy around the globe.",
            "The 23-page report notes: “The rhetoric from small modular reactor (SMR) advocates is loud and persistent: This time will be different because the cost overruns and schedule delays that have plagued large reactor construction projects will not be repeated with the new designs,” says the report. “But the few SMRs that have been built (or have been started) paint a different picture – one that looks startlingly similar to the past. Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "On costs, the report looks at three operating SMRs worldwide—two in Russia [possibly just one – the Akademik Lomonosov, which has two reactors] and one in China, the demonstration High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) at the Shidaowan site in Shandong province. It also considers a fourth – the CAREM-25 SMR under construction in Argentina.",
            "It says costs for all four [three] have been significantly higher than originally planned. “The takeaway is that the projected costs significantly understated actual construction expenditures.” However, the report does not take into account that these are all first-of-a-kind (FOAK) designs and have become the basis of further plants. Russia is already building several SMRs (both floating and land based) in almost series production using upgraded reactors based on the Akademik Lomosonov experience, the costs of which will be greatly reduced. China’s HTR-PM has become the basis for a novel district heating scheme and a larger HTGR is now being developed based on this experience. The CAREM 25 has faced delays and cost overruns but is now expected to begin operation in 2027. Both Russia and Argentina expect their designs to be the basis for lucrative exports in the future.",
            "IEEFA says two other SMRs currently under construction in China and Russia are also years behind schedule. “Russia’s BREST-300 lead-cooled reactor is now scheduled for completion in 2026, even though announcements in the early 2010s had indicated it would be operational by 2018. Similarly, China’s ACP100, a 125MW pressurized water SMR that has been under development since the early 2010s, is now not scheduled to begin commercial operation until 2026.” These are also FOAK designs for which delays are par for the course and will ultimately offer opportunities for replication and exports.",
            "IEEFA notes that similar significant cost increases have occurred at proposed projects in the US, citing the cancellation of NuScale’s planned facility in Idaho in cooperation with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "The report notes: “NuScale’s problems are not unique. US SMR developers have consistently sought to shield their construction cost estimates, but information about two other prominent projects shows that the estimated costs for these projects also have skyrocketed. The cost increases for the X-Energy and GE-Hitachi SMR projects occurred well before either had secured licensing approval from NRC [National Regulatory Authority], let alone begun construction. IEEFA believes this should be a red flag for utilities, regulators and investors.",
            "IEEFA says the cost debate “inevitably includes Westinghouse, the developer of the two AP1000 reactors recently brought online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle nuclear facility”, which was more than $20bn over budget and took more than six years longer to complete than forecast. “Undaunted by that debacle, Westinghouse has now jumped into the SMR market, introducing a 300MW unit (the AP300) that it says it can build for $3,333 per kW- even though the final cost of the Vogtle reactors was more than $20,000 per kW in 2023-year dollars. Even if Westinghouse’s projected AP300 cost is just an overnight estimate that excludes escalation and financing costs, that is a spectacular projected cost reduction for a facility that is still not licensed and far from breaking ground for construction.”",
            "In terms of the projects being “too slow”, the report, referring to the same projects, notes that they all took longer to build than planned. Again, with respect to the Russian and Chinese plants, this was not a real consideration as it is expected for FOAK projects.",
            "However, for those still in the design stage, IEEFA may have a point. “Despite this real-world experience, Westinghouse, X-Energy and NuScale, among others, continue to claim they will be able to construct their SMRs in 36 to 48 months, perhaps quickly enough to have them online by 2030,” the report notes. “GE-Hitachi even claims it ultimately will be able to construct its 300MW facility in as little as 24 months. Admittedly, there is a not-zero chance this is possible, but it flies in the face of nuclear industry experience, both in terms of past SMR development and construction efforts and the larger universe of full-size reactors, all of which have taken significantly longer than projected to begin commercial operation.”",
            "As to the projects being “too risky”, IEEFA simply says the cost increases and construction delays that have plagued the SMR sector already “will push enormous financial and time risks onto",
            "customers, potentially undercutting their interest and ability in pursuing such projects. Aware of these risk-related problems, the Department of Energy has floated several ideas to get the government involved in the buildout of the SMR sector. These include providing “cost overrun insurance,” other undefined financial assistance, becoming an owner or serving as a buyer for the power. None of these options would reduce the development risk—they would simply transfer those risks and the associated costs to US taxpayers",
            "In conclusion, IEEFA says it released its first analysis of the SMR sector more than two years ago, “concluding that the much-hyped resource would be too slow, too expensive and too risky to help in the transition away from fossil fuels”. It added: “We stand by that conclusion.”",
            "The report notes: “Perhaps most concerning is the risk factor, especially when compared to the known costs and construction timelines for readily available wind, solar and battery storage resources. … At least 375,000 MW of new renewable energy generating capacity is likely to be added to the US grid in the next seven years. By contrast, IEEFA believes it is highly unlikely any SMRs will be brought online in that same time frame. The comparison couldn’t be clearer. Regulators, utilities, investors and government officials should acknowledge this and embrace the available reality: Renewables are the near-term solution.”",
            "The report makes several recommendations:",
            "Regulators who will be asked to approve utility or developer-backed SMR proposals should craft restrictions to prevent delays and cost increases from being pushed onto ratepayers.",
            "Utilities that are considering SMRs should be required to compare the technology’s uncertain costs and completion dates with the known costs and construction timetables of renewable alternatives. Utilities that still opt for the SMR option should be required to put shareholder funds at risk if costs and construction times exceed utility estimates.",
            "Investors and bankers weighing any SMR proposal should carefully conduct their due diligence. Things will go wrong, imperiling the chances for full recovery of any invested funds.",
            "State and federal governments should require that estimated SMR construction costs and schedules be publicly available so that utility ratepayers, taxpayers and investors are better able to assess the magnitude of the SMR-related financial risks that they may be forced to bear.",
            "Finally, it is vital that this debate consider the opportunity costs associated with the SMR push. The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years—years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.",
            "IEEFA says its mission “is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy”. It adds that its market-based research “shows how the rise of the new energy economy, where renewable energy sources are steadily eroding reliance on fossil fuels, makes financial sense for investors, governments, businesses, communities and ratepayers”.",
            "In line with this mission, the new report says: “The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years – years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.”"

In March, Great British Nuclear (GBN) the arms-length body set up by the government to help deliver that extra capacity, acquired the Hitachi-owned sites for new nuclear at Wylfa and at Oldbury-on-Severn in southwest England for £160m ($203m).

The plan was to develop two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactor units at Wylfa Newydd. In 2012, the Japanese company Hitachi offered to buy Horizon in a £700m deal spurring hopes that up to 6,000 jobs would be created during the construction phase, and 1,200 long-term jobs. However, in 2019 the plans faltered, with Hitachi citing spiralling costs.

        "text": [
            "Impressive recent growth in the SMR project pipeline is just one more element of a tidal wave forming for the next great nuclear breakthrough.",
            "In the first quarter of 2024 the small nuclear reactor (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW. This, according to a new report from analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, represents growth of some 65% in the three years since 2021.",
            "Noting that just five countries lead the project pipeline – Canada, the Korean Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States are driving some 58% of those projects – the WoodMac analysis adds that even the current global project pipeline would require an investment of close to US$176bn.",
            "It’s clearly a substantial growth rate and is backed by serious investment, even if the whole extent of the current pipeline never reaches a positive final investment decision. And it’s a district possibility, if not outright probability, that such a situation may come to pass as some of these projects fall by the wayside. After all, there are obvious risks to consider, particularly in light of the high profile NuScale retrenchment. As an industry leader – and still the only SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – NuScale had been widely seen as something of a flag-bearer for this burgeoning new nuclear industry.",
            "It’s understandable then that the decision to abandon the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) being developed in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) was taken by many as a significant blow to the credibility of SMRs as a whole.",
            "However, to reach that conclusion would undoubtedly be an ill-considered approach. NuScale may have taken a step backwards, but it is hardly in full-blown retreat. Almost immediately after the CFPP decision was announced Standard Power revealed plans to work with NuScale to develop two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Standard business is as a provider of services to data companies and this may be taken as a giant neon sign pointing to at least one of the underlying drivers behind a global SMR boom. The unabated growth of energy-hungry data centres is likely to see an early and productive partnership between the two industries. They certainly won’t be alone though, given Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also the founder of Terrapower with its 345 MWe Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor technology.",
            "There’s other clear evidence of gathering momentum behind an SMR-led nuclear market too. With multiple policy initiatives reflecting a new appraisal of nuclear in general, there are also SMR-specific government-backed measures designed to push SMR technologies off the drawing board and into operation. Important regulatory efforts underway include the US NRC, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) recently signing a trilateral deal to collaborate on SMR and advanced modular reactor (AMR) design assessment. The agreement is designed to enable both good practice and experience of reviewing SMR/AMR designs to be shared between the regulators. All three bodies are already engaged with SMR design assessment – the NRC is conducting pre-application activities with Westinghouse regarding design certification for its AP300 SMR, as well as with Holtec International for its SMR 300, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear for licensing approval of its BWRX-300 design, for example. This new measure marks an important step toward a unified regulatory framework that is so important to the success of SMRs that are expected to be deployed in many different jurisdictions.",
            "Given the underlying fundamentals it’s perhaps not so surprising that in their net zero scenario, WoodMac sees SMRs accounting for around a third of the global nuclear fleet. It’s not a cloudless horizon, inevitably there are both economic and technical risks and challenges that must be overcome and to do so will require a long-term concerted effort from government, regulators and the private sector. But taken in the round there is every indication that the 65% growth in the project pipeline seen over the last three years will come to be regarded as a pretty poor show in the years that follow."

            "The fuel rods were manufactured at GNF’s fabrication facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, with support from the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) programme. They were later inserted into a commercial reactor for testing, where they completed three full cycles of operation. ORNL will examine the fuel and verify its safety and performance. The post-irradiation experiments will continue for several years. The results will be used to support the development, engineering, and licensing efforts of GNF’s fuel.",
            "“This fuel shipment to Oak Ridge National Laboratory is an important step in GNF’s efforts to commercialise their high burn-up fuel,” said Frank Goldner, a nuclear engineer within DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy. “High burn-up fuels are expected to enhance the performance of today’s reactors and will help us on our path to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.”",
            "GE Vernova’s Nuclear energy business, through its global alliance with Hitachi, provides nuclear fuel bundles, services, and advanced nuclear reactor designs. Technologies include boiling water reactors and small modular reactors, such as the BWRX-300. GE Vernova’s Nuclear fuel business, GNF, supplies boiling water reactor fuel and fuel-related engineering services. GNF is a GE Vernova-led joint venture with Hitachi and operates primarily through Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas in Wilmington and Global Nuclear Fuel-Japan Co in Kurihama, Japan."

The deal should close after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approves the transfer including licence transfer from GEH to NorthStar and all other conditions.",
            "“Our team has developed deep experience in the safe and efficient decontamination, decommissioning, and restoration of former nuclear reactor sites across the country, including the successful implementation of NRC Licence Termination Plans at five other research reactor sites nationwide,” said NorthStar CEO Scott State.",
            "The agreement under which NorthStar will become the NRC-licensed owner of the research reactor complex, is modelled on NorthStar’s acquisition of the former Vermont Yankee NPP approved by NRC and state regulators in 2018. NorthStar’s decommissioning at Vermont Yankee is currently ahead of schedule for on-budget completion by 2026.",
            "NorthStar will take over the decommissioning work that GEH has already started at the Vallecitos boiling water reactor, which was the first US privately owned and operated NPP to deliver electricity to a public utility grid. The site also includes a number of other test reactors, laboratories and hot cell facilities. NorthStar will restore the site to conditions suitable for commercial or industrial use. NorthStar anticipates being able to dispose of low-level radioactive waste from the Vallecitos decommissioning at the disposal facility operated by NorthStar affiliate Waste Control Specialists in Andrews County, Texas.",
            "NorthStar, through its Accelerated Decommissioning Partners joint venture, is also decommissioning the Crystal River 3 nuclear reactor complex in Florida under a contract with Duke Energy, following NRC and state regulatory approval in 2020.",
            "The 1,600‑acre Vallecitos Nuclear Centre is a nuclear research facility and site of a former owned by GEH. The NPP operated from 1957 until 1963. From 1965 to 1975, the facility was used to conduct research for the Atomic Energy Commission’s Nuclear Energy Programme and the civilian nuclear power industry. AEC is a predecessor to the Department of Energy (DOE). Research was also undertaken between 1981 and 1982. DOE contract work was subsequently discontinued.",
            "Waste removal from the Vallecitos centre tooke place in 2009 and 2010. Most of the nuclear waste generated from the decontamination work was transuranic waste (TRU) that consisted of clothing, tools, rags, debris, and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive TRU. The TRU waste was packaged and shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico, for permanent disposal."

            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe liquid sodium-cooled fast reactor with a separate molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners. Natrium is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, and recent moves to ban imports of Russian enriched uranium, however, have made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date was therefore pushed to 2030.",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. In March, NRC issued new guidance documents to facilitate the licensing of non-light water reactor designs. The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies.",
            "According to Reuters, fuel supply remains TerraPower’s main concern for the first plant, on which the company expects to begin non-nuclear-related construction in June. Director of External Affairs at TerraPower Jeff Navin said the supply of HALEU was considered the greatest uncertainty when planning for deployment. “We still think 2030 is our best bet as to when we can get things completed, but I can’t tell you today that I can account for every kilogram of HALEU that we will need, where it will come from, and when we’ll have it, so that that is certainly something that still keeps us up at night.”",
            "Plans for US-produced fuel are being expedited, including a two-phase project to produce 900 kg of HALEU a year by the nuclear fuel and services company, Centrus. In November 2023, Centrus announced its first delivery of 20 kilograms of HALEU uranium hexafluoride (UF6), completing Phase 1 of the HALEU Operation Contract under budget and ahead of schedule. Centrus has so far achieved cumulative deliveries to the DOE of approximately 135 kilograms of HALEU. However, this is not enough.",
            "“We feel very confident that there will be multiple enrichers making HALEU in the United States in the future,” said Navin. “The question is how quickly they will be put in place for us to meet our initial core load for our first reactor. We just need more centrifuges spinning as quickly as possible to increase the amount of HALEU that’s commercially available.”"

            "Rolls-Royce SMR has reportedly revised its plans to build two nuclear factories in the UK due ongoing delays in the government’s small modular reactor (SMR) design competition. In December 2023, six SMR designs were selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK The winning bidders were EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK The contracts were expected to be awarded in spring 2024 but this has now been postponed to June 2024 at the earliest.",
            "Rolls-Royce had planned two separate factories: one for heavy pressure vessels, critical components for reactors, and another for assembling the modular units of the SMRs. A shortlist for the pressure vessel factory included the International Advanced Manufacturing Park on the outskirts of Sunderland, as well as the Gateway industrial park in Deeside, Wales.",
            "However, Rolls-Royce says it no longer has time to build it and make the first pressure vessels by the early 2030s when it had hoped to launch its first SMRs. Rolls-Royce will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third-party supplier. Plans for the second factory will still go ahead. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce SMR told the Daily Telegraph that the company had now “prioritised work on our modules assembly and test facility”. It added: “Our efforts are focused on identifying the best site to support our deployment at pace.”",
            "The sites considered for the pressure vessel factory could now be shortlisted for the second plant, but no decision has yet been made. The company may revive plans for a heavy pressure vessel factory sometime in the future, provided that it manages to build up a robust pipeline of orders. A UK government spokesman said: “Our world leading SMR competition aims to be the fastest of its kind, helping secure billions in investment for the UK, meaning cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term.”",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWt. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK.",

The application makes the case that the benefits of clean, firm, flexible power from the LFR-AS-200 would far outweigh any potential risks. NIA says these are” rigorously controlled by robust safety features, including passive safety systems, built into the design and incorporated into the operating arrangements, in line with the UK’s regulatory requirements”.",
            "The application also argues that the reactor design would support nuclear energy’s contribution to a stable and well-balanced electricity grid, which is essential to reduce consumer bills and maintain economic competitiveness.",

A justification decision is one of the required steps for the operation of a new nuclear technology in the UK, but it is not a permit or licence that allows a specific project to go ahead. It is a generic decision based on a high-level evaluation of the potential benefits and detriments of the proposed new nuclear practice as a pre-cursor to future regulatory processes.",
            "This is the first ever application for justification of an advanced nuclear technology in the UK. The government has confirmed that the application has been accepted for consideration, and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) will support the Secretary of State in their role as the justifying authority responsible for the justification decision.",
            "NIA CEO Tom Greatrex said advanced reactors such as newcleo’s design “have enormous potential to support the UK’s energy security and net zero transition, so we were delighted to apply for this decision”. He added: “This is an opportunity for the UK Government to demonstrate that it backs advanced nuclear technologies to support a robust clean power mix and to reinvigorate the UK’s proud tradition of nuclear innovation. We look forward to engaging with the Government and the public throughout this process and to further applications for new nuclear designs in the future.”",
            "Stefano Buono, newcleo CEO said this was “an important milestone in our development programme and a vital step forward in our delivery plan for the UK”. He added: “We continue to progress our UK plans at pace – aiming to deliver our first of a kind commercial reactor in the UK by 2033. We are but one player in the new nuclear renaissance and we look forward to working with government and the rest of the sector to develop the robust supply chain that can deliver the UK’s ambition of 24GW of nuclear power by 2050.”",

            "SRS is a chemical petrochemical engineering company with nuclear fuel cycle experience “having already been involved in 24 LFR projects, becoming the world leader in reactor lead cooling technology”. According to the SRS website, these projects include France’s Superphénix reactor; the European fast reactor (EFR) project; the European sodium-cooled fast reactor – smart (ESFR-SMART), France’s ASTRID; the European Lead Fast Reactor under the ELSY (European Lead SYstem) project; the EU’s Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) conceptual design; and the Generation IV International Forum’s LFR.",
            "However, Superphénix which operated from 1986-1996 was closed in face of protests and technical problems. Plans to construct Astrid were cancelled in 2019. Moreover, both these projects were sodium-cooled not lead cooled fast reactors. The other projects mentioned were simply conceptual designs.",
            "Newcleo says its mission “is to generate safe, clean, economic and practically inexhaustible energy for the world, through a radically innovative combination of existing, accessible technologies”. It claims to “capitalise on 30 years of R&D activity in metal-cooled fast reactors and liquid-lead cooling systems. Newcleo says its reactor design “has been optimised over the last 20 years leading to the concept of an ultra-compact and transportable 200 MWe module with improvements in energy density compared to other technologies”.",
            "Currently, however, the only operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029. As yet, despite its rapidly growing list of acquisitions and co-operation agreements and optimistic timeline, newcleo’s technology remains in the very early conceptual design stage.",

        "text": [
            "US-based TerraPower has submitted its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. This is the first application to NRC for construction of a commercial advanced reactor.",
            "TerraPower says it has been working closely with NRC in pre-application meetings and is confident in its application. Non-nuclear construction will begin on the Natrium reactor demonstration project this summer and nuclear construction will begin only after the application is approved by NRC.",
            "“We will continue working closely with local stakeholders, elected officials and regulatory partners as we begin non-nuclear construction this year while working through this application process with the NRC,” said Chris Levesque, President & CEO of TerraPower. “This milestone is one of many that paves the way toward clean, reliable and flexible power for the grid and long-term jobs for the Kemmerer community.”",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",
            "In March, NRC issued new guidance documents to facilitate the licensing of non-light water reactor designs. The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies. DOE said this was good news for advanced reactor vendors, including two DOE demonstration projects with TerraPower and X-energy. Both companies are applying this guidance to their construction permit applications. Both projects are being managed through DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.",
            "TerraPower has received significant and constant DOE support for its Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D that resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University.",
            "In 2019, the MCFR design team reported a major milestone with 1,000 hours of isothermal loop operations. The MCFR technology will utilise liquid salt as both fuel and coolant in the reactor core. This fully pumped molten salt loop tested key components including pumps, heaters, freeze valves, flanges, and instrumentation over time.",
            "In 2020, DOE selected the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) proposal, with Southern Company as the lead, as a winner of the ARDP risk-reduction pathway. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology. In February 2022, TerraPower and Southern Company finalised an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE at Idaho National Laboratory under the ARDP.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years.",
            "The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030. Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more than 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.”",
            "Nevertheless, US PacifiCorp, owner of the Kemmerer site, in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) considered the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities. TerraPower says it remains confident that the US supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035.",

            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report: ‘",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets",
            "’ which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector’s progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale’s pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance.",
            "It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale’s VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "Above: Relative latecomers are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector’s early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

The event was hosted at the Korean Embassy in London by Ambassador Yoon Yeocheol and attended by UK Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to Korea, Sir John Whittingdale MP.",
            "The partnerships are a further step towards delivery of Holtec’s SMR-300 technology in the UK. The SMR-300 is a pressurised water reactor (PWR) using technology based on existing standards in the US and UK and uses PWR fuel similar to that already used at Sizewell B, and other new UK reactors under development including Hinkley Point C. Holtec has been developing its SMR since 2011. The SMR-300 has undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "In December 2023, Holtec Britain was awarded £30m ($37.6m) of grant funding from the UK government’s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to complete Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of the SMR-300, which was also shortlisted by Great British Nuclear (GBN) at the end of October 2023. The other five short-listed companies are Rolls Royce SMR, EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. If successful in the Great British Nuclear SMR competition, Holtec plans to establish a factory in the UK to build the major mechanical SMR components and support other aligned manufacturing needs in clean energy and defence sectors.",
            "Holtec says an exercise to find the best location for a factory will be launched in the coming weeks. If established, the factory will support deployment of 5 GW of on-grid UK electricity from SMR-300 by 2050 and create a major export hub. Holtec Britain’s Senior Advisor, Professor Dame Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge stated, “Holtec is committed to delivering SMRs in the UK creating high-value well-paid jobs and providing clean energy to help us reach net zero. This agreement is another important step on this journey.”",
            "“Based on our strong partnership with Holtec, we have prepared for the GBN SMR competition with top-tier UK construction company Balfour Beatty and world class engineering firm Mott MacDonald, giving us even more confidence in our ability to successfully win the contract and execute the project,” said Young-Joon Yoon, President & CEO and of Hyundai E&C.",
            "Balfour Beatty Group CEO Leo Quinn, said SMRs can offer a more flexible, scalable solution. He added that the partnership “is perfectly positioned to address the growing demand for clean energy in the UK and support the UK’s transition towards a Net Zero future”.",
            "Cathy Travers, Group Managing Director of Mott MacDonald said: “International collaboration from across the nuclear industry is key to its successful deployment, which is why we are bringing decades of collective experience to bear as we explore this path with Holtec Britain and Hyundai E&C.”",
            "Gareth Thomas, Director of Holtec Britain told Reuters: \"Holtec will be investing approximately £600m in the construction, design and build of a new factory and production site over the next 15 years.\" Local authorities and businesses will be invited to submit expressions of interest to host the factory, outlining which sites could be available and how ready they would be for work to start on the factory. The factory could provide around 400 highly-skilled jobs in the next three-to-five years, Thomas said. Holtec already has an SMR factory in New Jersey in the USA, but believes a UK site could provide a base to export its technology to Europe and the Middle East.",

            "As part of his recent UK budget statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “I can announce that this week the government has reached agreement on a £160m ($203m) deal with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site in Ynys Môn and the Oldbury site in South Gloucestershire.” This was confirmed in paragraph 5.120 of the Budget Statement. Hunt said the purchase had been made \"given the importance of securing nuclear sites for the success of the nuclear programme\".",
            "In January 2021, Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power notified the UK Planning Inspectorate that it was withdrawing its application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey where it had planned to construct a nuclear power plant with two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors. The £20bn project had been expected to provide employment and business opportunities for the region.",
            "Hitachi had announced the suspension of the project in January 2019 and its intent to withdraw entirely in September 2020. In light of this, and in the absence of a new funding policy from HM Government, Hitachi decided to wind-up Horizon as an active development entity by 31 March 2021. Hitachi continued to manage the site under the control of its subsidiary Hitachi Europe Limited. \"This will be done with a view to considering development proposals from commercial or public sector developers who may come forward, and Horizon will continue to support this intent until the end of March,” said Horizon CEO Duncan Hawthorne. “Beyond this period Hitachi Europe will remain available to respond to any parties who may have an interest in acquiring these sites.\"",
            "In his budget speech, Hunt added that, as well as seeking a site for a new large-scale NPP, \"the government is now moving to the next stage of the SMR process, with six companies invited to submit their initial tender responses by June this year\". He added that \"no decisions have been taken on projects\". The government earlier outlined plans to increase nuclear energy capacity to 24 GWe by 2050, with a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of that strategy. In 2023, the government and the new Great British Nuclear (GNB) arms-length body set up to help deliver extra nuclear capacity began the selection process for a suitable SMR technology. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of that process.",

            "Above: The basic assembly design of uranium oxide fuel pellets clad with zirconium alloy tubing has remained the fuel of choice for the vast majority of commercial nuclear power plants",
            "There is a growing interest worldwide in the development and deployment of accident tolerant fuels (ATFs). Accident tolerant fuels are included in a wider generic group of Advanced Technology Fuels. ATFs are seen to offer both safety and economic benefits for nuclear power reactors with many designs under consideration. They can be defined as fuels:",
            "That have potential to enhance the safety in case of a severe accident in a reactor core for a longer time than the current UO2-zirconium alloy fuel system",
            "That can maintain or improve fuel performance during normal operation and operational transients",
            "That are compatible with all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle (transport, storage, and possible use within a closed fuel cycle)",
            "ATFs mostly involve new cladding and fuel pellet designs that increase the performance and severe accident response times of nuclear fuel. They take advantage of new materials that reduce hydrogen build-up, improve fission production retention, and are structurally more resistant to radiation, corrosion, and higher temperatures. In addition, they are expected to last longer than current fuel designs and may extend the time between refuellings from 1.5 to 2 years for pressurised water reactors. This would reduce the amount of fuel assemblies needed, leading to less waste production and a reduction in fuel costs.",
            "Those technologies that are mature enough to start fuel qualification and achieve near-term deployment – within the coming decade in the existing fleet of light water reactors (LWRs) and in the LWR-based small modular reactor (SMR) designs – are termed “evolutionary accident tolerant fuels (eATFs)”. There are numerous designs and concepts that could be termed as eATFs, based on features such as enhanced cladding, modified uranium oxide fuel (including dopants), and increased enrichment.",
            "A great deal of research and development has been undertaken to support the introduction of eATFs into commercial nuclear power reactors, with the first eATFs entering service in 2021 as part of a number of test programmes. These tests support the economic and safety cases for reactor core operations and provide preliminary information to anticipate potential impacts on the back end of the fuel cycle when compared with traditional power reactor fuels. This includes during storage, transportation, reprocessing and recycling, and disposal.",
            "Nuclear fuel has been subject to continuous development over the past 40 years and has reached a stage where it can be safely and reliably irradiated up to 65 GWd/tU in commercial nuclear reactors. During this time, there have been many improvements to the original designs and materials, but the basic design of uranium oxide (UO2) fuel pellets clad with zirconium (Zr) alloy tubing has remained the fuel of choice for the vast majority of commercial nuclear power plants. However, severe accidents, such as those at the Three Mile Island plant in 1979 in the US and at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP in 2011 showed that, under extreme conditions, nuclear fuel will fail. Under certain circumstances, high temperature reactions between zirconium alloys and water will lead to the generation of hydrogen, with the potential for explosions to occur.",
            "During the earthquake and tsunami that seriously damaged the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, the reactors shut down immediately but fission products in the fuel continued to release decay heat. Zirconium alloys in the cladding of the fuel assemblies oxidise rapidly at temperatures a few hundred degrees higher than normal operating temperatures, leading to disintegration of the fuel rods and rapid corrosion of the cladding. This process released hydrogen causing explosions that further damaged the plant.",
            "This disaster prompted researchers to begin developing accident-tolerant fuel solutions which would allow more time before active cooling is required in a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or, even better, would be able to indefinitely withstand the sustained high temperatures created by decay heat and insufficient cooling, thus preventing or delaying the release of radionuclides during an accident.",
            "Research, focused mainly on the design of fuel pellets and cladding, as well as interactions between the two, almost immediately got under way in key nuclear countries such as the USA, Russia, France the UK, South Korea, Japan and China. This research has been supported by international bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).",
            "The IAEA has been supporting international co-operation among member states in fuel development since the 1980s, long before the Fukushima accident. This included efforts to enhance the capacities of computer codes used for predicting fuel behaviour, within the framework of Coordinated Research Projects (CRPs). However, the Fukushima accident demonstrated the need for adequate analysis of all aspects of fuel performance to prevent a failure and to predict fuel behaviour in accidents, as well as the need to test and model the behaviours of ATFs.",
            "The IAEA works through technical meetings, consultancy meetings, conferences, and CRP activity. Two CRPs were organised in the wake of Fukushima to focus on the modelling and testing of nuclear fuels and ATFs in design basis and severe accidents.",
            "The first CRP on “FUel Modelling in Accident Conditions (FUMAC)” (2014-2018) sought to better understand fuel behaviour in accident conditions by identifying best practices in the application of relevant physical models and computer codes, used by different member states, and the enhancement of their predictive capacities. Well checked results of accident simulation experiments and their analyses with advanced fuel performance codes were carried out in the CRP and the results published in an IAEA technical document in 2019.",
            "The second CRP on “Analysis of Options and Experimental Examination of Fuels with Increased Accident Tolerance (ACTOF)” (2015-2019) dealt with the acquisition of data through experiments on advanced technology fuel types and cladding materials. It also looked at development of modelling capacity to predict the behaviour of the components and the integral performance of ATF designs under normal and transient conditions and sought to demonstrate improvements under severe accident conditions. These results were published in an IAEA technical document in 2020.",
            "Based on recommendation of an IAEA Technical Meeting (TM) on Modelling of Fuel Behaviour in Design Basis Accidents and Design Extension Conditions in May 2019, a new CRP on Testing and Simulations of ATF was launched in 2021 and is ongoing. It includes a set of experiments with some participants providing samples to several laboratories. The experiments then provide data on a new set of ATFs. The results will be available in 2024.",
            "This CRP aims to address factors affecting the design, fabrication and in-pile behaviour of currently operating and innovative nuclear fuels and materials for power reactors, and to increase technology readiness. Objectives include:",
            "To perform experimental tests including single rod and bundle tests on ATFs’ performance under normal, Design Basis (DB) and Design Extension (DE) conditions",

            "Dr Nicolas Waeckel a former employee of Electricité de France (EDF) who worked for many years on ATF development told NEI: “We started to work on ATF together with US DOE right after Fukushima, participating in expert groups in IAEA and OECD.” He added: “I was in charge of developing a new safety standard to qualify this new type of fuel. When you develop a new type of fuel you cannot apply current standards. You have to develop new criteria, a new way of validating the material… and maybe even changing the way of thinking about safety for a type of fuel which can be very different from current fuel.”",
            "Since 2012, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has supported the development of ATF concepts through its Enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (EATF) programme. DOE is currently funding research by France’s Framatome as well as GE Hitachi and Westinghouse. Russia is also currently testing its TVS-2M ATF at unit 2 of the Rostov nuclear plant.",
            "Waeckel pointed out that the DOE had received funding from Congress to develop safer fuel “so all the fuel manufacturers and the researchers worked quite hard on development”. As a result, even before Fukushima, many laboratories and manufacturers “had on their shelves in the closet some exotic fuel under development, but on standby,” he said. “However, there was no demand, no real need to put this fuel in a reactor because the current fuel was behaving quite well.”",
            "He added: “People who developed the nuclear industry 15 years ago were pretty good, and they learned a lot from their mistakes and some bad experiences so that now we have achieved very good optimisation.” That, argues Waeckel, is why the fuel concept did not change. “And now, all of a sudden, because of Fukushima, just because DOE had the great idea of saving the world, we are considering change. I think we have to be a bit more humble.”",
            "He said the driver to develop ATF used to be enhanced performance and behaviour in accidents, “but we realised that this is not really achievable in the short term”. So now the focus is on other things – cladding, fuel cycle optimisation – a longer cycle and higher burn up. “This may be of some interest to the operators… improving plant economics – that is the motor,” said Waeckel.",
            "Among the multiple variants of ATF proposed by the various fuel suppliers (see Figure 1), there are two main categories of fuel, with respect to their technology readiness level, which relates to the time and effort needed to develop, qualify, and license the concepts. These are:",
            "Short-term evolutionary concepts, for example coated Zr-based claddings; stainless steel cladding (eg FeCrAl); high density fuel (eg U3Si2), and doped fuel pellets (eg Cr doped)",
            "Longer-term revolutionary concepts, such as refractory claddings (eg lined Mo), silicon carbide (SiC) claddings; microcells fuel; micro-encapsulated fuel pellet concepts; uranium nitride fuel",
            "Key requirements for advanced fuels relate to in-reactor fuel performance, cladding performance, and compatibility with all system constraints.",
            "Waeckel stressed that developing a new type of fuel is a long-term objective in terms of its qualification. “Putting new fuel in a reactor is not like putting a new app on your telephone. If the app doesn’t work you just dump it and the phone is still safe. But if you put the wrong fuel in a reactor it could be a nightmare for everyone. So, we have to be very prudent, very careful, think about everything that could happen. No operator in the world wants to experience bad surprises.”",
            "However, this caution is not necessarily a negative thing. “For me, all this is very positive because it is motivating all the labs, all the researchers, and especially the young generation,” he said. “They see a vision for the future in developing this new type of fuel.” Some projects are very exotic and totally different from standard fuel while others are very similar – just fuel with a novel coating. Some of these evolutionary fuels are already under irradiation as part of the testing and qualification process.",
            "However, Waeckel cautioned the ultimate progress for these evolutionary fuels is limited. “What we are talking about is grace time – we are going to gain a couple of minutes. It is not a game changer. It is a small change and offers some benefit. Is it real accident tolerant fuel? Not really, but it is an improvement,” he said.",
            "Concluding, Waeckel said: “My main message is that development is always positive for the nuclear community because we are making progress in all areas – in research, in investigation techniques, in measurement techniques, in modelling, and all these improvements are beneficial for the nuclear industry as a whole,” he said, observing: “So even if the product itself is not going to be a magic answer or a magic solution, it is a platform for the young generation to think about safety, modelling, advanced modelling, advanced investigation.”",

        "text": [
            "Above: OPG is to construct a first-of-a-kind GE Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Darlington nuclear site (Photo credit: Ontario Power Generation (OPG))",
            "The latest in the long series of nuclear technology promises, that of the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), keeps gaining potency, as illustrated by the evolution of the discourses between the 2022 and 2023 Reuters SMR and Advanced Reactor conferences. The nuclear community has been highly successful in creating a sense of urgency, in the face of climate and energy security crises, thereby lending the promise considerable legitimacy. By contrast, the road is long before the SMR promise reaches sufficient credibility – a second key success factor for any techno-scientific promise – by persuading investors and other stakeholders of the industry’s ability to deliver.",
            "The promise is facing an increasingly risky phase, as shown by the recent cancellation of the NuScale project in Idaho. The greater the expectations, the deeper is the disappointment if the hopeful discourses fail to gradually translate into policy instruments, funding schemes – and ultimately, R&D, prototype and commercial projects. Yet, the credibility and the very success of the SMR promise may matter less for a growing number of industry players and nuclear advocates who see SMRs less as an end and more as a means of getting back to the “real business” of building large reactors.",
            "Is the SMR promise legitimate?",
            "The urgency of tackling the climate change and energy security challenges has lent the SMRs the legitimacy, and hence the political support, that is vital for any techno-scientific promise. If 2022’s Atlanta conference was replete with frustration and nostalgic references to the foregone times of political leadership under the Atoms for Peace programme, last year’s motto seemed to be that the nuclear community has now won the political battle – and that “there’s no path to net zero without nuclear”. Fred Dermarkar, the President and CEO of Canada’s nuclear science and technology laboratory AECL, opened his speech with great enthusiasm: “It’s a heart-stopping historic moment!… For how long have we been asking for leadership?…Well, we have it now!” The prominent role of nuclear in the recent joint statement by PM Trudeau and President Biden on energy-sector collaboration served as a sign of political leadership. Alongside the frequent references to IEA and IPPC reports, in 2023 the speakers evoked the recent Ontario grid operator’s report, which suggests that to reach its net-zero emission target by 2050, the province could need up to 17,800 MW of new nuclear capacity, both SMRs and large reactors. Reaching the climate targets without stable nuclear baseload might be possible but extremely costly, the Atlanta speakers reasoned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the downsides of stable and rather inflexible baseload in the decentralised and renewables-dominated grids of tomorrow were not explored.",
            "Legitimacy alone is not enough, however, if the promise-makers fail to convince key stakeholders of the ability of the technology to effectively tackle the problem. The concern of the industry’s ability to deliver was even more acute in 2023 than the year before. Where to find the requisite resources and abilities to complete the SMR designs, persuade investors, rebuild supply chains, pass through the regulatory maze, and then eventually construct new reactors at the pace needed to satisfy the demand, and – according to a pledge by a group of over 20 countries at COP 28 – triple the global nuclear capacity by 2050?",
            "Historical experience of the radical downscaling of electricity growth forecasts in the mid-1970s calls for caution. Yet, if demand does indeed shootsthrough the roof, how is the SMR industry to compete with its rivals, for the needed resources, for both highly skilled and unskilled workforce?",
            "The industry question of “can we deliver?” had by 2023 surpassed the concerns for cumbersome safety regulation as an obstacle to SMR deployment. Gone were the previous year’s complaints about “too much democracy” in safety regulation, instead the regulators and government speakers now openly challenged the industry. Ramzi Jammal, Chief Regulatory Operations Officer at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), pointed out that international regulatory harmonisation was well underway, including plans to set up an International Technical Support Organization (ITSO) to assist regulators in embarking countries. Jammal had a scathing message to the industry: “You are behind us, let me tell you bluntly… Get your act together, standardise the codes and move on in that direction. Otherwise, you are going to get something you are not going to like!”. Björn Peters, the co-founder of Dual Fluid, developing a lead-cooled SMR, echoed Jammal: once the industry comes up with a truly good design, “licensing will follow, politics will follow”, but the real challenge is to “convince… in each utility the top 20 people or so to buy a few” reactors.",
            "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Julie Kozeracki made an almost desperate plea for action: “At LPO (DOE’s Loan Programs Office), I have 300 billion dollars in loans that almost nobody wants, for nuclear deployment.” With a pinch of sarcasm, Kozeracki noted that “the nuclear industry really loves press releases, they love MoUs, they love letters of intent. But I can’t finance a supply chain or build a workforce on a press release. I need signed contracts!”",
            "The SMR promise is still far from proving its credibility in the eyes of investors. Symptomatic was that Westinghouse, with its AP300, had replaced NuScale as the 2023 conference’s opening showcase. NuScale’s recent troubles – the steady decline of its share price since August 2022, the cancellation in November 2023 of its planned first-of-a-kind project in Idaho, for the lack of subscribers – illustrate the fragility of the promise of new, even light-water, reactor designs. The absence of Rolls-Royce, another posterchild from the 2022 conference, points in the same direction.",
            "But why should investors believe that this time all will be different, that the industry has learned its lessons and that SMR projects will not run vastly over time and over budget, like the recent AP1000s in the US and EPRs in Europe? By educating the finance community, answered Kalev Kallemets, director of the Estonian SMR start-up Fermi Energia. “The public has moved on, but the financing has not… in nuclear, we are living in the post-traumas. It’s important to bring that very conservative field of finance also to the 21st century.” However, the recipe based on the “deficit model” – that citizens must be educated, and thus liberated from their “irrational fears” – has not worked with the general public and is unlike to work with the finance community. A more serious initiative is the plan to establish an International Bank for Nuclear Investment (IBNI), presented in Atlanta by its chairman Daniel Dean as a “long-term partner and pro-industry, pro-market and pro-investor supporter and enabler of SMR/Gen IV stakeholders”. Crucially, IBNI would establish “a globally recognised and harmonised” set of standards and criteria for SMR technologies, thereby seeking to help scale-up and commodify SMR delivery across the world.",
            "Consultants and pro-nuclear climate activists Kirsty Gogan and Eric Ingersoll, from Terra Praxis, painted even bolder visions of scaling up via “productisation”. Their vision of a move away from cumbersome, risky, and difficult-to-finance one-off projects towards modular factory production is elemental to the SMR promise. Turning the vision into practice may be difficult. Even SMR advocates have shown scepticism towards the idea of modularity as factory production. Many prominent nuclear-sector cheerleaders on social media are equally critical.",
            "Exploiting the window of opportunity",
            "Being able to deliver is fundamental, yet the Atlanta 2023 speakers stressed that doing it fast is vital. “We must build reactors now!”, said Fred Dermarkar from the AECL, “to show that we can deliver”, not least to enable the nuclear industry to stay in the game. The creation of IBNI may help, but even there, timelines are becoming stretched, with plans to have the Bank operational by 2026. Views diverge on what the current “window of opportunity” for SMRs in fact consists of. For some, it is the growing public acceptance, spurred by climate change and energy security concerns, and the fading of the memories of the Fukushima disaster. For others, the opportunity lies in the unprecedented yet ever so fragile political demand and leadership. Many nuclear critics argue that the development of battery technologies, grid management and demand-side solutions will soon close the “window” and render SMRs uncompetitive with renewables. In contrast, and echoing the general sentiment in Atlanta, Julie Kozeracki argued that nuclear does not even need to compete with renewables but instead with “other clean, firm options” such as “solar with really long-duration storage, or natural gas with carbon capture, geothermal, or hydropower”.",
            "Instead of safety regulation, the lengthy siting procedures and impact assessments were at the 2023 conference highlighted as a major obstacle to fast delivery of SMRs. Great hopes were placed on repurposing former coal or decommissioned nuclear sites, which could help cut down the planning, assessment and site preparation time down to 4-5 years from the current 8-9 years. However, Scott Hunnewell, Vice President of the New Nuclear Program at the TVA, reminded delegates of the difficulties of repurposing, including the highly distinct requirements and conditions for coal and nuclear sites. Public acceptance cannot be taken for granted either, even in communities with populations desperate for new economic activity and familiar with risky industries.",
            "The question haunting the 2022 conference was that of leadership: who is to move first and commit to an SMR project? A year later, Canada, with supply chains in shape – largely thanks to the recent and ongoing refurbishments – had consolidated its role as a potential leader of yet another promised nuclear renaissance in the West. “The world is looking to Canada!,” exclaimed Brian Fehrenbach, Director of Business Development at the Organisation Canadian Nuclear Industries (OCNI). More accurate might be to say that all eyes are on Ontario, where OPG is to construct a first-of-a-kind GE Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Darlington nuclear site, with the expected completion date of 2028. The announced timetable has not slipped, yet. Empirical evidence on costs and feasibility, based on this project, were to precede any commitment to a wider SMR programme, yet in July 2023, the Ontario provincial government jumped the gun, by confirming OPG’s plan to build three additional BWRX-300s on the same site. SaskPower is eagerly waiting for cost experience from the OPG, to decide in 2029 whether to follow suit and launch the construction of four BWRX-300s.",
            "Most of the leading SMR designs may be foreign, especially American, but the Canadian government’s commitment to nuclear is arguably stronger than ever.",
            "The policy frameworks and collaborative networks (SMR Roadmap, Action Plan, strategic plan, and feasibility study) are there, laying the basis for the three “streams” of SMR development – light-water SMRs for grid electricity, advanced designs mainly for industrial heat and power, and micro-SMRs for off-grid uses in remote communities.",
            "But have the Canadians learned from past policy failures? Has the country left behind its policy tradition that political scientists Michael Howlett and Andrea Migone have characterised as one of “overpromising and underdelivering”? Are the supportive discourse, creation of networks, and relatively modest financial support simply just another way of “kicking the can down the road” rather than a determined strategy? Sceptics predict a similar fate for SMRs as that which befell the nearly mythical Arrow aircraft carrier, supposed to consolidate Canadian technological leadership in the 1950s. The then Prime Minister Diefenbaker abruptly stopped the vast technology programme in 1959, arguing that rapid changes in geopolitics and technology had made Arrow obsolete. According to rumours, pressure from Americans unwilling to face competition from their northern neighbour was a vital contributing factor. The SMR promise will end like the Arrow did, critics argue: the Americans will, in the end, snatch the markets and put the Canadians back to their place.",
            "SMRs: A stepping stone back to megaprojects?",
            "For many in the nuclear community, the SMR promise appears increasingly as an instrument, a stepping stone on the way back to constructing large reactors, rather than an end in and of itself. Last year in Atlanta an entire session, chaired by OCNI’s Fehrenbach, explored the relationships between SMRs and large nuclear reactors. While the legitimacy of the SMR promise has thus far largely relied on the notion that nuclear megaprojects are just too risky, costly, and slow, SMRs are now often portrayed as a useful, if not indispensable, bridge towards large reactor projects. As presumably safer, cheaper, and multifunctional, SMRs could help to overcome the public opposition and scepticism that has handicapped large nuclear projects, so the arguement goes. Moreover, the SMR promise helps to keep nuclear in the headlines, attract talent, and retain the skills and competences needed for the construction of large reactors – a line of reasoning particularly valid in Canada, with its home-grown CANDU knowhow and well-established nuclear institutions. Finally, enthusiasm for SMRs is partly motivated by defence interests, as highlighted by policymakers and nuclear-sector insiders.",
            "Beyond the value of the SMRs as a “stepping stone”, the rather vague overall SMR promise serves various constituencies, regardless of the actual success of any specific design. By declaring their support and providing funding for R&D into SMRs, politicians can show they are acting upon the climate and energy security challenges; the R&D community benefits from new challenges and funding opportunities; and investors can make a quick buck by speculating on the stocks of SMR companies. Vendor start-ups may be among the few for whom the success of their chosen SMR design is decisive. The instrumental value of SMRs might help explain the contradiction between the rather pessimistic evaluations of the potential economic viability of SMRs on the one hand, and the growing enthusiasm towards these technologies in the policy world on the other. What counts may not be the viability of the technology itself but instead the value that the promise itself can provide, in various ways, to the diverse involved communities.",

        "title": "NEA launches second edition of its Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",
            "Much greater technological detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. The 424 pages provide data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. However, this depends largely on information from the designers. Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines."

TerraPower said, when completed, the Natrium plant will be a full commercial operating. The other four suppliers are GERB Vibration Control Systems, Thermal Engineering International, Hayward Tyler and Teledyne Brown Engineering.",

        "text": [
            "Above: While relatively small features within the context of an overall build, valves are critical for keeping certain SMR designs functioning within ideal parameters",
            "Nuclear power no longer has an image problem. The negative sentiment that has driven its decline since the 1990s is changing and many states, according to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, are now looking to introduce or expand capacity.",
            "In 1996, nuclear accounted for 17% of global energy production. Today, that figure is around 10%, but the direction of travel is clear. More than 50 reactors are under construction worldwide, mostly in China and India, while other countries have reversed planned nuclear phase-outs. Japan, for instance, is bringing nine reactors back online, with 30 due to restart by 2030.",
            "These changes reflect a period of instability. Energy access and security of supply have become major concerns, with some nations having to rethink medium- to long-term strategy. This is a problem because stability is necessary to limit disruption as economies transition from fossil fuels to low or zero-carbon energy sources, not least those that introduce their own degree of intermittency, such as wind and solar.",
            "Given this situation, it’s unsurprising to see attention returning to nuclear as the intermediary. It’s safe, ‘pilotable’, cost-effective when deployed correctly and, most importantly, zero-carbon. Granted, there is a certain irony in returning to a technology pioneered in the last century when many seem fixed on ‘future’ means of power production. However, the benefits offered by Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) – the industry’s most promising concept – are compelling.",
            "Reduced capital costs, grid balancing, and deep carbon reductions are just some of the prizes SMRs offer. This stimulates huge demand and an influx of investment from governments, investors and R&D departments from some of the industry’s most recognisable names. There are also a large number of new entries to the market backed by VCs and consortia, reflecting the transformative power – and considerable profit potential – of a full commercial-scale design.",
            "Reaching this point, however, will be difficult without a series of changes. These changes include a revision to the regulatory landscape but also closer collaboration with manufacturers that have existing knowledge of nuclear engineering and critical service in general.",
            "Getting to grips with standardisation",
            "SMRs are significant because they’re based on proven science. They also tie in with the idea that the vast majority of technologies required to achieve net zero emissions already exist, albeit in varying degrees of maturity.",
            "Maturity is arguably the most obvious problem with today’s SMR market. There are currently over 80 designs at varying stages of completion, using different coolants and reactor types. This level of activity is undeniably positive, though it also hints at a lack of standardisation that will be essential for making SMRs financially viable.",
            "An attractive business model is important for SMRs and the nuclear industry more generally – especially as the ‘all-in’ cost of renewable energy continues to fall. While interest is currently high, it’s not unreasonable to imagine investors moving away from SMRs if they begin to fall foul of the same delays and budget overruns seen at large reactor sites such as Vogtle in the USA, Flamanville 3 in France, and Hinkley Point in the UK.",
            "But standardisation is not just an issue for those in charge of the balance sheet. It also cuts to the very reason why SMRs were proposed in the first place: convenience and reach. Modular reactors allow nuclear power to reach areas that are unfavourable for traditional multiple-hundreds of MW plants. There’s even potential for them to offer ad-hoc power for relatively short periods, deployed as part of an emergency response or in support of regional economic development. These opportunities are impractical, if not impossible, without a safe and reliable design that benefits from economies of scale.",
            "While not standardised in the strictest sense, there are signs of real progress. GE Hitachi, for example, has made inroads with its BWRX-300, a 300 MW water-cooled reactor design based on its ESBWR design, the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor. The ESBWR is already licensed by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, using the same equipment and fuel used in other GE Hitachi reactors currently in service across the world. Several engineering changes have taken place, including the reduction of safety relief valves and an increase in the design pressure. If approved, GE Hitachi’s SMR could be grid-connected sometime before the end of the decade. This would be ahead of most estimated timelines for SMRs being developed by established players, which typically lie somewhere in the mid-2030s.",
            "It’s Rolls Royce, however, that offers the best example of why it’s important to keep commercial realities in sight during SMR development. The company is currently engaged in a partly UK government-funded programme to develop 470 MWe pressurised water units. The initial £500m (US$634m) of programme funding is due to run out before the end of 2024, which has caused Rolls Royce’s CEO to publicly request the drafting of a government deployment plan before the end of 2023. These SMRs are projected to cost around £1.8bn (US$2.3bn) – a huge saving when compared to the £9bn (US$11.4bn) that could be needed for one unit of Sizewell C. Whether that cost is achievable remains unclear until its Generic Design Assessment is completed.",
            "The Promise of harmonised regulation",
            "It’s difficult to overlook the regulatory maze surrounding SMRs and how this affects roll-out. Licences are needed for both design and operation. This applies to both the vendor where an SMR is being developed and to the end user. In most cases, these two parties will be in separate countries with different regulatory stipulations.",
            "Given the number of proposed SMR designs in development, progression through licensing has become a slow and intimidating process. Regulators are unfamiliar with many SMR designs, especially those relying on innovative reactors and novel manufacturing methods.",
            "Some of the more mature SMRs use established coolants, such as pressurised water, whereas others rely on relatively newer approaches using liquid metal, helium, and molten salts. Any deviation or change from what is already known or approved will need thorough testing evidence to guarantee safety.",
            "This is understandable and should not be regarded as an obstacle to commercial success. After all, public confidence will be a requisite as local authorities bring nuclear power much closer to the places where people live and work. SMRs benefit from smaller reactor cores and, therefore, smaller radioactive inventories that, in theory, reduce shielding requirements and the size of emergency planning zones. Some also include an integral steam supply system in which the steam generator is directly connected to the reactor. These built-in passive safety systems provide SMRs with greater and, in some cases, indefinite coping times in the event of an offsite power failure.",
            "Still, the industry recognises the complexities of cross-border regulation. In 2022, for example, the IAEA announced a Nuclear Harmonisation and Standardisation Initiative, which aims to simplify the process that would see SMRs readied for deployment worldwide. This also includes a framework for accepting factory-assembled parts that, once passed, would create a global production network based on a set of agreed manufacturing principles shared by the regulatory bodies of each participating nation. The idea would follow something similar to the regulatory landscape that is now established best practice in global shipping and aviation.",
            "This would be a significant step forward, allowing a large number of parts to be licensed for production in multiple countries, creating the type of coordinated supply chain necessary to drive down costs. However, this solution also introduces its own set of challenges. Modular construction and fabricated parts built according to consistent codes and standards will require legal scrutiny, especially when it comes to logistics. For example, international nuclear liability regimes for transportable plants are still unclear, as is the applicability of environmental protection and public participation legislation.",
            "The role of critical service",
            "Given the long regulatory approvals process – even for businesses that are further ahead with their design – opting for what’s known to meet existing standards is clearly sensible. Not just to prove the overall SMR concept, but also to give economies a pragmatic way to complement the variable nature of renewables without creating a major shortfall.",
            "Valves offer a good case in point. While relatively small features within the context of an overall build, they are critical for keeping certain SMR designs functioning within ideal parameters. IMI Critical Engineering is helping to accelerate progress in this area by assisting with the application and design of several core components, including all safety relief valve types. This includes main steam safety valves, main steam and main feed-water isolation valves, turbine bypass valves, and also emergency core cooling system strainers.",
            "All these products have been previously approved for service in large-scale reactors. While they cannot be applied like-for-like in an SMR, they nevertheless have thousands of hours of operations proven in critical service, easing some of the unfamiliarity regulators will face with bespoke engineered parts. This is particularly important given the passive safety systems inherent to many SMR designs, which lower the barrier of entry for new, inexperienced operators.",
            "This is not to say components can be overlooked or fast-tracked during development. Every part, irrespective of where it’s manufactured, must go through the same robust testing procedure that has underpinned decades of safe product design and engineering in nuclear. But, if simplicity and speed are necessary aspects of making SMRs a success, then it’s prudent for developers to work with existing components and companies with knowledge of how they perform in critical service. This is just one aspect of a much larger puzzle, though no less important for introducing a technology that can legitimately decarbonise the grid and wider industry at a meaningful pace.",

        "text": [
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW). Sheffield Forgemasters Research, Design & Technology Director Jesus Talamantes-Silva said the company had achieved “a significant milestone in assembling a nuclear vessel demonstrator, using electron beam welding for the first time at this scale, with 100% success and no defects”.",
            "Completing four, thick, nuclear-grade welds took less than 24 hours – work which typically requires a year. \"With a diameter of three metres and a wall thickness of 200mm, construction of the vessel showcases the reliability and capabilities of LEBW, setting a dramatic new standard for weld-joining thick-walled components, previously untrialled in a demonstrator model,\" the company noted.",
            "The operation deployed specially developed parameters, meticulously fine-tuned during the welding development stage, including innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld, ensuring a clean and complete weld-join.",
            "Senior development engineer and project lead Michael Blackmore believes the implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental, potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation. \"Not only does this reduce the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material, but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the UK and beyond, that's how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters said demonstrating LEBW technology's potential opens new horizons for \"more efficient, low-cost and less time-heavy nuclear assemblies\" with far-reaching implications for other projects which require thick-walled welded assemblies.",
            "Jacob Pope, development engineer and LEBW machine tool installation lead said: “We thank the government's Department for Energy Security & Net Zero for enabling the project through its Nuclear Innovation Programme. We also thank our esteemed partner, Cambridge Vacuum Engineering, for their invaluable support throughout this endeavour. Their remote and on-site assistance played an instrumental role in the success of this milestone, highlighting the collaborative spirit that drives us forward.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters, which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, is the only UK company able to manufacture the large forgings required for SMRs. The company said future activities include a joint industrial project “supported by key participants from the USA and UK”. The aim is “to initiate a code case or multiple cases to facilitate the deployment of this technology in accordance with the standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)”.",
            "In December, the company said it was on track to regain ASME status as a supplier of heavy forgings and castings to the civil nuclear market. An ASME Section III Division I NCA 3300, NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, has recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations. This would allow it supply castings and forgings (material) for civil nuclear applications and also be qualified to carry out weld construction activities on these materials.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK. Under the MOU, X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK.",
            "Earlier, in February 2023, the company signed an MOU with with Holtec Britain to design components for Holtec’s SMR-160 SMR and identify the best routes to manufacture. This followed similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, SFI and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 SFI signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK.",

            "Holtec’s design is also aimed at hard-to-reach process industries. (Credit: Holtec International)",
            "Advanced nuclear technologies could form an integral part of the solution to reconcile the need for clean energy with energy security; this is the conclusion of a new report from Charles River Associates (CRA). The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.",
            "CRA’s report, titled: ‘Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival’ further says: “The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.”",
            "Addressing investment challenges",
            "The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.",
            "Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale’s Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: “The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren’t what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you’re grounded in the best technological positions.”",
            "Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: “In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.”",
            "that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: “The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren’t yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.”",
            "Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: “There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they’re undertaking.”",
            "However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. “The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it’s very much hinged on policy sentiment.” Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: “The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.",
            "Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. “Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.”",
            "Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.",
            "Kotak adds: “It’s exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they’re working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.”",
            "Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.",
            "The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: “Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they’re all being predicated on the fact that they’re trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that’s a positive.",
            "A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.",
            "Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.",
            "The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.",
            "“There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There’s a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,” she says.",
            "The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.",
            "Canada’s introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a ‘fundamental and necessary component’ of the low-carbon energy system.",
            "In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada’s federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.",
            "As Kotak says: “Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It’s only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.”",
            "The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project.",
            "Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH’s BWRX-300 SMR for the project.",
            "Kotak picks up on these developments: “It’s great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.”",
            "The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a ‘Nuclear Alliance’ consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe’s energy goals.",
            "In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament’s recent approval of the Government’s nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France’s ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country’s electricity mix.",
            "The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH’s BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.",
            "Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.",
            "“We’re seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates’ TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,” says Kotak.",
            "Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: “Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market.” She adds: “The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources – nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal – need to be considered.”",
            "The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.",
            "“From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn’t taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,” says Kotak.",
            "Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: “Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals.” As Kotak concludes: “As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we’ve seen with other energy sources.”"

            "With around 80 designs of small modular and advanced reactors on the drawing board there is clearly an abundance of creativity across the nuclear industry. That could spark a new nuclear era, bringing all the benefits of low-carbon, energy dense and dispatchable resource to diverse new markets and applications. Some of the SMR designs that are being proposed are generational types of existing power station reactors. However, a lot of the designs are newer technologies, for example molten salt reactor technology or heat pipe reactors. The problem is that for these newer technologies and the types of fuels that are going to be used in them, the regulatory framework is simply not in place.",
            "Simon Chaplin, transport specialist at the World Nuclear Transport Institute (WNTI) outlines some of the issues: “If you’re transporting the fuel for some of the reactors being proposed, this is high assay, low enriched uranium [HALEU]. That’s higher than the enrichment for which the majority of packaging has been designed for, so the regulatory authorities will be need to look at new packaging and then developing the regulations that surround that.”",
            "Another area of regulatory concern is transportation not just of fuel, but of fully fuelled turn-key reactors. “We may have SMRs where they’re transported without fuel involved, which won’t be difficult because there’s no nuclear element to it. It’s just something which is transported, constructed, and then the fuel will be taken to the site where it’s used. This approach would be operated in the same way that they do now with conventional large-scale nuclear power stations.”",
            "He cites the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant. ”That’s classed as an SMR but really that’s using established technology in that it’s based on PWRs so it’s technology that’s been around for a number of years,” says Chaplin. However, he adds: “Some SMRs will be constructed in a yard or a factory where the fuel will be loaded at the same time that it’s constructed or shortly after, maybe in that location or in a secondary location. At that point it will need to be transported with fuel which may be HALEU fuel or maybe more conventional fuel but the challenge we will have is that at the moment, if you’re transporting, say, new fuel to go in a power station there are specific types of packaging. If you now have fuel inside the reactor, then are regulatory issues associated with classifying the reactor as a fuel package or as a reactor in operation?”",
            "This is a more complex issue than it may at first appear, as Chaplin explains: “If it’s classified as a reactor in operation, you could look at using the same rules that are in place for, say, the maritime estate for a nuclear-powered ship. In this case the reactor is considered to be just a part of the ship. However, if it’s a module that’s being transported in a turnkey state with fuel on board, it would be cargo. Under those circumstances there are separate rules to consider it as cargo rather than part of a vessel or conveyance but also whether it is classified as a package.”",
            "If it is considered a package then the actual reactor that’s being carried would have to be able to withstand the same sort of conditions that a package would have to, for example a drop test, an immersion test, a stacking test, and a fire test. “All of those conditions would have to be applied to the reactor and that may not be something that’s easy to achieve. That is an immediate challenge to understand how we’re going to do that and how the various regulatory frameworks would apply,” notes Chaplin.",
            "Designing reactors for lifecycle transport",
            "One of the other associated with transportation and that must be established prior to deployment are the rules and regulations concerning the way that SMRs are potentially operated.",
            "Conventional nuclear power stations are generally operated by an entity that regulatory or government authorities usually have quite close control over concerning the operations of a plant. They are also typically large sites that feature lots of physical security with fences and security guards and they’re generally close to a populated area where people can relatively easily respond to emergencies or security incidents that may arise. For an SMR it could be that none of these conditions may apply.",
            "“With an SMR potentially they may be located in a very remote area and there’s also the potential that they may even be operating automatically and therefore maybe unmanned. The operators will have to make sure that things like safety, security and safeguards would need to be considered in the actual design stages. Just as safety by design is already a consideration so there will be security by design and safeguards by design as well,” says Chaplin, who adds: “Designers will need to consider where it is and how it’s going to be operated to make sure that there is sufficient safety, security and safeguards. That will also apply to the transport phases of the operation too, during transport to the site of operation, during operation and then during the decommissioning.”",
            "Indeed, decommissioning is potentially another particular challenge for SMRs. Chaplin expands on this theme: “Within the design of all of the SMRs that are proposed, the decommissioning process must be considered as well. It may not be possible to decommission in the same way as a conventional site where decommissioning is done in situ and components are taken apart. Instead, they may have to consider an SMR with a spent fuel inside it which will need to be transported to another site for decommissioning.”",
            "While it is clear that designers will need to make sure that all SMRs will be suitable for the operations necessary for the entire life cycle, not all are giving sufficient prominence to the transport issue. As Chaplin observes: “Within the WNTI membership we’ve got several companies that have been designing SMRs and transport is something that they definitely think about, whereas others sometimes indicate that transportation is an issue to be considered at some later date. That’s quite remiss because if you can’t transport it, you’re not going to be able to operate it either. In terms of potential barriers to SMR deployment that’s a deal breaker. If you can’t move the fuel or you can’t move the reactor to the site or take it away again, that’s it. It’s dead in the water”.",
            "Establishing regulatory frameworks",
            "In considering SMRs there are potentially two different types that require considerably different approaches. Some designs are delivered as a complete unit or modules that get assembled in a location and which will stay in that location for the entirety of the unit’s operational life. There are also potentially designs which will be very mobile and which feature an easily transportable containerised reactor, possibly with some other containers which would carry the balance of plant. They may be used for disaster relief, for example, as they can be taken to a location, operated for a number of weeks or months and then taken somewhere else. The fact that a reactor could be moved has some profound implications for the regulatory regime.",
            "Chaplin explains: “At the moment the countries that are talking about using SMRs are countries which already have a developed or even an early-stage nuclear industry or a nuclear regulator. However, there are a lot of countries which will be using SMRs which don’t have a nuclear regulator. They may well not have had any reason to develop a nuclear regulatory framework. Inevitably the host nation would need to have some sort of oversight and some way to intervene if necessary but if they haven’t got a developed nuclear regulator, they won’t have the skills to do that. That is a lot to do.”",
            "In that situation, the host nation are perhaps not going to want to have to develop the necessary regulatory bodies or take too much responsibility for oversight of a plant. In which case it’s more likely that the regulatory side will just focus on making sure that operations are being conducted safely while the operator will be responsible for all of the running, maintenance, staffing and also taking the reactors away at the end of the project. However, where those responsibilities lie will need to established in advance, as Chaplin says: “I think another thing which really needs to be considered by the designers and operators long before deployment is to actually work out who will be responsible for what. That is not so difficult with, say, a land-based SMR but for a floating one that could be more challenging. It will need to determined whether responsibility rests with the country that supplied it and is operating it, if they’re going to be responsible for things like safety, security and safeguards, for example, or whether it would be the host state that would be responsible for those. We don’t really know the answer as to how that will work yet.”",
            "These regulatory issues may also have far-reaching implications for market development too. For some SMR designs, from a regulatory stance and an operations perspective, they are not really any different to the large-scale plants that are already in operation or being developed. “For these kinds of designs the actual modules will be transported without any fuel involved so they are just pieces of equipment that will be constructed and operated in the same way as a large-scale PWR. Designs from Westinghouse, Rolls-Royce, and GE Hitachi are essentially smaller versions of conventional designs and so are potentially going to avoid a lot of these transport and regulatory issues because it’s already been done for their bigger cousins. They might actually get ahead of advanced designs just because they already have, for example, transport package approval and all the associated validation and testing,” notes Chaplin.",
            "Progress on regulatory frameworks",
            "Although many issues remain outstanding to develop the right regulatory frameworks that will be appropriate for all the various SMR designs, progress is clearly being made. Chaplin explains: “Within the international Atomic Energy Agency they are beginning to look at all the regulatory environments. Similarly, in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), because there are similar issues but also additional ones with transporting a nuclear power plant at sea, there aren’t really the rules in place for doing that.”",
            "WNTI have been invited by the IAEA to participate in working groups for transportable nuclear power plants, for example while another working group is being established specifically for floating nuclear power plants to help guide member states as they develop the regulations.",
            "“They do see the importance of industry being involved in these discussions and not just safety, security and safeguards. They realise that they can’t just have the member states sit around the table and start coming up with what’s good, they need to have industry input just so that they can be certain the regulations and the recommendations that they come up with actually work,” says Chaplin.",
            "Considering the IMO rules, fundamental changes will be needed to accommodate SMRs. “At the moment, it looks like one potential solution is to revise the rules within the safety of life at sea convention and specifically chapter eight, which is the code of safety for nuclear-powered merchant ships. That could be revised to encompass floating nuclear power stations as well. A floating nuclear power station has got to be towed somewhere by sea so there will be maritime regulations that will apply to it. At the moment, that regulation was drafted in the 1960s and was released in 1981. It’s hopelessly out of date given it was written at a time when they were only concerned with nuclear-powered merchant vessels which never really took off other than in the Russian Federation and formerly the Soviet Union,” says Chaplin.",
            "Indeed, WNTI is currently conducting an analysis to explore what changes would be needed to those regulations to bring them up to date so that they can encompass not just nuclear-powered vessels, but also floating nuclear power plants and more specifically those that use new technologies like molten salt reactors alongside the more conventional pressurized water reactors. Aside from floating reactors, the shipping of reactors that are designed for terrestrial applications would potentially fall within those same rules or may come under one of the other regulations that cover cargo. Similarly, carrying a fuelled reactor as cargo might come under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG) or the Irradiated Nuclear Fuels (INF) code, which are the regulations that apply when transporting irradiated fuel plutonium and high-level waste at sea. Those regulations could be expanded to encompass reactors with fuel on board, whether it be for deployment or under the circumstances where it’s being returned with spent fuel on board. Nonetheless, this is a work in progress, as Chapin notes: “At the moment, it’s not been done and no one has shipped a reactor with fuel in it as a cargo. The only time they have been moved at sea they are part of the conveyance so that will be completely new. None of this is actually in place, and the same applies to the packaging and all the other elements that will need to be in place.”",
            "He notes that additional investment is needed in R&D so that drop tests can be conducted on the flasks and process like that will be ramped up as part of this drive to get SMRs built, shipped and deployed.",
            "Chaplin continues: “For molten salt reactors reactors, heat pipe technology or those that will use HALEU fuel, for example, we need to get regulations in place and that can be a frustrating and very slow process where consensus is needed.” However, overall Chaplin is optimistic. He concludes: “SMRs are such a broad and diverse church, but they are coming at a great pace and we are a lot further along than I thought we would have been in just five years. It feels like it’s a monumental task but, like a snowball rolling downhill, it seems to be gathering pace. As more people understand the need for this and also the challenges, I think the faster it will be. There has been talk of deployment of some SMRs using molten salt reactors in the early 2030s. I wouldn’t like to say it’s not going to happen. I think that it’s easily achievable as long as momentum stays there.”"

            "The final report pf Estonia’s Working Group on Nuclear Energy has concluded that the introduction of nuclear energy would support the achievement of climate objectives, security of supply and stability of the energy system.",
            "Over the past two and a half years the National Nuclear Energy Working Group analysed the potential of small modular reactors (SMRs) in line with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Milestones Approach for the development of national nuclear infrastructure, which lists 19 important steps for the introduction of nuclear energy.",
            "The 164-page report – Opportunities for the Deployment of Nuclear Energy in Estonia (Tuumaenergia Kasutuselevotmise Voimalused Eestis) said nuclear energy would provide additional support to renewable energy. The Working Party considers that, provided there is timely planning, adequate funding, political and public support, the introduction of nuclear energy in Estonia will be achieved.",
            "According to Antti Tooming, Undersecretary of the Nuclear Energy Working Group, Undersecretary-General of the Ministry of Climate, nuclear energy has proven itself in many countries around the world. “Other energy has the potential to ensure a stable energy supply in Estonia for future generations.” He added that interest in the introduction of nuclear energy, especially SMRs, is currently experiencing major growth around the world. He emphasised that any country that decides in favour of nuclear energy, must not undermine the expansion of renewable energy or delay emission reduction policies. The report notes: “In conclusion, it is important to ensure that the introduction of nuclear energy does not undermine the increase in renewable energy production and storage capacities and does not lead to a delay in reducing emissions.”",
            "The deployment of nuclear energy can make a significant contribution to achieving Estonia's climate goals, ensuring security of supply and stability of the energy system, without limiting the development of renewable energy.",
            "Introducing nuclear energy into a country without previous experience requires years of preparation and the start of power generation from a nuclear power plant would take 9-11 years, the report noted. It will require preparation of a legal framework, the development of competences and site selection as the next steps.",
            "A new public authority must be set up to regulate the safety of nuclear energy, employing a total of about 80 people during operation of the plant. In addition to the existing staff of the Climate & Radiation Department of the Environment Agency, which will be merged into the new body, more than 60 new staff, including 20 specialists in the field of nuclear energy, should be hired, some from abroad for at least the first years.",
            "Assuming NPP construction is financed by the private sector and that the role of the state is to establish a framework for nuclear energy use, from implementation of the nuclear programme to the start of electricity production a total of €73m ($79m) would be needed for the 9-11 year period. A further €54m would be needed over 10 years to support the necessary emergency services and facilities required for nuclear plants.",
            "The report said the introduction of nuclear energy would generate additional revenue in the form of higher tax revenues and the revitalisation of economic activity. This would exceed the cost of establishing and maintaining a national framework during in the plant construction phase. SMRs with a capacity of less than 400 MWe would be suitable in Estonia and the choice of technology should be based on follow experience and fuel supply.",
            "“Although the nuclear power plant plans take into account up to 1200 MW or up to four reactors, the small size of the Baltic Electricity Market, National Renewable Energy and security of supply targets and European carbon-free in view of the likely development of the market for hydrogen products, three or four are envisaged…[if] the reactor is being built on the hydrogen products market instead of electricity generation.”",
            "In the first months of 2024, the Government and Council of the Republic will discuss the possible launch of a nuclear programme. Estonia plans to phase out domestic oil shale by 2035. A draft report by the working group issued in 2022 estimated Estonia could get its first nuclear power plant by 2035. “The long-term sustainability of Estonian oil shale power plants (2035+ view) is declining, as a large part of the plants are old and have less and less competitiveness in the electricity market due to high carbon emissions,” the report notes. “To a certain extent, gas stations are certainly supporting the Estonian electricity system and necessary for Estonia, primarily for providing fast frequency reserves. However, if we talk about covering the base load on a large scale, then a nuclear power plant is potentially the most advantageous solution in terms of electricity price.”",
            "In February 2023, Estonia's privately held nuclear energy company, Fermi Energia, selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 SMR) for deployment in Estonia by the early 2030s. In 2022 Fermi Energia had accepted tenders from US-Japan joint venture GE Hitachi, US-based NuScale and the UK’s Rolls-Royce. Fermi Energia said the criteria for selection were technological maturity, establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness, and participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "In April 2023, four potential locations across Estonia, which could accommodate a NPP were identified by a Finance Ministry analysis. The four locations are at Toila, Ida-Viru County, Kunda, Lääne-Viru County, Loksa, Harju County and Varbla, Pärnu County. The analysis was in effect a feasibility study on whether a nuclear plant would be viable anywhere in Estonia, with the conclusion being that it would be. The analysis was conducted by infrastructure consultancy firm Skepast & Puhkim, whose representative, Triin Lepland, told a press conference that any site selection would take place in stages.",
            "In November 2023, an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) concluded that Estonia had developed a comprehensive assessment of its nuclear power infrastructure needs to enable the government to decide whether to launch a nuclear power programme.",

            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report:",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets’",
            "which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector's progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia's",
            ", the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale's pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance. It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale's VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium developing by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector's early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

The latest agreement is with Terrestrial Energy, signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish.",

ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "Terresrial is developing an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant. The IMSR is a 442 MWt per Core-unit (IMSR400) small modular molten salt fuelled, graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactor. Terrestrial Energy has developed a two-unit configuration which can deliver 884 MWt/390 MWe. The design features a completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers and shutdown rods all mounted inside a single vessel – the IMSR core-unit. The sealed core-unit is replaced completely at the end of its useful service life (nominally seven years). This allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. Terrestrial says it operates at the high temperature required for broad industrial relevance with transformative economic potential.",

These uses include the IMSR plant’s role in decarbonising energy-intensive and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The parties will also consider frameworks for development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications in the UAE and other markets.",
            "H.E. Mohamed Al Hammadi commented: “We are committed to exploring the latest technologies in advanced reactors as we continue to rapidly decarbonise the power sector through clean electricity from nuclear energy…. We look forward to close collaboration with Terrestrial Energy as we identify the potential deployment of IMSR technology in the UAE and overseas.”",
            "Simon Irish said the IMSR has immense potential to support industrial growth and decarbonisation. “Terrestrial Energy’s prioritisation of national and international regulatory requirements supports the aims of our MOU as does the IMSR’s use of nuclear fuel at standard enrichment levels, which has long-established international acceptance. We look forward to working with ENEC to accelerate development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications and commercial markets.”",
            "In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against Canadian regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.",
            "The conventional nuclear power plant fuel used by the IMSR – Standard Assay Low Enriched Uranium – is the only fuel available and transportable today for civilian reactor use and has international regulatory acceptance. Its use supports an early deployment path for IMSR plants across multiple markets. In August 2023, Terrestrial Energy signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a UK-based subsidiary of Westinghouse, for the design and construction of an IMSR fuel pilot plant."

The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK – are those considered most able to deliver operating reactors by the mid-2030s and support the UK’s ambitions to reach 24 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Gwen Parry-Jones, CEO of Great British Nuclear, explained: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029.”",
            "The SMR competition is part of a plan for the UK to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy. A nuclear power revival is a central plank of that strategy and the companies through to the next stage will be invited to bid for government contracts later this year. The winning bidders are expected to be announced in spring next year and contracts are due to be awarded in the summer. Announcing the initial tranche of winning entrants, UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: “Small Modular Reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.”",
            "EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited are the companies that have been chosen for the next stage of the process. Key design details and developments are outlined below:",
            "EDF’s NUWARDTM is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor with an integrated primary loop producing 340 MWe from two independent reactors rated at 170 MWe each or 540 MWth. The two units will be housed in a single building and will share common equipment where possible.",
            "According to EDF, the design is focused on standardisation, modular manufacturing and simplicity for in-factory mass production, and flexibility in the construction and operation phases. Furthermore, the design has been developed to support load following and adapted for non-electric uses. With a design availability of around 90%, the fuel cycle is two years and the service life is 60 years. The core features 76 fuel assemblies.",
            "In March this year, EDF created the NUWARD subsidiary in line with its objective to achieve first nuclear concrete in 2030 for its reference SMR plant in France. After finalising the conceptual design, NUWARD is now shifting to the basic design phase.",
            "The NUWARD subsidiary will continue to work with historic partners CEA, TechnicAtome, Naval Group as well as new partners Framatome and Tractebel who were onboarded last year. Tractebel will be responsible for the civil engineering preliminary studies and the evaluation of costs, for example.",
            "Earlier this year EDF submitted the NUWARD design to France’s Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority), marking the start of the pre-licensing process while in June 2022, EDF announced that the design would be the case study for a European early joint regulatory review led by ASN with participation from Finland’s Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB).",
            "Renaud Crassous, NUWARD’s President said: “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the NUWARDTM SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030”.",
            "According to EDF’s SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years.",
            "GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR generating 870 MWth that is based on a larger BWR that is already licensed and operating. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is a Generation III+ reactor certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. The SMR version, the BWRX-300, uses natural circulation and passive cooling isolation condenser systems as well as fully passive safety systems. It’s fuel enrichment, averaging 3.81% and with a 4.95% maximum, puts it firmly in the realms of conventional commercially available fuels and it has a design refueling cycle of 12-24 months as well as a 60-year operational design life.",
            "The construction technologies incorporated into the design adopt advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques that have been proven in the oil and gas, tunneling and power industries. As a result of this approach and using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, GE Hitachi suggests the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in as little as 24-36 months while also achieving an approximate 90% volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW it should also account for around half the amount of concrete. As with other SMR designs, the BWRX-300 claims a cost-competitive approach that can be deployed for both electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating.",
            "An advanced reactor, GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 sets itself apart from other SMR designs with its proven, less complicated attributes and anticipates the design will be deployable globally as early as 2029 thanks to proven know-how and innovative construction techniques. Launched in 2017, the SMR is the 10th evolution of the BWR light water reactor design from GE.",
            "The design has achieved some notable success. This year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to explore the construction of multiple advanced nuclear reactors including proposals for a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site, starting with a plant design and an NRC license application with a view to potentially getting an operational SMR at the site around 2032. Meanwhile, last year Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) selected the BWRX-300 for single-unit project that was initially anticipated to begin operating as early as 2028.",
            "Holtec’s SMR-160+ small modular reactor is a PWR that uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The design, which has been in development since 2010, features a reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components that are located underground, as well as a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down or dissipate decay heat. A key part of the SMR-160 roll-out as envisioned by Holtec is to deploy the reactor as a replacement for the boilers found in coal-fired power stations and reusing the majority of the existing assets. The use of multi-stage compressors that are capable of uprating SMR-160’s steam (700 psi @ 595 Deg F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant are a critical part of this plan. Furthermore, the ability of the SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure also opens new development opportunities, such as using high-pressure steam for industrial applications.",
            "Having been shortlisted, the aim is to start construction of the first UK SMR-160 unit as early as 2028 and Holtec intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s in serial production by 2050 across the UK, amounting to 5.1 GW.",
            "This year South Korean national financial institutions K-Sure (Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) and Kexim (Export-Import Bank of Korea) signed agreements with Holtec and Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to provide financial support for SMR-160 projects around the world.",
            "Holtec has a collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C from late 2021 that will see Hyundai perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction. The reactor will be initially manufactured at Holtec’s Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus in Camden, New Jersey.",
            "The SMR-160 design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "More recently, Ukraine’s nuclear generating company Energoatom signed a cooperation agreement that envisions implementation of an SMR-160 pilot project with targeted grid connection by March 2029. The deal further contemplates up to 20 additional SMR-160 units in Ukraine and a manufacturing facility.",
            "The NuScale SMR is a PWR dubbed the NuScale Power Module. This a small PWR is designed to generate 77 MWe at 250 MWth and with be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGRTM SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. It will use standard light water reactor fuel and is the only small modular reactor to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As with other SMR designs, the NuScale Power Module was developed to supply electricity but also potentially generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications. The design features passive operating and safety systems and the modules are submerged in a pool built below ground level.",
            "NuScale SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries and the first project is expected to begin operation in 2029 in Idaho. NuScale has already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components and, in May, South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility began producing forgings for the first VOYGR-6 power plant to be built for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "Earlier this year Polish metals company KGHM Polska MiedzKGHM received preliminary state approval for a planned SMR which followed on from a 2022 agreement with NuScale to work on deploying a VOYGR plant in Poland by 2029.",
            "A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed this year by Romanian nuclear utility SNN, NuScale, Romanian companies E-INFRA and Nova Power & Gas, US-based Fluor Enterprises and South Korea’s Samsung C&T Corporation to collaborate on the deployment of VOYGR plants in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania aims to be the first country in Europe to deploy a VOYGR SMR and earlier this month Romania’s National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities approved the Licensing Basis Document for the NuScale design.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWth. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK where it has completed the first phase and is expected to complete the second step by July 2024.",
            "Commenting on the shortlisting, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce SMR CEO, said: “We have the only SMR technology in a European regulatory approval process, putting us almost two years ahead of any of our competitors. Securing a domestic contract is vitally important to unlock the enormous global export potential of our clean energy technology.”",
            "This year Rolls-Royce SMR and Sumitomo Corporation completed a joint feasibility study which shows the reactor could offer a significant advantage for the production of low-carbon hydrogen when cost, availability and carbon emissions are taken into consideration.",
            "The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finnish power company Fortum to explore opportunities for the deployment of SMRs in Finland and Sweden. Last year Fortum began a two-year feasibility study to explore necessary conditions for deployment of SMRs.",
            "A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs and expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s. Rolls-Royce is also discussing deployment of its SMR with the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and the Netherlands.",
            "The Westinghouse AP300TM small modular reactor is currently the only SMR based on a licensed, operating nuclear reactor design. Launched in May this year, the design is derived from the operating AP1000 PWR which makes it unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks. It is an advanced, Generation III+ single-loop pressurised light water reactor.",
            "It utilises the same engineering, components and supply chain as the AP1000 which Westinghouse says will thus enable streamlined licensing and leveraging of available technical skills. The company adds that the advantageous economics of the AP300 are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development. Four AP1000 units are operating in China with a further six under construction and one is operating at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, USA, while a second is nearing completion there. The simplified, modular, ultra-compact nuclear island also reduces construction costs and schedule, Westinghouse says. For these reasons the company argues that it is confident that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "The AP300 SMR features advanced passive safety systems designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown condition without operator action, back-up power or pumps and has an output of 300 MWe from 990 MWth.",
            "Commenting, Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO said: “We look forward to this opportunity to demonstrate that the AP300 SMR is the best option for the UK.”",
            "Earlier this year Westinghouse Electric Company and Finland’s Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the possibilities for the development and deployment of AP300 reactor projects in Finland and Sweden. This deal was followed by a similar MoU agreement with Slovak state-owned nuclear company JAVYS and another with Ukraine’s Energoatom.",
            "The successful development of SMRs could completely transform how nuclear power stations are built and result in billions of pounds of investment in the UK and elsewhere. The flexibility of design means that SMRs could also play a significant role is decarbonising hard-to-reach sectors like chemicals, building materials and other energy-intensive industries. Although six companies’ designs have been shortlisted for the next phase of the UK competition, much will depend on a successful roll out of the winning designs, not just in the UK but much further afield too. SMRs clearly offer much promise but the success of SMRs will also mark a key breakthrough for nuclear technology more broadly."

            "Poland's Climate & Environment Ministry issued decisions-in-principle for the construction at six locations of BWRX-300 small modular reactors (SMRs). A total of 24 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactors are planned for the sites.",
            "Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) in April shortlisted seven locations in Poland for further geological surveys to host SMR plants based on GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300, for which it holds the exclusive right in Poland. The locations were: Ostrołęka, Włocławek, Stawy Monowskie, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Nowa Huta, Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone and Warsaw.",
            "OSGE then submitted applications to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for decisions-in-principle on the construction of SMRs all those locations except Warsaw.",
            "The Ministry’s decisions-in-principle for the six locations is the first step in the process of administrative permits for investments in nuclear power facilities in Poland. This entitles OSGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "Rafał Kasprów, President of OSGE’s Management Board announced the decisions during the Net Zero Nuclear forum at the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai. \"The decisions enable us to launch a programme to build a fleet of BWRX-300 reactors in Poland to provide zero-emission, stable energy sources for the energy, industry and heating sectors,\" he said.",
            "GE Hitachi, BWXT Canada and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) in December 2021, signed a Letter of Intent to cooperate in deploying BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland. OSGE – a joint venture between chemical producers SGE and PKN Orlen applied to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency in July 2022 for the assessment of the reactor design.",
            "However, the Climate Ministry’s positive decision has been thrown into doubt after the Internal Security Agency (ABW – Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) issued a negative opinion on the plans, according to Polish media. Polityka weekly reported that the ABW noted that the Climate Ministry is required to obtain the ABW’s opinion as part of its assessment of the nuclear project.",
            "While ABW’s opinion is not binding, a negative assessment makes it unlikely the Ministry would approve the SMR plans, according to industry news service Energetyka24. OSGE confirmed that the ABW had issued a negative opinion but issued a statement strongly objecting to the agency’s assessment. OSGE accused ABW of being “incompetent and irresponsible” in the context of Poland’s increasingly urgent need for an energy transition away from coal. It also called for the agency’s reasoning for its decision to be declassified.",
            "“In the course of more than 230 days of proceedings, the ABW did not once meet with either the applicant, OSGE, the technology supplier, US-based GE-Hitachi, or see the data on the proposed locations,” company said in a statement. “We do not know on what basis ABW issued its opinions.” OSGE said its requests to declassify ABW’s reasons for its opinion had been rejected and that it would pursue the case further in court. “We are convinced that these are neither substantive nor professional reasons.”",
            "Business Insider said the negative ABW decision was known in the Ministry and to OSGE at least a month ago, both of which had appealed against it. Business Insider's unnamed source officials at the Ministry of Climate repudiated ABW’s opinion which reportedly concerned the technology itself. Pressed for are consideration of the decision, ABW issued a negative opinion for the second time, Business insider noted.",
            "Reporting on the dispute, TVN24 Business cited OSGE as saying:",
            "\"The world is moving towards both large and SMR nuclear technologies, as confirmed by the current COP28 global climate conference. To achieve the goals of decarbonising Polish energy, many state and private investments are needed.” The company insisted that it had been \"transparently\" conducting the process of implementing technology from the beginning. ABW had provided \" neither substantive nor professional reasons\". OSGE added “will continue its licensing, environmental and location activities related to the construction of the BWRX-300 fleet for the needs of Polish industry, heating and energy\".",
            "TVN24 also received a statement from ABW, which said, as a public authority it “acts only on the basis and within the limits of law”. Minister and Coordinator of Special Services Mariusz Kamiński defended the ABW decision accusing OSGE of “manipulations and lies”. He added: “Before issuing an opinion, the Agency conducts a multi-element opinion procedure aimed at assessing the impact of the indicated investment on the internal security of the state.\" With respect to the application submitted by OSGE, “it should be noted that in the opinion of ABW, the investment carried out by the company unduly protects the interests of the Treasury, including Orlen”. He insisted that the activities of ABW were aimed at \"soundly safeguarding the interests of the Republic of Poland, and were conducted in accordance with the regulations and maintaining the highest standards\".",
            "These developments come amid uncertainty about what is going to be the next government's stance on nuclear energy, following elections in October. Opposition leader Donald Tusk is hoping to lead a coalition government of three opposition groups. His statements indicate that he is in favour of large-scale nuclear. “Nuclear power plants are essential. We are out of time,” he said in November. However, according to PAP, his view on SMRs is less clear. Commenting on the OSGE-ABW dispute he noted that “this civil war” between state institutions “on such an important issue must raise concern”. He criticised Orlen and the government for ignoring the ABW’s concerns and pushing ahead with the plans.",
            "Earlier, the Ministry of Climate & Environment issued decisions-in-principle for the construction of two large nuclear power plants: one for a 3750 MWe plant in Pomerania using Westinghouse's AP1000 technology, the other for a plant comprising two South Korean-supplied APR1400 reactors in the Patnów-Konin region. A decision-in-principle was also issued for copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA's plan to construct a NuScale VOYGR SMR."

            "The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has signed three more memorandums of understanding (MOUs) related to small modular reactors at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the original 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai. The latest agreements are with US-based small modular reactor (SMR) developers X-energy and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) as well as with UK-based developer of molten salt nuclear technology MoltexFLEX.",
            "Earlier at COP28 ENEC signed three agreements with US SMR and micro-reactor vendors – GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), TerraPower and Westinghouse Electric. The agreements came after ENEC launched its ADVANCE programme, in the run up to CO28, aimed at leveraging the UAE’s experience in successfully delivering the four-unit Barakah NPP, constructed in Abu Dhabi by a South Korean consortium. ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "The MOU with MoltexFLEX was signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and MoltexFLEX CEO David Landon in the presence of British Ambassador to the UAE Edward Hobart and representatives from the UK government. Under the MOU with a joint working group will be set up to examine the commercial viability of deploying MoltexFLEX's 60 MWt/24 MWe FLEX molten salt reactor in the UAE. The FLEX reactor design – a thermal neutron (moderated) version of Moltex Energy's stable salt reactor technology – was launched by Moltex Energy subsidiary MoltexFLEX in September 2022.",
            "ENEC and MoltexFLEX will assess using FLEX reactors for a range of industrial applications including desalination, hydrogen production and electricity generation. “We will also explore opportunities throughout the Middle East and beyond, which is aligned with MoltexFLEX’s vision for global deployment of the FLEX reactor,” Landon said.",
            "ENEC’s MOU with USNC seeks to jointly explore commercial development of USNC's Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) energy systems and paves the way for potential commercialisation of the MMR in the UAE, USNC said. Further areas of collaboration within the UAE include workforce and supply chain development and project delivery, along with a potential framework for ENEC to lead MMR deployments across the region in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and other areas covered by the Three Seas Initiative. Dr Francesco Venneri, USNC Founder & CEO said the MMR “will play an important role for Emiratis as the nation continues towards deep decarbonisation hand-in-hand with prosperity for Emiratis and other nations across the region”.",
            "The MMR features the high temperature helium-cooled MMR unit providing up to 45 MWt of heat, delivered into a centralised heat storage unit which can combine the heat from one or more reactors. Electric power or superheated steam can then be extracted from the storage unit for various uses. USNC has also developed and patented its own TRISO-based, additively manufactured FCM fuel for use in the MMR.",
            "The MOU with X-energy, signed by Al Hammadi and X-energy CEO Clay Sell will see the two parties work together to assess technical design and commercial viability of X-energy's nuclear technologies for the UAE market, to meet the growing demand for clean electricity generation, along with generating steam, heat and hydrogen to decarbonise industry. The companies will also evaluate potential project partnerships for developments in the UK and Europe and will develop a regional deployment framework for ENEC-led projects in the Middle East, Africa, and Indian subcontinent, X-energy said.",
            "X-energy is developing the Xe-100 pebble bed high-temperature gas reactor as well as proprietary TRISO-X tri-structural isotropic encapsulated particle fuel. \"Our partnership will explore the many ways we can combine X-energy's leading technology with ENEC's delivery expertise to address a broad range of decarbonisation challenges in the region and around the world,\" said Sell.",
            "The statement on the MOU said the agreement also helps advance the US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and aims to help catalyse $100bn in clean energy and decarbonisation projects by 2035. A White House fact sheet noted that PACE “intends to tap available resources and public and private sector expertise in the US and the UAE and expedite investment in and deployment of new technologies to drive down cost”. PACE also “supports the full-scale implementation of the civil nuclear cooperation between the US and the UAE. The three earlier MOUs with GEH, TerraPower and Westinghouse also cited PACE as the context for their co-operation with ENEC, indicating the key role of the US in the signing of these agreements.",
            "In March, ENEC had also signed a letter of intent with the US Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as a basis for discussions regarding INL working with ENEC on clean molecule generation systems that could be deployed at the Barakah NPP such as hydrogen, ammonia, oxygen, water and steam, with the long-term view to export clean hydrogen and ammonia to meet growing global demand. INL also announced its intention to partner with ENEC on its Net-Zero Nuclear platform at COP28.",
            "Relations with the US were also strengthened during COP28. An MOU signed between the UK Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) and ENEC paved the way to “explore potential collaboration opportunities in the deployment of large-scale nuclear reactors, in addition to advanced nuclear technologies (including small modular reactors), as well as a host of related fields, from nuclear security to the supply of nuclear fuel”. ENEC and DESNZ will also share lessons learned in project delivery of large-scale reactors, as well as efficiency improvements, best practices in government and commercial project financing, and site and technology selection. Al Hammadi noted that the Net Zero Nuclear summit was “the perfect platform to sign and agree on new areas of cooperation with trusted partners as we collectively work towards faster climate action”.",

In addition to investing in both countries’ clean energy futures, the aim is to promote climate action “by vigorously pursuing and encouraging investment in clean energy in emerging economies”. Among other things, PACE “intends to tap available resources and public and private sector expertise in the US and the UAE and expedite investment in and deployment of new technologies to drive down cost”. PACE also “supports the full-scale implementation of the civil nuclear cooperation between the US and the UAE.",
            "Within the framework of these two programmes, ENEC during COP28 signed memoranda of understanding (MOUs) with GEH to explore potential of its BWRX-300 SMR design; TerraPower, which is developing the Natrium sodium fast reactor with molten salt energy storage; and Westinghouse with its eVinci microreactor design.",
            "The MOU with GEH will explore potential BWRX-300 deployment in the UAE for electricity generation and non-traditional applications, including a potential framework for ENEC to lead a broader regional deployment of the technology in the Middle East and Africa. They will also consider opportunities to collaborate on engineering, workforce, supply chain development supporting projects within the UAE.",

            "US-based TerraPower has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the UAE’s Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) on the sidelines of COP28 to explore opportunities for the commercialisation and global deployment of Terrapower’s Natrium technology. “Bringing advanced nuclear technologies to market is critical to meeting global decarbonisation targets,” said TerraPower President & CEO Chris Levesque. “TerraPower and ENEC are leading the way in deploying nuclear plants, and this agreement allows us to share our expertise and design experience, and explore the opportunity for deployment of Natrium reactors around the world including additional locations in the United States.”",
            "TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are developing the Natrium technology, which features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. According to Terrapower, this “allows a Natrium plant to integrate seamlessly with renewable resources and leads to faster, more cost-effective decarbonisation of the electric grid while producing dispatchable carbon-free energy”. The first Natrium plant is being developed in the US in Kemmerer, Wyoming, near a retiring coal plant and is planned to enter operation within a decade. Development of the first Natrium demonstration plant is supported by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",
            "The UAE has a strong civil nuclear programme which began operation in 2020. Construction of its Barakah NPP began in 2011. Korea Electric Power Company (Kepco) led the consortium that is building the plant comprising four APR1400 reactors. To date three units have been connected to the grid and unit 4 completed hot functional testing in July 2023 in preparation for commercial operation in 2024.",
            "ENEC Managing Director & CEO Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, said nuclear is at the heart of UAE’s clean energy progress and strategy. “Our new agreement with TerraPower will facilitate cooperation in taking nuclear energy technology to the next level, by accelerating its deployment and its use for innovating new solutions including the production of clean molecules and hydrogen.”",

            "A few days before, TerraPower signed an MOU with the US Uranium Energy with objectives of reestablishing domestic supply chains of uranium fuel. TerraPower and UEC will explore the potential supply of uranium for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor and energy storage system. Terrapower said small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactors represent “the fastest growing segment of nuclear energy in the United States and need a secure, domestic fuel supply chain”. The first step of the supply chain is uranium, “and UEC’s Wyoming resources have the critical mass to be a highly reliable source of uranium for American HALEU [high assay low enriched uranium] and a good strategic fit to supply TerraPower’s Natrium reactor”.",
            "Wyoming’s Governor Mark Gordon stated: “This MOU is a great step forward for the Wyoming uranium industry, which is host to the largest uranium reserves in the United States. It makes no sense to depend on Russian uranium and enrichment technology, when a fully domestic fuel source can be found here in Wyoming and manufactured in the United States.”",
            "UEC President & CEO Amir Adnani welcomed the prospect of providing the uranium needed to operate the Wyoming Natrium reactor. “In these geopolitically complex times, UEC’s vision is to be the leading provider of conflict-free, American uranium for the existing, as well as the new reactors that will come online.”",
            "UEC’s Wyoming production platform includes a portfolio of over 20 uranium projects, that in total contain the largest S-K 1300 compliant resource base in the United States. Four of the projects in the Powder River Basin are fully permitted for in-situ recovery (ISR) production including the Irigaray Central Processing Plant and Christensen Ranch ISR facilities in Johnson County, Wyoming where UEC’s initial production will be focused.",
            "In August, Terrapower selected four suppliers to support its Natrium Reactor Demonstration Project saying the contracts will help to establish key elements of the supply chain that the advanced reactor industry will require as new reactors are brought to market. In July Terrapower and US Centrus agreed to collaborate to ensure the demonstration reactor has access to HALEU to ensure that the project’s 2030 operation date can be met.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under theARDP, including two planned demonstration reactors – Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors. TerraPower and Centrus have been working together since 2021 to help expedite the commercialisation of domestic enrichment technology at Centrus’s Piketon, Ohio, facility.",
            "In December 2022, TerraPower said it expected operation of the Natrium demonstration reactor to be delayed by at least two years from 2028 to 2030 because of the lack of commercial capacity to HALEU in time to meet the proposed targets “We had a plan. It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first core load of fuel come from Russia,” Terrapower said at the time.",
            "However, even if sufficient HALEU is available, the 2030 target date may be optimistic. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. DOE in July 2022 issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades.",

ARC Clean Technology has offices in Saint John, New Brunswick and Washington, DC.",
            "NB Power President & CEO Lori Clark welcomed the collaboration and expansion of existing partnerships and potential future commercialisation opportunities. “Small modular reactors are a key part of NB Power’s solution to phase out coal by 2030 and achieve net-zero supply by 2035, while maintaining energy security,” she said. “This is an example of our Strategic Plan: Energising our Future in action, finding new, cleaner and greener energy solutions and building partnerships.",
            "Jooho Whang, KHNP CEO would offer significant momentum for entering the Generation 4 SMR market. “While our tripartite collaboration is in its early stages, I am confident that, leveraging our extensive know-how gained through 40 years of development and operation of nuclear reactors both at home and abroad, we can advance strengthened by a solid partnership with NB Power and ARC Clean Technology.”",
            "Since 2018, ARC and NB Power have been working together on the development of the ARC-100, a modular 100 MWe integrated sodium-cooled fast reactor with a metallic uranium alloy core. The design is based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) fast reactor prototype which operated at the USA's Argonne National Laboratory from 1961 to 1994. ARC Nuclear signed an agreement with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in March 2017 to collaborate on the development and licensing of an SMR using proprietary technology from GEH's PRISM reactor, which is also based on the EBR-II.",
            "However, all fast reactor projects in Europe and North America were essentially abandoned in the 1970s and 1980s and had effectively ceased in Europe and the US by the 1990s. Although interest in fast reactor technology is now reviving in Europe and the USA, both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the design phase. The projected operation dates for the ARC-100 may, therefore, prove to be optimistic. Currently fast reactor development continues apace only in Russia, China and India, where there are now five fast reactors in operation and five more under development.",

The privately owned VBWR operated from 1957 to 1963 at the Vallecitos Nuclear Centre (VNC) in Alameda County some 48 km east of San Francisco. The VBWR was the first NPP to deliver significant quantities of electricity to a public utility grid and the first NPP to receive an operating licence issued by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).",
            "Removal of the VBWR is part of ongoing work to rehabilitate the VNC site for commercial or industrial use. NorthStar agreed in May to take ownership of the site from GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) for nuclear decontamination, decommissioning, and environmental site restoration. NorthStar and GEH are currently awaiting the regulatory approvals necessary to enable full transfer of the site and associated licence to NorthStar.",
            "After more than a year of planning, the reactor vessel – nine feet in diameter, 22 feet tall and weighing more than 100,000 pounds — was prepared for shipment and removed by NorthStar. The reactor was first loaded onto a highway transport system and then into a specially configured railcar at a rail transload facility for direct transfer by rail to WCS’s disposal facility in Texas where it will be safely disposed.",
            "From 1965 to 1975, VNC undertook research for AEC’s nuclear energy programme and the civilian nuclear power industry. As well as the VBWR, the site hosted a Radioactive Materials Laboratory where post-irradiation examinations were carried outas well as a small 100kW Nuclear Test Reactor that used U-AL alloy fuel and was used for non-destructive material imaging. VNC also fabricated radioactive source materials for medicine and industry, under a California State licence. In May GEH announced cessation of all operations at the Centre and its intention to transfer the site to NorthStar for decommissioning.",
            "The 5 MWe VBWR was a light-water moderated and cooled, enriched uranium reactor using stainless steel-clad, plate-type fuel. It was a pilot plant and test bed for fuel, core components, controls, and personnel training for Commonwealth Edison’s Dresden Nuclear Power Plant, which was built in Illinois five years later. The plant was originally collaboration between General Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric Company, with Bechtel Corporation serving as engineering contractor.",
            "The VBWR plan was approved by General Electric’s management in late 1955. Construction began in June 1956 and the reactor went critical in 1957. The plant’s cost was well below the original estimate. It was built entirely with private funds. The entire privately owned VNC area is now managed by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Legacy Management as a Manhattan Engineer District/Atomic Energy Commission Legacy Site.",
            "After its closure, the VBWR was deactivated, defuelled, and put into SAFESTOR status pending eventual decommissioning. Waste removal from VNC began in September 2009 and was completed in 2010. Most of the nuclear waste generated from decontamination work was transuranic waste (TRU) that consisted of clothing, tools, rags, debris, and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive TRU elements. The TRU waste was packaged and shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico, for permanent disposal. Decontamination and restoration activities are conducted in compliance with the requirements and licence provisions of NRC and the California Department of Health.",

Based on the Roadmap, small modular reactor (SMR) technology will be included in the State Energy Policy and recognised in the Spatial Development Policy of the Czech Republic. The Roadmap provides an overview of possible sites and investment models.",
            "“Small and medium-sized reactors will be a great addition to the modern power system of the Czech Republic, both in terms of electricity and heat generation,” said Minister of Industry & Trade Jozef Síkela. “Our vision is for SMRs to complement large nuclear units from the 2030s-40s onwards. In this way, we will capitalise on the unique know-how of our nuclear industry. The approved Roadmap will provide investors with certainty, so that they can prepare sites and subsequently make investment decisions.\" He added: \"This will give Czech companies the opportunity to participate in supply chains of Czech and foreign projects in the future, to look for partners abroad and play an important role in the development of this promising field. This is an exceptional opportunity to succeed in a high value-added industry.”",
            "The Ministry noted that work is underway on a number of designs, with their representatives having expressed interest in cooperating with Czech companies. Interested companies include Rolls-Royce SMR and GE Hitachi, “which, according to the latest information, are most advanced in the development of a functional SMR”. Joint development between Czech and foreign companies in the form of a joint venture is also being considered.",
            "The 30-page Roadmap summarises the current situation with respect to SMRs and outlines the suggestions of a working group that met throughout 2022 and 2023 under the Ministry’s leadership. It sets out the framework for possible application of SMR technology in the Czech Republic, outlines approaches to economic opportunities, provides information on Czech SMR designs, and on offers from foreign manufacturers. It also suggests suitable sites, details investor models and necessary legislative changes.",
            "The government resolution now assigns tasks with the aim of creating a suitable investor environment, based on the so-called taxonomy. The Roadmap recommends speeding up the process of site selection and preparation in order to start construction in the first half of 2030s. In addition to existing nuclear sites, promising locations include coal-fired power plants such as Dětmarovice and Tisová.",
            "\"Due to their size and power output, these reactors can be a suitable replacement for coal-fired power plants which are being phased out,” said Deputy Minister Petr Třešňák. “Apart from current nuclear sites, which were primarily intended for the construction of classic nuclear reactors, SMRs can be sited at other locations. These need to be identified and prepared in time. That, too, is what the Roadmap is exploring.\"",
            "Deputy Senior Director of the Ministry’s Energy & Nuclear Resources Section Tomáš Ehler noted that the first implemented SMR projects and operating experience will indicate their economic viability and the preparation and construction times involved. “The aim of the Roadmap and its implementation is to give us a head-start in using the technology in and in supporting the export potential of Czech companies,\" he said.",
            "The report says: “Governments of the countries of origin of the manufacturers are supporting the emergence of an innovative fleet-based approach to the production and construction of nuclear power plants to make their construction more efficient and accessible, in particular by reducing overall investment and operating costs. For the Czech Republic, joining the supply chain and producing modules in the Czech Republic is a strategic opportunity that would mean the development of a new economic focus, the maintenance of nuclear know-how, a long–term partnership with the country of origin of the manufacturer and the fulfilment of the decarbonisation strategy of the Czech Republic.”",
            "It adds that despite the potentially higher investment costs per power unit, ranging from CZK100m (S4.4m) to CZK165m, “the total nominal investment in SMRs will be significantly lower than for large-scale reactors”. This will “make investment into nuclear in the form of SMRs accessible to a wider range of stakeholders, including private capital involvement”.",
            "Although SMR technology has now been included in the Czech State Energy Policy “some uncertainties persist today with potentially significant implications for the future of the energy sector in the Czech Republic and the possible role of SMRs”. These include the European Union electricity market reform, international efforts to harmonise SMR legislation, and the government‘s consideration of the nationalisation of energy assets. “For this reason, there are tasks… that will have to be resolved in cooperation with all stakeholders on an ongoing basis… especially by finding a consensus on how to finance and publicly support the construction of SMRs for selected investor models.",
            "The report says that,without the participation of the State, it will not be possible to use the maximum potential of SMRs in the Czech Republic, which could be important in terms of ensuring energy security. “The State must guarantee national security in the context of SMRs, as it does for large nuclear power plants, in terms of nuclear safety, physical security, radiation protection, personnel and competence or other threats to the public interest through existing and new regulatory and legislative instruments.”",
            "Citing assessments by the Czech Transmission System Operator of resource adequacy to 2040, the report says not even new renewable energy projects together with four new large reactors will cover the needs of the Czech Republic “and up to 3 GWe of additional power will be needed by 2050”.

        "text": [
            "ARC Clean Technology Supply Chain Manager, Anthony Jackman says the procurement process for long-lead items for the ARC-100 commercial demonstration unit at Canada’s Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station, such as the reactor vessel and intermediate heat exchangers, will begin in 2024. Contract awards are expected in the latter part of 2025 and the procurement schedule for other items will follow, he told “New Brunswick SMRs: A Collaborative Journey Towards Net Zero”. The meeting was a supply chain event for New Brunswick small modular reactor (SMR) industry leaders, government officials and experts hosted by Opportunities New Brunswick.",
            "Speaking to stakeholders involved in New Brunswick’s SMR future, he noted: “SMRs are a new way to construct nuclear power plants. The unique ARC-100 design has a small nuclear island, which reduces the amount of specialised equipment and hardware. This increases the opportunity for New Brunswick companies that currently supply similar services to heavy industry to participate in the construction of the ARC-100 plant beginning with the first unit.”",
            "ARC, in partnership with NB Power, aims to commission an ARC-100 unit at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station by the end of the decade. In June of 2023, NB Power submitted a licence to prepare site application to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, making it one of only three SMR projects in Canada with a submitted licence application to prepare a site. ARC plans to manufacture ARC-100 units in New Brunswick for export to other jurisdictions, creating economic benefits for the province.",
            "ARC Clean Technology President & CEO Bill Labbe said: “Momentum is building, and the time has come for us to work together to build the plan for a robust SMR supply chain that will bring significant economic benefits to our province.”",
            "The ARC-100 is a 100 MWe integrated sodium-cooled fast reactor with a metallic uranium alloy core. The design is based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) fast reactor prototype which operated at the USA's Argonne National Laboratory from 1961 to 1994. ARC Nuclear signed an agreement with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in March 2017 to collaborate on the development and licensing of an SMR using proprietary technology from GEH's PRISM reactor, which is also based on the EBR-II.",
            "However, all fast reactor projects in Europe and North America were essentially abandoned in the 1970s and 1980s and had effectively ceased in Europe and the US by the 1990s. Although interest in fast reactor technology is now reviving in Europe and the USA, both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the design phase. The projected operation dates for the ARC-100 may, therefore, prove to be optimistic. Currently fast reactor development continues apace only in Russia, China and India, where there are now five fast reactors in operation and five more under development.",

Southern said this milestone underscores the industry’s effort to optimise fuel, enabling increased fuel efficiency and long-term affordability for nuclear power plants.",
            "Southern Nuclear President Pete Sena said nuclear power accounts for almost half of US clean energy, “and Southern Nuclear is committed to pushing for innovative, game-changing technologies like the deployment of Accident Tolerant Fuel that will advance performance and further support our ability to strengthen grid reliability with 24/7 generation”. He added: “Realising the significant role nuclear power plays in our country’s energy infrastructure, I especially want to recognise the NRC’s thorough yet timely review of this installation to support the future of commercial nuclear power in our country.”",
            "In 2022, Southern Nuclear signed an agreement with Westinghouse to load four lead test assemblies (LTAs) with next-generation fuel features into Vogtle 2. The LTAs use key components from Westinghouse’s High Energy Fuel initiative and the EnCore Fuel programme. These features include ADOPTTM uranium dioxide pellets, AXIOMTM fuel rod cladding and chromium-coated cladding combined with Westinghouse’s advanced PRIMETM fuel assembly design. With regulatory authorisation, Southern Nuclear and Westinghouse are moving forward with the manufacturing these first-of-a-kind fuel assemblies with planned installation in early 2025.",
            "“Members of Congress and the Department of Energy have demonstrated their deep understanding of the positive impacts of Accident Tolerant Fuel, and their support has been critical to our ability to advance fuel technology with higher burnup rates,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “We are grateful to Southern Nuclear for their trust and look forward to delivering advanced technologies that will bolster the light water fleet and support the low-cost generation of nuclear power in the long term.”",
            "Authorisation of enrichments above 5 wt.% uranium-235 is part of broader efforts by industry to develop and deploy batch quantities of advanced fuel technologies which are a set of new technologies that enable higher enrichment and have the potential to enhance safety at NPPs by offering better performance during normal operation, transient conditions and accident scenarios.",
            "The enrichment authorisation is a component of a broader LTA programme that will demonstrate performance of advanced fuel assemblies developed by Westinghouse with significant support from the Department of Energy’s enhanced ATF programme.",
            "Southern Nuclear has led the commercial nuclear industry in incremental deployment of enhanced ATF technology, having been the first in the world to install GE-Hitachi ATF fuel cladding technologies in 2018 at Plant Hatch unit 1 with samples subsequently discharged and shipped to Oak Ridge National Lab for further testing in 2020. At Vogtle 2 in 2019, Southern installed four Framatome-developed GAIA lead fuel assemblies containing enhanced accident-tolerant features applied to full-length fuel rods.",
            "Southern said that, along with DOE, fuel suppliers and peer utilities, it is executing “a coordinated, overarching, multi-year effort through the Nuclear Energy Institute’s ATF Working Group to expand the regulatory paradigm to meet the industry goal of safely and economically enabling 24-month cycle operations for all operating plants with enhanced ATF features”.",

The government and GBM said the chosen designs are considered as the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s. The next stage of the process will be launched as soon as possible where successful companies will shortly be able to bid for government contracts. The aim is to announce in Spring 2024 which of the companies the government will support, with contracts awarded by Summer 2024. “This timetable aims to make this competition the fastest of its kind in the world,” DESNZ noted.",
            "The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) competition is part of the government’s plan to revive nuclear power and for the UK to lead the global race to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper energy and greater energy security. The government aims for up to a quarter of all UK electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The statement pointed out that, “as well as backing SMRs and other emerging nuclear technologies, the government is also investing in the large-scale project at Sizewell C, a near exact replica of Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be in construction for over a generation”.",
            "Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said SMRs “will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy for British families and businesses, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and grow the economy”. She added: “This competition has attracted designs from around the world and puts the UK at the front of the global race to develop this exciting, cutting-edge technology and cement our position as a world leader in nuclear innovation.”",
            "Minister for Nuclear & Networks Andrew Bowie said the programme “provides the blueprint for how the government can work together with industry to grow the economy and set the future of new, exciting nuclear technologies”.",
            "Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN CEO, said: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029. These companies will now be able to prepare for the next stages of the competition, aiming for a final contract agreement in the summer, potentially benefiting from significant support from the public purse.”",
            "The government’s objective has been to select technologies which offer the greatest confidence in being able to make a final investment decision in 2029 and be operational in the mid-2030s.",
            "For companies who were not successful in this initial process, the next opportunity could be the government’s consultation on alternative routes to market for nuclear technologies which is due to be launched soon. This will look at how to support newer technologies so that the UK can benefit from them as well.",
            "The government is set to consult later in the year on how best to ensure other nuclear technologies can potentially get underway in the UK – and this could include some of the technologies that were not selected through this process.",
            "The six technologies selected all depend to a large extent on traditional nuclear technology. The 470 MWe Rolls-Royce SMR design is based on a small pressurised water reactor. The design was accepted for UK Generic Design Assessment review in March 2022 and Rolls-Royce SMR expects to receive UK regulatory approval by mid-2024. A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium – which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI – expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.",

            "The company noted that the SMR will also be able to provide energy for the manufacture of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. It will occupy approximately one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear generation site, thereby reducing local ecological impacts. The SMR will be factory built, enabling completed modules to be transported by truck, train or barge, reducing vehicle movements and completion risk and increasing build time certainty.",

            "Singapore has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, prompting the exploration of low-carbon alternatives to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and to diversify its energy mix. Singapore currently derives 86% of its energy consumption from petroleum and other liquids, with natural gas accounting for 13%. However, it must import two-thirds of its crude oil and imports natural gas through pipelines as well as liquefied natural gas. This large amount of energy imports not only cause Singapore to lose a significant amount of foreign currency reserves but also poses a risk to the country’s energy security.",
            "Nuclear energy is not weather-dependent and requires relatively little fuel to generate a significant amount of power. Meanwhile, stockpiling of uranium for nuclear power is a viable solution in enhancing Singapore’s long-term energy security. The Energy 2050 Committee has therefore identified Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) as a viable option to decarbonise the power sector and increase energy security.",
            "Despite the potential benefits of nuclear energy for Singapore, establishing a nuclear plant in such a densely populated country poses a certain set of challenges and risks. The risks associated with nuclear energy are not solely technological but also sociological and environmental. Many conservationists remain opposed to its use due to concerns about the high risks it potentially poses to the population, the environment, and neighbouring countries. Risks include casualties and health risks due to radioactive exposure, security threats such as terrorist attacks, and environmental contamination. A comprehensive risk analysis provides insights into the risks and benefits of nuclear energy in a densely populated country, which can be used to make informed decisions about its use. It is crucial to thoroughly consider, assess, and evaluate all potential hazards before embarking on nuclear projects. This should be carried out by forming a team of trained experts, including scientists, engineers, and specialists from various fields to provide insights into nuclear energy technology, procedures, programmes, control measures, and risks, and act as advisors to the government on nuclear safety matters.",
            "Key factors for ensuring safe nuclear energy operation are strict governance, robust safety procedures, and effective measures. By combining these elements with the latest advancements in nuclear technology and plant design, the probability of nuclear accidents can be significantly reduced.",
            "Bowtie analysis of operating SMRs",
            "The operation of a nuclear power plant is associated with several hazards that can have serious consequences for public health and the environment. Natural hazards, such as earthquakes, severe weather, wildfires, and flooding, are well documented. Human errors in nuclear plant design, maintenance, and operation are also reported that can cause the failure of critical equipment. In addition, nuclear power plants are also vulnerable to intentional harm caused by sabotage, terrorism, and cyberattacks.",
            "The economic impact of a nuclear disaster can extend beyond the immediate area, causing damage to property, businesses, and investments and can have an impact on the health and well-being of neighbouring communities. This is particularly relevant for neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. Given the consequences, fear of a nuclear disaster can if not managed properly, lead to widespread scepticism of nuclear energy, which can have further societal and psychological effects.",
            "Based on the identified hazards and potential consequences, a qualitative bowtie diagram, Figure 1, provides a visual representation of the potential treats to a nuclear power plant, the potential consequences, and the suggested barriers to prevent or mitigate those consequences.",
            "Comparative analysis on reactor types",
            "To further enhance the broad-based control measures depicted in the bow-tie diagram, it is crucial to gather and thoroughly analyse data from past incidents. This process enables the identification of causes of such incidents, detection of patterns and trends, and development of effective solutions to mitigate the risks.",
            "The study aimed to identify the types of reactors that have contributed the most to nuclear accidents, as well as the common causes of safety system failures. However, the committee noted that such incidents primarily involved large conventional reactors and may not accurately reflect the safety risks associated with the SMRs which Singapore is considering. SMRs are gaining traction as a preferred option in the energy market due to their potential to provide flexible, affordable, and low-carbon energy. However, given their relatively recent emergence and unique design, there is currently limited data available on SMR nuclear accidents. To address this gap, this study relied on a database of nuclear events to expand the available information and develop sound recommendations for the Singapore government.",
            "According to the analysis, Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) were found to be the most common type of reactor involved in nuclear events, accounting for 784 (62%) out of 1,256 incidents, followed by Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) with 382 (30%) events. Further analysis revealed that the causes of nuclear events varied between them.",
            "According to this data, design residuals are the leading cause of nuclear events for both PWRs and BWRs. Therefore, it is important to consider inherently safer designs when setting up SMRs in Singapore, and foreseeable operational risks must be addressed during the design stage. To prevent operator errors, design verification and testing can be conducted to ensure that operations are robust and that systems can safeguard operations from operator error.",
            "While Singapore is unlikely to experience natural disasters such as earthquakes or tsunamis that could trigger a nuclear accident, tremors from earthquakes in neighbouring countries can occasionally be felt on the island. Thus, it is still recommended to design and build SMRs that can withstand tremors and other natural hazards to increase safety margins. This is also a requirement by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for all nuclear plants in the United States, following lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident.",
            "SMR retrofitting for Singapore",
            "To ensure the continued safety and reliability of nuclear facilities, as well as to gain valuable experience and test new technologies, the implementation of a pilot project to retrofit SMRs prior to the construction of full-scale nuclear facilities is recommended. By retrofitting SMRs with advanced safety features and monitoring systems, we can evaluate their performance in a controlled environment and make any necessary improvements before scaling up to larger facilities.",
            "SMRs require an Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) with a radius of less than 0.3 km. The existing power stations in Singapore are located in industrial areas away from densely populated residential areas. The approximate distances between the power stations and the densely populated areas show that any of the three power stations can be retrofitted with SMRs while maintaining a safe distance from densely populated areas. Using Hierarchical Clustering analysis, the Senoko Power Station has been identified as the most suitable candidate for the initial conversion, with the potential to retrofit the other two stations in the future.",
            "The selection of the Senoko Power Station as the primary candidate for SMR retrofitting is based on several factors, including its age of over 30 years and its reliance on oil that emits high levels of carbon dioxide. After a thorough evaluation of the power station’s various plants, the Hitachi 1983 Steam Thermal Plant, specifically either G7-243MW or G8-250MW, has been identified as the most suitable option for retrofitting with SMRs. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the retrofitted plant, it is recommended to use an Integrated Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) for the project. This type of land-based, water-cooled SMR has a power range of 151 MWe to 250 MWe and can be matched with either the G7-243MW or G8-250MW oil-based plant for a one-to-one retrofitting capacity. Several models, including NUWARD, W-SMR, or mPower, are suitable for this project.",
            "The retrofitting of SMRs may also present several construction and operational risks, which can be mitigated through the use of digital twin software and machine learning. The implementation of digital twin software and machine learning to simulate and evaluate the performance of SMRs will be an essential component of the SMR retrofitting process, allowing for thorough testing and optimisation of the technology prior to deployment. Digital twin models can help identify and prevent potential safety hazards, such as runaway reactions or loss of containment, by providing a virtual environment to test and optimize",
            "the technology. Machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning, can be utilised to ensure the safe operation of SMRs by detecting anomalies and predicting potential failures. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, can optimise maintenance and life cycle costing of all equipment by analysing patterns and identifying areas for improvement. Incorporating digital twin software and machine learning into the SMR retrofitting process can ensure the safe and efficient operation of these reactors. This approach will allow us to identify and resolve potential issues early on, minimising risk and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the facility.",

            "Another passive approach to nuclear safety is the use of in-vessel retention of the melted core, which can contain",
            "a core melt accident within the plant, thereby eliminating the need for evacuation measures for the surrounding",
            "area. This enables a smaller emergency planning zone to be established within the plant boundary. Additionally, the semi-buried (25m) underground nuclear configuration offers protection against potential acts of terrorism or malicious commercial plane crashes, as well as against the release of radioactive materials. This feature provides an added layer of protection against accidents and risks, ensuring the safety of the plant and the surrounding environment.",
            "Despite the safety measures put in place, accidents may still occur. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive on-site and off-site emergency response plan that can manage a credible nuclear plant emergency scenario in a highly populated country like Singapore. The plan must consider the challenges, limitations, and risks associated with the operation of a nuclear facility.",
            "An off-site emergency response plan is a particularly critical component for ensuring the safety of the population and the environment in the event of a nuclear incident in Singapore. The plant operator and local government must work together to ensure that the necessary measures are taken to safeguard the population from potential threats and hazards related to the plant’s operations. To ensure the success of an off-site emergency response plan for a nuclear plant operating in Singapore, it is also crucial to engage with the local community and provide them with the necessary information about the plant’s operation, safety measures, and emergency response plans.",
            "Managing a nuclear emergency in Singapore poses numerous challenges. Limited land space area makes it challenging to find a suitable evacuation site, while the high population density makes it difficult to safeguard the population. Limited resources and logistic issues, including a shortage of medical and emergency specialists and professionals, equipment, space, infrastructure, and supplies, further complicate responding to a nuclear emergency. Coordination and collaboration with local and neighbouring nations also present challenges, the different objectives and priorities of each party can lead to delays in establishing a unified approach, making the decision-making process difficult. Therefore, further research is necessary to address these challenges and develop effective strategies for managing a nuclear emergency in Singapore.",
            "The Singapore government is recommended to establish legal requirements related to nuclear safety, operations, and emergencies, and drive international nuclear research collaborations to exchange knowledge and experience in the nuclear safety field and gain access to nuclear facilities. The government should also nurture a nuclear workforce to meet future demands of the sector through a competency progression model and engage the public on nuclear energy through awareness campaigns, seek their feedback for better collaborations, and understanding for future sustainability of energy management.",
            "Next steps for nuclear Singapore",
            "To prepare for a full-fledged nuclear facility by 2050, this study recommends a pilot project to retrofit an SMR into an existing power station. The implementation of inherently safe Integral Pressurized Water Reactor (iPWR) SMR is highly recommended due to its ability to contain emergencies within the site boundaries, putting large-scale emergency evacuation concerns to rest.",
            "While the majority of past nuclear incidents may not be highly relevant in Singapore’s context, they do highlight the importance of establishing legal requirements related to nuclear safety, operations, and emergencies. This is necessary to ensure that Singapore is adequately prepared and equipped to respond to potential nuclear incidents. In addition, driving international nuclear research collaborations can facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience in the nuclear safety field, further enhancing the country’s preparedness and response capabilities.",
            "The Singapore government is also recommended to nurture a nuclear workforce to meet future demands of the sector through a competency progression model and engage the public on nuclear energy through awareness campaigns and feedback mechanisms for better collaboration and understanding towards the sustainable management of energy. A nuclear task force may work with the government to establish legal requirements, drive nuclear research collaborations, educate the public, and nurture a nuclear workforce.",
            "By implementing these recommendations, Singapore can move towards a more sustainable energy future with a safe and reliable nuclear power source.",

        "text": [
            "US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry, at the Three Seas Initiative Summit in Bucharest, announced US actions “to further the role of new, secure, and safe nuclear technologies in accelerating the clean energy transition”. The US State Department said in a statement. “These actions expand on Romania’s leadership role in building the first small modular reactor (SMR) in Europe and in converting a former coal plant to advance nuclear energy”. The Three Seas Initiative, launched in 2016, includes Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria, Estonia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania.",
            "Kerry also launched the Nuclear Expediting the Energy Transition (NEXT) One Stop Shop for SMR Support. This will provide countries in Europe and Eurasia that are approaching SMR deployment decisions access to the NEXT virtual centre where they can apply for a suite of advanced project preparation tools and services.",
            "These services may include in-person technical, financial, and regulatory consultancies and advisory services; expert study tours to visit US nuclear facilities, national laboratories, and universities; and competitively selected provision of an SMR simulator to support workforce development as a regional training hub. In addition, it will support “university-to-university partnerships for curricula development, faculty and graduate student and other educational exchanges to support the next generation of nuclear engineers, operators, and technicians who prioritise the highest international standards of nuclear security, safety, and non-proliferation”.",
            "Building on the launch of Project Phoenix at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Sharm El Sheikh (COP27) in 2022, Kerry also announced, in a side event, that project proposals from Czechia, Slovakia, and Poland had been competitively selected to participate in Project Phoenix and will receive support for coal-to-SMR feasibility studies. The side event took place at the University Politechnica of Bucharest and also featured the SMR simulator training centre that was installed earlier in 2023.",
            "Project Phoenix aims to support energy security and climate goals by creating pathways for coal-to-SMR power plant conversions while retaining local jobs through workforce retraining. The successful proposals will receive a share of $8m in US government support.",
            "One successful grant application, by a partnership including Slovak utility Slovenské elektrárne proposed five Slovak sites for consideration SMR feasibility studies: the Jaslovské Bohunice and Mochovce NPP sites; the Nováky and Vojany thermal power plant sites; and the site of the US Steel steel plant in eastern Slovakia. The feasibility study will assess several aspects and select the most suitable sites for the possible future construction of SMRs.",
            "Polish company Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE), which also received a grant, plans to use the funds to study a site at Ostrołęka. Ostrołęka is one of seven locations shortlisted by the company for further geological surveys to host SMR plants based on GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300, for which it holds the exclusive right in Poland.",
            "Kerry said the USA and the Government of Slovakia will co-host a Project Phoenix launch event, including a workshop with foreign partners in Bratislava in November. Project Phoenix supports energy security and climate goals by creating pathways for coal-to-SMR power plant conversions while retaining local jobs through workforce retraining.",
            "Project Phoenix and NEXT One Stop Shop are sub-programmes of the State Department’s Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme.",
            "During the Bucharest meeting, Kerry also said countries such as Romania and Bulgaria could use natural gas in their energy transition provided steps were made to capture emissions from new developments. \"In the conversations that I've had with the leaders in this region, they're very aware that if they're going to use fossil fuels, they have to capture the emissions,\" Kerry told Reuters.",
            "\"And gas can be part of the transition for sure, because gas is cleaner than coal, cleaner than oil. We have to make certain that we're able to capture the emissions.\" Kerry also said the UN climate change conference later this year, which will include work on a loss and damage fund for climate-hit states, needed to raise global ambitions on mitigation.",

            "Ikata Nuclear Power Plant. (Credit: Newsliner/Wikipedia)",
            "In recent months, nuclear power development in Asia has become the focus of growing attention. Globally, the number of nuclear reactors is increasing in Asia, while it is decreasing in Western Europe and North America. As the WNA notes: “Asia is the main region in the world where electricity generating capacity and specifically nuclear power are growing significantly. In Asia there are about 140 operable nuclear power reactors, about 30-35 under construction and firm plans to build an additional 40-50. Many more are proposed.”",
            "While this has been the trend for some time, it has accelerated in recent years, partly because of growing concerns about energy in general, following stringent Western sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. These considerations have, in some cases, even reversed the negative impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan, which saw a number of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan embark on nuclear-phase out policies.",
            "Another factor is the increasing number of small modular reactor (SMR) designs being offered to the market, encouraged by both private investment and government grants and awards. SMRs are being promoted as suitable for smaller countries that had hitherto ruled out standard NPPs as inappropriate or unaffordable.",
            "Asian countries with established nuclear power programmes or NPPs under construction include China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Bangladesh. Many others are now considering or reconsidering developing nuclear power, enticed by the promise of SMRs.",
            "In terms of operable nuclear power units, China leads Asia with 55~ ranking third worldwide. Next comes Japan with 33, but only 10 are currently operating. South Korea has 25, ranking fifth worldwide. India has 22, Pakistan six, Taiwan two and Bangladesh two under construction.",
            "China is largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western technology (from Canada, France and the US), which it is now exporting. Its 55 nuclear units at eight sites have a total capacity of 53,286 MWe. A further 23 units under construction at eight sites will add 24,296 MWe. In addition, some 45 units are planned totalling 50,110 MWe, with around 80 more firmly proposed.",
            "Three large state companies (and their subsidiaries) are responsible for NPP construction – China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and State Energy Investment Corporation (SPIC). The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are pressurised water reactors (PWRs), including the oldest unit, Qinshan 1, a 300 MWe Chinese-designed PWR, which started operating in 1991. Other technologies include pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs), high temperature gas cooled reactors (HTGRs) and fast neutron reactors (FNRs).",
            "Imported technologies include two Canadian Candu-6 PHWRs at Qinshan Phase III (Zhejiang province); French PWR M310 units at Daya Bay and Ling Ao and EPRs at Taishan (Guangdong province); Russian VVER-1000 and VVER-1200 PWRs at Tianwan (Jiangsu province) and Xudabao (Liaoning province); and US AP-1000 PWRs at Haiyang (Shandong province) and Sanmen (Zhejiang province).",
            "Indigenous development was based mainly on French M31 technology with CNNC and CGN producing slightly different versions: CNP1000, CNP600, CNP300, ACP300, ACP600, ACP1000 for CNNC; and CPR1000, M310+, ACPR1000 for CGN. The 1,000 MWe versions have now been integrated as the Hualong One (HPR1000). Three Hualong one units are already in operation in China with nine more under construction and others planned. China also adapted the US (Westinghouse) AP1000 under a technology transfer deal as the CAP1000 and CAP1400. Four CAP1000s are now under construction at sites originally planned for AP1000s.",
            "The Hualong One is China’s main export model. As yet, China has only exported NPPs to Pakistan, but the country also expects to finalise an agreement with Argentina. The UK cancelled plans for construction of a Hualong One at its Bradwell-on-Sea site largely for political reasons and China was also excluded from NPP tenders in the Czech Republic and Poland.",
            "China is also pushing ahead with SMRs and advanced reactors. CNNC’s SMR demonstration project at the Changjiang NPP (Hainan province) features the multi- purpose125 MWe ACP-100 (Linglong One) developed from the larger ACP1000 PWR. It is designed for electricity generation, urban heating and cooling, industrial steam production, or seawater desalination. Construction of the main internal structure for the reactor building has been completed. It was the first SMR project to pass an independent safety assessment by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts in 2016. In 2017, a joint venture was set up by China National Nuclear Power Co (part of CNNC) and four other domestic companies to develop and produce small, floating NPPs. Its remit was R&D, construction, operation & management and sales including possible exports.",
            "China is also building two demonstration pool-type sodium-cooled CFR-600 fast reactors in Xiapu county, Fujian province, as part of its plans to establish a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Construction of the first CFR-600 began in 2017 based on the China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) in Beijing. The CEFR was built with the assistance of Russia, which is supplying fuel for both the CEFR and CFR-600.",
            "Before the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan’s 54 reactors at 17 NPPs generated 30% of its power with plans to increase the share to 40%. All 54 were closed after the accident and new stringent safety standards were introduced by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in 2013. A total of 21 reactors were closed permanently, leaving 33 operable units totalling 31,679 MWe at 13 NPPs. As yet only 10 units (9,486 MWe) are in operation at six NPPs. Others are in the process of being reactivated or undergoing modifications to meet the new regulations with 16 awaiting regulatory approval to restart. Work stopped on two reactors that were under construction in 2011 (Shimane 3 and Ohma 1) and they are still facing delays. Japan’s NPPs all operate light water reactors (LWRs), the first of which were bought from US vendors such as General Electric and Westinghouse. Japanese companies were subcontracted to take part in construction and these were later licensed to build similar plants. Companies such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (MHI) developed the capacity to design and construct LWRs and by the late 1970s, Japan had established a domestic nuclear power industry. Currently it exports equipment worldwide and is also developing new reactor designs. MHI is designing an advanced 1200 MWe LWR (SRZ-1200) in cooperation with four EPCs (Kansai, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku.)",
            "Reactor restarts have been slower than expected. In 2022, nuclear only accounted for around 8% of electricity supply. The government’s Green Transformation (GX) strategic plan assumes that nuclear will account for 20–22% by 2030. Japan’s reactors include both PWRs, boiling water reactors (BWRs) and advanced BWRs (ABWRs). To date only PWRs have been restarted as BWRs require a filtered containment venting system, complicating the upgrades needed to meet the new regulations. Parliament recently endorsed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s policy to allow reactor operation beyond the 60-year limit set after Fukushima and to replace ageing facilities with next-generation advanced reactors.",
            "Japan had planned to use FNRs as part of a wider policy to expand the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel, with up to 18 reactors designated to use MOX. After Fukushima this was reduced to 12, only four of which are approved for operation, with three still awaiting approval to restart. Moreover, operation of the Monju FNR and Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s (JAEA’s) Joyo experimental FNR was impeded by a series of technical and political problems. This ultimately led to Monju’s closure but in May 2023, NRA said Joyo had met regulatory standards, and could restart.",
            "Japan is working closely with the USA on FNR development. JAEA, MHI, and Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR) recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US-based Terrapower to develop sodium-cooled fast reactor technology. This is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Design Demonstration Program (ARDP). MHI said Japan will accelerate innovations in various nuclear technologies through international collaboration on next-generation innovative reactors. Terrapower’s Natrium reactor is also being developed jointly with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy.",
            "In 2021, JAEA also resumed operation of its 30 MW experimental High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), closed for more than 10 years, after the HTGR was upgraded to meet the new regulatory requirements. JAEA is also co-operating with Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research to design a HTGR.",
            "Like China, South Korea is now largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western (mainly US) technology, which it is now exporting. Its 25 nuclear units at four sites have a total capacity of 24,489 MWe and account for around 27% of its electricity needs. Three more units under construction at two sites will add 4,020 MWe, with two units planned totalling 2,800 MWe.",
            "Most of South Korea’s nuclear units are LWRs apart from four Candu-6 PHWRs at its Wolsong NPP. South Korea’s first nuclear unit, Kori 1 (now closed), a Westinghouse unit built on a turnkey basis, began operation in 1978. Seven more were built in the 1980s based Westinghouse and Framatome technology including two involving Combustion Engineering (CE), which became part of Westinghouse. Korea’s ambitions to develop its own nuclear technology for export led to new reactor designs being developed. In 2005 the OPR- 1000 (Optimised Power Reactor) was launched with an eye to Asian markets. South Korea now has 10 operating OPR-1000 units and has since developed the Generation III APR-1400, three of which are in operation.",
            "Korea has an extensive nuclear R&D base and manufacturing capacity including state-owned Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Electric Power Co (Kepco) and subsidiary Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) as well as heavy engineering companies such as Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, and Doosan. These dominate the domestic market and are increasingly active globally.",
            "Projects include a variety of advanced reactors and SMRs, including the 330MWt System-Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART) reactor, which began development in 1997. In 2015 the SMART Power Company Ltd was launched supported by six supply chain companies to promote exports particularly to the Middle East and a co-operation agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia. Korea is also working on a sodium-cooled FNR in close co-operation with the US, and a HTGR for hydrogen generation.",
            "Korea is driven by considerations of energy security and the need to minimise dependence on imported fuels and technology. Kepco markets the OPR1000 and APR1400 globally. In 2009 the APR1400 was selected by the UAE for its four-unit Barakah NPP, now almost complete with three units already in operation ahead of schedule and within budget. Korea also won a contract in 2009 to supply a research reactor to Jordan, which was commissioned in 2016. In 2010 Korea announced plans to export 80 reactors by 2030, targeting 20% of the global market. It aimed to be 100% self-sufficient in nuclear technology by 2012, with no residual intellectual property constraints. US design certification for the APR1400 was finally approved in 2019 and in 2023 a new APR1000 design, specifically developed for the European market, was certified by the European Utility Requirements organisation. The success of the UAE project sparked interest worldwide and preliminary agreements were signed with several countries.",
            "Despite Fukushima, Korea announced plans in 2012 to increase nuclear’s share to 60% by 2035. However, in the face of growing public opposition, the government in 2013 drafted a reduced plan for a 29% nuclear share by 2035 and in 2017, the new government of President Moon Jae-in adopted a phase out plan. By the time this policy was reversed in 2023 by President Yoon Suk-yeol, the nuclear industry had lost a lot of ground. The new target was a 34.6% nuclear share by 2036, the export of 10 NPPs by 2030 and development of a Korean SMR design for export.",
            "Korea’s ties to the US have also complicated its nuclear development. The 1974 Korea-US Atomic Energy Agreement that limited raw material supply and banned uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing in Korea was extended for 20 years in 2015. Faced with pressure from Korea, the renewed agreement was framed more as a partnership, but it still contained restrictions. In May 2022 Korea joined the US-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme during a visit from US President Joe Biden’s visit to Korea to collaborate in promoting the global deployment of SMRs.",
            "However, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against KHNP after it signed an agreement with Polish private company ZE PAK to build an APR1400 at a former coal plant. This came after a tender to supply reactors for Poland’s nuclear power programme was awarded to Westinghouse. This also undermined Korea’s plans for possible exports to the Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit alleged intellectual property infringement by KHNP insisting on US government consent for export of the APR1400 claiming that it uses Westinghouse technology.",
            "India’s largely indigenous nuclear power programme is self- sufficient in reactor design and construction. Its 22 operable reactors at seven sites have a total capacity of 6,795 MWe, although three are currently suspended for repair leaving 19 operating units with a total capacity of 6,290 MWe. Eight more units under construction at four sites will add 6,028 MWe, with 12 further units planned. Nuclear currently accounts for around 1.5% of India’s installed power capacity. In April 2023 the government announced plans to increase nuclear capacity to 22,480 MWe by 2031, with nuclear accounting for nearly 9% of India’s electricity by 2047.",
            "The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are Indian designed PHWRs. Other technologies include India’s first power reactor, a Canadian supplied Candu at Rajasthan NPP, which started up in 1973 and closed in 2004; two BWRs built by GE on a turnkey contract at Tarapur NPP (currently suspended); and two VVERs (PWRs) at Kudankulam supplied by Russia. India is also building a 500 MWe FNR at Kalpakkam. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is responsible for construction and operation of India’s NPPs and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (Bhavini) is responsible for FNR development.",
            "Engineering companies, such as state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL), are key players in nuclear construction. The 1962 Atomic Energy Act prohibited private control of nuclear power generation. Amendments in 2016 only allow public sector joint ventures and direct foreign investment only in the supply chain and not in construction.",
            "India has a large and sophisticated nuclear R&D and manufacturing base, having launched its first research reactor, supplied by the UK, in 1957. Initially nuclear development was supported mainly by the UK, Canada, the US and France. However, after India’s nuclear bomb test in 1974, all support was withdrawn. The newly established Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), from which India was excluded, prevented India from importing any nuclear technology or fuel, setting it on a path of independent nuclear development.",
            "With limited uranium resources, India embarked on a three-stage programme aimed at using its abundant thorium resources based on an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle. Stage 1 would use PHWRs and LWRs. Plutonium from these would fuel the fast reactors planned for Stage 2. Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) in Stage 3 would burn thorium-plutonium fuels in a self- sustaining fuel cycle. An alternative end stage could be molten salt breeder reactors (MSBRs).",
            "India immediately embarked on construction of small PHWRs and by 2008, 12 200-220 MWe units were in operation at five sites, as well as two 540 MWe units at Tarapur NPP.",
            "In 2002 the regulatory authority approved construction of a 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, which is now nearing completion, while research is underway on molten salt reactors (MSRs).",
            "Only Russia continued cooperation based on a 1988 agreement that pre-dated the NSG, and in 2002 began construction of two VVER-1000 units at the Kudankulam NPP. Then, in 2005, India signed a civil nuclear agreement with the US, leading in 2008 to an NSG waiver for India, despite its not signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). This enabled nuclear trade to resume but negotiations to include India as a full NSG member have so far stalled on Chinese opposition. Nevertheless, the waiver enabled India to sign nuclear cooperation agreements with numerous countries and to start discussions with the US, France, Japan and South Korea on possible construction.",
            "However, India’s nuclear liability regime impeded progress. Following the 1984 Bhopal disaster India passed a law, making equipment suppliers responsible for any future accident. Amendments in 2010 made plant operators primarily liable but still allowed possible recourse to suppliers. A compromise was reached with Russia, which continued construction at Kudankulam, where two units are now operating with two more under construction and others planned. Other suppliers remained hesitant. While projects were agreed with France for six EPRs at Jaitapur and with the US for six AP1000s at Kovvada, they have not been finalised. India, meanwhile, embarked on a programme to build larger 700 MWe PHWRs, the first of which began operating at the Kakrapar NPP (unit 3) in 2021, with plans for 10 more.",
            "Pakistan has six operable reactors at two sites supplied on a turnkey basis by China, with a total capacity of 3,262 MWe. Four CNP-300 reactors (300-315 MWe) at the Chasma NPP site began operation between 2011 and 2017. In June 2023, Pakistan and China signed an agreement for construction of a 1,100 MWe Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor for Chasma 5. Unit 1 at the Karachi NPP site, a 137 MWe Candu supplied by Canada that began operation in 1971 and closed in 2021 was the first nuclear power unit in Asia. The site also hosts two Chinese supplied 1,017 MWe Hualong One units that began operation in 2021 and 2022. Over the coming decade Pakistan plans to expand its nuclear power generating capacity to 8,800 MWe.",
            "Pakistan has a significant R&D base but much of it is linked to the military programme. The Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology (Pinstech) at Rawalpindi with a US-supplied research reactor focuses on civil research and is under IAEA safeguards. Other facilities in Rawalpindi and Khushab continue to support weapons development.",
            "Like India, Pakistan is excluded from the NSG. However, all its power units are under IAEA safeguards and IAEA oversight and support is ongoing. In 2018 four IAEA national technical cooperation projects were amalgamated into a single project, PAK2007, “Strengthening and Enhancing Capabilities of Pakistan’s National Institutions to Support a Safe, Reliable & Sustainable Nuclear Power Programme”. This aims to streamline workflows, reduce delays and costs, enhance cooperation and harmonise safety and waste management approaches.",
            "Two of Taiwan’s three US-supplied two-unit NPPs (Chinshan, Kuosheng and Maanshan) have now been closed in line with a nuclear phase-out law adopted in 2016. A fourth NPP under construction, Lungmen, was cancelled. Taiwan’s six operable power reactors are to be decommissioned as their 40-year operating licences expire. Chinshan 1, Taiwan’s oldest plant, closed in 2018, followed by Chinshan 2 in 2019. These 600 MWe General Electric (GE) Mark I BWRs began operation in 1978 and 1979. Kuosheng 1&2, 985 MWe GE Mark III BWRs, which began operation in 1981 and 1983, were closed in 2021 and 2023. Construction of Lungmen 1&2 (both GE 1350 MWe ABWR units) began in 1999. Lungmen 1 was completed but mothballed in 2015, and construction of Lungmen 2 was suspended in 2014.",
            "Taiwan now has two operable nuclear units at the Maanshan plant, both Westinghouse 936 MWe PWRs, whose operating licences expire in 2024 and 2025. Owner-operator Taipower also operates coal power plants, which are to be replaced by natural gas turbines. Taiwan’s first deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are expected in 2023. While there is strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Taiwan, the opposition Kuomintang Party, which is expected to win the forthcoming elections, opposed the nuclear phase out.",
            "While early nuclear development in Asia was largely influenced by regional rivalries, today it is the focus of a global power struggle between China and the US. India has so far largely avoided involvement in this geopolitical game. Pakistan’s close ties with China are evident, as are South Korea’s and Japan’s ties with the US. China would clearly like to increase exports of its Hualong One and also SMRs, including floating NPPs, and is increasingly becoming a competitive vendor. There are numerous other runners and riders looking to embrace nuclear power, especially with the emergence of smaller modular reactors that are more appropriate in places where a full-sized NPP might be more challenging to justify. Longer term, it seems likely that Asia will continue to expand both its nuclear capacity and capabilities.",

            "The UAE’s Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) and Poland’s Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to co-operate in the development small modular reactors (SMRs). The MOU aims to provide an enabling framework for developing SMRs based on GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMR technology in Poland and the UK, as well as within Central and Eastern Europe. ENEC and OSGE will work together to identify specific areas of mutual cooperation.",
            "ENEC will share the experience learned from the development of the Barakah Plant, its experience in building operational readiness, and stakeholder management, including building commercial frameworks with technology vendors and other contractors. OSGE seeks to build a nuclear organization that can meet energy sector challenges, by the increased use of advanced nuclear technologies, such as fourth generation SMRs.",
            "The agreement was signed by ENEC Managing Director & CEO Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi and OSGE CEO Rafał Kasprów, during the World Nuclear Symposium 2023 in London. Al Hammadi said the MOU “sets the stage for our plans to accelerate nuclear adoption globally and lend our expertise in advancing the clean energy transition towards achieving Net Zero”. He added that development of the Barakah NPP in the UAE “is a catalyst for innovation and R&D in new areas, including SMRs which, we are currently exploring as part of our future growth opportunities, alongside other next-generation technologies”.",
            "Kasprów said partnership with ENEC was a milestone for OSGE. “ENEC brings unique experience in building nuclear power plants in accordance with the highest nuclear industry safety and quality standards, delivering projects on time and on budget. Furthermore, I am pleased that ENEC recognises the development of SMR’s as important for the future of nuclear energy. I truly believe that thanks to this cooperation, we are taking a significant step forward in the development of SMR’s worldwide.\"",
            "Construction of the UAE’s Barakah NPP began in 2011. Korea Electric Power Company (Kepco) led the consortium that is building the plant comprising four APR1400 reactors. Unit 1 was connected to the grid in 2020, followed by unit 2 in 2021. Unit 1 began commercial operation in April 2021 and unit 2 in March 2022. Unit 3 was connected to the grid in October 2022 and unit 4 completed hot functional testing in July 2022 in preparation for commercial operation. Once all four units are operating, they will contribute up to 25% of the UAE's National Determined Contributions to Net Zero and be the largest source of dispatchable clean electricity.",
            "OSGE aims to play an important role in Poland’s decarbonisation plans and seeks to deploy the first SMR in Poland before the end of the decade, with subsequent units planned for the 2030s. OSGE as a partner of GE-Hitachi, has exclusive rights to deploy BWRX-300 technology in Poland. OSGE is also collaborating with Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and the US Tennessee Authority Valley (TVA), both of which have also selected BWRX-300 technology.",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s ESBWR which has US Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification. As a result of design simplification, GEH claims the BWRX-300 will require significantly less capital cost per MW compared with other SMR designs. GEH says the BWRX-300 is being designed to reduce construction and operating costs below other nuclear power generation technologies. It will leverage a combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components as well as a design based on an already licensed reactor.",
            "OSGE said the example set by the UAE and ENEC's investment in Barakah proves that by selecting the right partners and relying on the knowledge and skills of highly specialised staff, a nuclear project can be successfully completed. ENEC's experience will be an important element supporting the development of OSGE’s SMR project. ENEC will share the lessons learned from the construction and development of the Barakah power plant and its achievements in creating operational readiness, managing contacts and communication with stakeholders, including building commercial agreements with technology suppliers and other contractors.",

Terrapower says the contracts will help to establish key elements of the supply chain that the advanced reactor industry will require as new reactors are brought to market.",
            "TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are developing the Natrium technology, which features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. According to Terrapower, this “allows a Natrium plant to integrate seamlessly with renewable resources and leads to faster, more cost-effective decarbonisation of the electric grid while producing dispatchable carbon-free energy”.",

        "text": [
            "Above: Nuclear power is central to meeting our low-carbon energy needs",
            "“Traditional nuclear is all about the cost overruns and the regulatory regime. It’s a risk problem,” explains Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at Charles River Associates Energy Practice. Considering the need for new nuclear capacity, the emerging roll out of small modular and advanced reactor technologies and the market for private investment those risks remain but given its early stage there are a lot of additional technology risks too. Addressing those risks is vital if nuclear is to attract investment and go on to meet its potential. It’s vital for us too given that nuclear is central if the world is to meet its emissions reduction targets.",
            "“We’ve been working with utilities to think about that question of how do they invest in nuclear, what role do they play and how do they de-risk a project? One idea is this approach of having a champion that can make a market. It could be a developer but more likely it’s going to be either a large utility or an off taker that’s a sizeable off taker,” says Kotak.",
            "She cites recent moves by Dow and X-energy to advance efforts to deploy advanced small modular nuclear reactors at an industrial site under the US DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. In March, Dow and X-energy signed a joint development agreement to develop a four-unit Xe-100 facility at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites. However, while energy-hungry commercial enterprise is clearly a suitable candidate to champion SMRs and advanced reactors, other interests also have a role to play. “You see governments and utilities playing a bigger role in that de-risking process. That could be around the technology, it could be around having the right off-take agreement in place, it could be about having the licensing process streamlined, things of that nature,” says Kotak. She refers to places like Poland, the Czech Republic and Canada where governments are stepping in to support development of advanced reactor technologies. However, when considering SMRs and advanced reactors one element of the technology risk concerns the multitude of different designs that are currently being mooted. “There are over 80 different technologies being bandied about. Some of them won’t make it past the design stage and some will go all the way through and become major businesses. It’s understanding which ones will make it through which ones won’t,” adds Kotak.",
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has deployed a Small Modular Reactor dashboard which includes an analysis of 21 SMR designs and the progress towards their deployment and commercialisation. The dashboard looks beyond technology readiness level and assesses progress across six additional conditions including licensing readiness, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel. CRA offers a similar readiness dashboard, the S mark, which also supports de-risking of SMRs and advanced reactor technologies. “We looked at the full spectrum of risk from technology to supply chain to licensing to TRLs and so forth and we filter down to the top 15 or 20 technologies that are the most promising across the world in terms of an investment perspective,” explains Kotak.",
            "Taking a lead on investment",
            "While external influences like government and industry clearly have a major role to play in de-risking investment, Kotak argues that the industry itself can do more too. “Looking generally across the nuclear sector we think the different players within the industry can have their own role to attract more investment. Looking from an operator perspective, they have a lot of experience in traditional nuclear but they can leverage those learnings across other nuclear technologies even though there are different construction timelines, and different sorts of risks associated with advanced reactors there are also a lot of synergies. That reduces those risks up front, mitigating the construction risk for example or lessening the construction time, which of course is more palatable from an investment perspective.”",
            "Furthermore, Kotak says, operators can also optimise their existing customer relationships by identifying those that could benefit from, for example, process heat on existing sites: “Thinking slightly outside the box can move forward the discussion on how investment can be attracted by reducing those upfront costs and risks which traditionally have been the stumbling blocks to getting investment.”",
            "“I think that’s really the how this champion concept is a future way of being able to de-risk but also attract more investment because it enables the OEM, such as GE Hitachi, to have that operator-developer-customer lens all in one. Knowing what those connection points are is how a lot of the problems that we’re seeing with large-scale capital and infrastructure intensive projects is howe the process can be simplified to reduce cost,” she adds.",
            "Kotak also references the role of the government in supporting additional investment: “The final player that we see within the nuclear sector and having a known role in attracting more investment would be government bodies.”",
            "However, even where governments are encouraging investment some reform is needed to ensure that technologies and designs can not only keep up with the pace that’s needed for nuclear to remain a key part of the transition, but also for investors to recognise that there is state or central government backing and that their investment in that is also considered.",
            "“That’s something that we have seen work well in countries where private investment has been stimulated because of central government backing and funding, for example with Poland and its nascent nuclear market. They’ve got a lot of private investment now because of government steps to reduce the complexity of regulation, enable commercial frameworks, sign binding relationships with established players. Looking at it from the regulatory perspective is also helpful when thinking about how we can encourage more investment. The current regulatory process is very drawn out and it’s not conducive to attracting investment,” says Kotak.",
            "Furthermore, Kotak contends that there is ample evidence of an industry champion being key to a successful investment and development strategy for nuclear. “When we look at the success stories it really is where you see these partnerships and champions. In Canada, GE HItachi are closely working with OPG and the government, almost as a partner rather than a vendor, which you also see a lot in the US. Some of the troubles that some of the developers are having is because they’re on their own in some ways. They’re fighting the government and the off takers over costs and things of that nature, rather than working together,” says Kotak, adding: “Launching new technology, the vendor has traditionally taken on a lot of the risk of early units in close partnership with the customer and the off-taker to make those projects happen.”",
            "Getting government on board",
            "A major investment risk for nuclear projects is the regulatory environment. As Kotak says: “Nuclear faces so much more scrutiny than any other technology. These regulatory processes are looking for 100% safety and that’s not just very costly, but adds complexity because if one government asks for one thing, another government will ask for that thing plus something else. So instead of having standard requirements when you have more than one regulatory agency in the picture it is actually worse because then you have the worst of both.”",
            "She argues that having government investment, not necessarily in terms of money, but in terms of leadership, is key to addressing those kinds of investor concerns:",
            "“If we think about the three buckets of risk in construction, having more than a verbal promise and an actual investment mitigates that first step in terms of the design development and the licensing. Certification is part of the process that isn’t actually anything to do with the commercialisation or the deployment of the reactor. It actually distracts from what is needed and I think it’s getting it to the point where they [governments] have a stake in the ground as well. if we are going to actually see nuclear getting to the heights that it has the potential to, these localised regulatory hurdles do need to be mitigated and perhaps there is some benefit in looking at how other industries have been able to do that, like aviation. Leveraging learnings from other industries that might deal with some of the same complexities or risks and are also global is another way of looking at how players can actually progress and not impede progress,” says Kotak.",
            "A strong message for governments looking at expanding nuclear capacity would be to deliver the same regulatory coherence which exists in aviation and which is conspicuously missing from the advanced and SMR sector. “There’s probably some technology consolidation that needs to take place too,” notes Kotek. “There’s just too many different designs and that adds complexity too. The regulator has to examine 80 different technologies and they all have different approaches. This is a nightmare and having fewer technologies is probably something that’s going to need to take place as well.”",
            "“In the beginning of the nuclear build out people talked about electricity being too cheap to meter. They said that because it was actually really cheap,” says Kotek. Certainly there are ractors built in the 1970s and 1980s that are still running and for a fraction of the cost of just about any other form of electricity generation that is available today.",
            "Kotek continues: “They’re really reliable, safe and they’ve been running for 50 years or more. We somehow lost track of that and the rise of all the clean energy sources like wind and solar have now created a stronghold. Actually though, when you look at the sustainability advantage of nuclear it is more favourable, yet we’ve added in these complexities and these layerings that are inhibiting its development. We are not only making it more expensive but actually we’re missing out some key sustainability advantages as well,” says Kotek.",
            "Nonetheless, considering what is actually required to meet the 2°C scenario from the Paris agreement, the amount of solar, wind, batteries and EVs and the associated nickel, copper and lithium materials that are needed and all the mines that need to be developed too it is clear that nuclear must be part fo the solution.",
            "“If you look at where things are today and where they need to be in 10 years we’re just nowhere near. So there’s going to be a reckoning at some point. Nuclear is potentially a backfill for some of the challenges that we’re going to see in the medium term on the renewables front. We haven’t really hit it yet but we’re starting to feel it in the EV world where the battery supply chain issues are real and it’s around the materials supply chain.",
            "There is going to be a more pressing overall drive for alternative technologies and we really mean nuclear if we mean low carbon,” says Kotek. She adds: “It’s not to pit nuclear against renewables. It’s more that renewables may not be able to get there in time because of the mining issues. Again, it’s a risk management issue given the obvious resource risk for renewables. If you were an investor and considered the technical risk of choosing one technology over another maybe they’re not considering there are other perhaps pressing risks that are associated with other technologies,” says Kotek.",
            "Considering the complexity and the sheer volume of different technologies it’s very difficult to unpack all the issues and to see across the value chain where the pain points are. However, Kotek argues that a lot of activity in the small and advanced nuclear sector reflects this realisation that nuclear is going to be needed to transition to a low carbon energy scenario. “My personal view is that nuclear has to play a part and there’s no way around it,” she says.",
            "Turning to the messaging for investors about how to address some of these risks, she emphasises the commercial risks and ways to mitigate those risks by, for example, having a champion who would partner with developers to provide a ready market but also work with them in the development process and ease that process to reduce the construction development risks, but she also highlights the role that investors themselves can play: “This is all from the perspective of what investors need to feel more comfortable with making a large investment in nuclear. But investors can also have a voice to rally behind these points. A lot of trends that we were starting to see are because of the Russia-Ukraine war in terms of increased policy support like the US Inflation Reduction Act. So, the foundations are there for investment and now maybe it’s also on the investors to say what do they need to be able to make a comfortable decision. They need that de-risk and more of these tangible measures like having the regulatory licensing process paid for, but I think it’s also a point for them as well to shout a little bit as to what is needed to de-risk.”",
            "Her key message: “An advanced nuclear rollout is not a ‘nice to have’ it’s a ‘must-have’ if we’re going to have an energy transition that works in any time line that makes sense for climate. There’s a real need for this and investors should think about that and ultimately how the scale of this is going to increase.”"

            "Framatome said the EATF fuel assembly “builds on previous work that included completing 18- and 12-month fuel cycle tests on lead fuel rods in the US and Switzerland respectively. The PROtect EATF chromium-coated cladding and chromia-enhanced pellets are more tolerant to changes in reactor core temperatures, increasing coping time while reducing corrosion and the production of hydrogen under high-temperature conditions.",
            "The LFA was fabricated at Framatome’s manufacturing facility in Richland, Washington, as part of a 2019 contract with Exelon that marked the fourth different reactor type to implement PROtect EATF technologies.",
            "Earlier in July, Framatome signed a collaboration agreement with EDF to begin reactor tests of its (EATF technology at a French NPP. Framatome will manufacture and deliver four lead fuel assemblies (LFAs) that will be inserted in one of the EDF’s reactors later this year.

The system features a 345 MWe reactor and can be optimised for specific markets. Its thermal storage has the potential to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe of power for more than five and a half hours when needed. This allows for a nuclear design that follows daily electric load changes and helps customers capitalise on peaking opportunities driven by renewable energy fluctuations. As more renewables are integrated into the grid, the demand for gigawatt-hour-scale energy storage will continue to increase.",
            "In October 2022, Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas (GNF-A), a GE-led joint venture, and TerraPower agreed to build a Natrium Fuel Facility at the site of GNF-A’s existing plant site near Wilmington. The Natrium Fuel Facility will be jointly funded by TerraPower and DOE through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which aims to speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with US industry. The Natrium Fuel Facility will use HALEU. The US Energy Act of 2020 authorised DOE to support availability of HALEU for domestic commercial use.",
            "Under the new MoU, Centrus and TerraPower will collaborate to ensure the Natrium demonstration reactor has access to HALEU at the milestones necessary to meet the project’s 2030 operation date. The two companies said they will establish a cost-competitive and timely source of enrichment capacity in the US at Centrus’s HALEU production facility. TerraPower and Centrus have been working together since 2021 when they entered into a contract for services to help expedite the commercialisation of domestic enrichment technology at Centrus’s Piketon, Ohio, facility.",
            "“TerraPower is committed to a successful and timely delivery of the Natrium demonstration reactor,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower president and CEO. “This expanded collaboration with Centrus represents TerraPower’s commitment to reinvigorating the domestic supply chain as we bring advanced reactors to market within the decade. Generation IV reactors are the solution we need for the energy grid of the future and this MoU will ensure we can fuel these reactors for decades to come.”",
            "“Centrus is ready to pioneer US HALEU production and to meet the needs of TerraPower in bringing their advanced reactor to market,” said Centrus President & CEO Daniel B Poneman. “American HALEU production is vital for deploying US-designed advanced nuclear reactors. Establishing the domestic HALEU supply chain is critical for our energy independence.”",
            "In February, Centrus completed the operational readiness review for its HALEU production facility and in June received permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to begin operation. Under the MoU, Centrus will work toward scaling up production capacity with additional centrifuge cascades to meet TerraPower’s fuel requirements.",
            "TerraPower plans a demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer in Wyoming to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of its Kemmerer reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied HALEU. The conflict in Ukraine, however, made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely.",

The CNSC issued a positive decision in March, making the BWRX-300 the first SMR to complete such a pre-licensing Vendor Design Review in Canada. Subject to Ontario Government and CNSC regulatory approvals on construction, the additional SMRs could come online between 2034 and 2036.",
            "This timing would allow OPG to apply learnings from the construction of the first unit to deliver cost savings on subsequent units, the government noted. Building multiple units will also allow common infrastructure such as cooling water intake, transmission connection and control room to be utilised by all four units instead of just one, reducing costs even further.",
            "\"Once deployed, these four units would produce a total 1200 megawatts of electricity, equivalent to powering 1.2 million homes, helping to meet increasing demand from electrification and fuel the province's strong economic growth,\" the government noted.",

These components will be welded into sub-assemblies and shipped to the DNNP project site, where they will be built into larger modules on-site and used to construct the primary steel structure of the reactor building. Leveraging a modular approach to help build the BWRX-300 SMR is expected to reduce construction costs.",

            "Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) – a joint venture between chemical producers Synthos Green Energy (SGE) and PKN Orlen – applied to the PAA for an assessment in July 2022. The opinion aims to determine whether the planned organisational and technical solutions comply with the requirements of nuclear safety and radiological protection resulting from the provisions of the country's Atomic Law Act, or whether the investor should make appropriate modifications. OSGE submitted documentation covering 13 areas of the BWRX-300 technology.",
            "According to the PAA, a general opinion, \"as a pre-licence instrument, may apply to any solutions planned by the investor, including design, technological and organisational solutions, which will have a direct impact on the issues of nuclear safety and radiological protection\".",
            "PAA analysed various aspects of the BWRX-300 technology including hazard identification and reactor protection against internal and external hazards, requirements for the reactor control room, safety containment systems and classification of safety systems, reactor core design requirements and electrical systems. Solutions for control and measurement apparatus, waste and nuclear fuel management systems were also analysed.",
            "The technical documentation submitted by OSGE was based on documentation prepared by GEH for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) as part of the Vendor Design Review Phase 1 and Phase 2 process – a pre-licence technology review. The BWRX-300 became the first SMR to complete such a process in Canada when CNSC issued a positive decision in March.",
            "Despite the positive opinion, the PAA president identified one technical assumption of the BWRX-300 reactor technology, which needs to be re-verified before starting the proper administrative process related to obtaining permits. OSGE CEO Rafał Kasprów, nevertheless, said the general opinion “is an important first step on the road of licensing works necessary for the construction of GEH's modular nuclear power plants in Poland”. He added: \"It should be noted that following the technical collaboration agreement signed in Washington in March this year, a complete power plant design based on the BWRX-300 technology – including a nuclear island – is being developed in the US. The project will take into account all regulatory requirements and technical standards required by Polish law.\"",
            "Sean Sexstone, executive vice president of advanced nuclear at GEH said the BWRX-300 “is the first SMR technology to have completed the general opinion phase of the PAA's rigorous pre-licensing process, an important step in the deployment of this technology in conjunction with OSGE”.

        "text": [
            "The small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses. (Credit: Wim van ‘t Einde on Unsplash)",
            "The nuclear industry hopes that small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses of the energy system; supplied as a package, delivered in modules that can be quickly and easily assembled on-site and providing heat or power to neighbouring customers or to the grid as a whole.",
            "In theory, using a small modular technology that is quickly rolled out in numbers allows the supply chain to make efficiencies, builds operating experience for owners and investors alike and drives the technology down the “cost curve”. That process has become familiar in the energy industry as wind turbines, solar PV and batteries have been rolled out in numbers that have risen from a few hundred units to become a mainstay of the energy industry in less than two decades. In fact the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted in its March report that between 2010 and 2019 “sustained decreases” saw unit costs fall by 85% for solar PV, by 55% for wind power and by 85% for lithium ion batteries. That came with deployment at the end of the period 10 times that at the start for solar PV.",
            "Can nuclear SMRs follow the same route? Or has the industry’s current scattergun approach limited its opportunity to follow other clean energy technologies down the cost curve?",
            "There are several consistent aspects to technologies that have successfully negotiated the curve. They are (initially) small; a single familiar technology has been used; it has been rolled out in numbers; they can be accommodated on a variety of sites; experience of the first projects has been quickly absorbed; and that data has given third party financiers confidence to invest in follow-on projects. Lithium ion batteries, for example, are being rolled out at gigawatt scale, yet the largest installations, housed in facilities very like shipping containers, contain arrays of familiar small batteries. Innovation has been required in operating them as a mass array, integrating them with the grid, developing markets for the services they can offer (response, rather than baseload power) and modelling and managing the best operating regimes. Now there is ‘market pull’ as electricity system operators value the services they can provide.",
            "SMRs are still at the ‘market push’ stage. The International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) says it is aware of more than 80 designs that have been mooted, but its Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS) lists 48 reactor designs in the SMR category that are at some point in the design phase. In fact, nearly a dozen of those actually fall outside IAEA’s own SMR definition, which puts an upper limit of 300 MWe on the reactor rating and the 300 MWe designation also means some of the more elderly conventional designs, such as India’s PHWR, are included in IAEA SMR listings.",
            "The IAEA’s ARIS list has seven distinct types of technology at an early or late stage of design, with designs varying within each class. A dozen are versions of light water reactors that might be considered closest to the PWRs and BWRs that currently form the majority of working reactors. Seven are based around lead coolant, nine around sodium coolant and five around lead bismuth coolant. Six have helium coolant and five are based around fluoride and graphite. Two combine a graphite moderator with a molten salt coolant.",
            "Reducing costs by replication requires ‘learning by doing’ – ie building the reactors. That requires several issues to fall into place: a well-understood design, ideally with an operating track record, and a pipeline of sites that gives the supply chain confidence to invest. Where has the SMR industry reached in that process?",
            "An SMR barrier that is not faced by many other types of electricity generation is the nuclear licence. This requires both a licence for the technology and for the site and it is a bottleneck that each technology has to pass through. The first to do so was NuScale, which won design approval for the six-module VOYGR variant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January this year. However, design approval for the technology does not necessarily mean it can be installed at a chosen site. The US NRC approval for NuScale allows a utility or other operator to reference the design, but the operator has still has to apply for a combined licence to build and operate it as a nuclear power plant anywhere in the USA.",
            "Likely to be the next to receive design approval is the GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which “leverages the design and licensing basis” of GEH’s US NRC-certified ESBWR. It was entered into the US NRC licensing process in 2020. BWRX-300 has already completed phases one and two of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s (CNSC) vendor design review process and in December 2022 GEH announced that it has submitted it into the UK’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA).",
            "The UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) also last year took on GDA of a new reactor from the UK’s Rolls Royce SMR. The reactor is described as an SMR by the company, although at 440 MWe it is considerably above the IAEA’s upper limit to meet that definition.",
            "All three of these designs are based on well-known nuclear technology that has been deployed and has a track record of operation. Although the SMR version has numerous differences, these designs are likely to have the familiarity needed for mass rollout.",
            "What has been the progress towards choosing sites for the potential SMR fleet?",
            "In contrast to large nuclear units, which are necessarily much more influenced by site characteristics, the key requirement for SMRs is replication. That means the site should be able to host several units or there should be a large number of potential sites available. It is no surprise that the technologies that have passed furthest through the design licensing process have a head start when naming sites for deployment.",
            "NuScale’s progress through the licensing process has given it a strong position in raising potential buyer interest. It is selling its 77 MWe NuScale plant in three, six or 12 unit versions branded as ‘VOYGRTM’ and it is working with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) on a combined licence application for a six-module plant to be sited at the Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "The application will be submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) next year and is targeting units to start up in 2029 and 2030. The UAMPS consortium recently reapproved the project despite cost increases. UAMPS said a new budget plan “will move the small modular nuclear reactor project into an aggressive 2023 workplan, which focuses on completing the preparation of the application to construct and operate the plant, to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 2024.” This year it will also procure long lead material – NuScale Power has already placed an upper reactor pressure vessel order with Doosan Enerbility – and will develop a more detailed construction estimate.",
            "NuScale has signed agreements with two other utilities that could open the door to more deployment. They are via Dairyland Power (which serves Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois) and Associated Electric Cooperative Inc (which serves 2 million people in Missouri).",
            "In addition, NuScale Power has also unveiled a large number of Memoranda of Understanding with potential site owners in other countries. The most advanced is Romania’s RoPower Nuclear, which is owned equally by S.N. Nuclearelectrica and Nova Power & Gas, and which signed a contract with NuScale Power for front-end engineering and design (FEED) work in December. Phase 1 of the FEED work awarded to NuScale will define the major site and specific inputs for a VOYGR-6 plant to be deployed at the Doicesti power station. Importantly, Doicesti was not previously a nuclear site and instead has small coal-fired generation units.",
            "Similarly, in Poland, NuScale now has agreements with companies in which it is providing ‘support’ as they investigate deploying VOYGR at sites that have not hosted nuclear technology in the past. One is a joint venture of Unimot (which offers Polish wholesale and retail customers fuel products, gas and electricity) and Getka (a US energy company) and the other is KGHM, a Polish metals extraction company and a large industrial energy user. KGHM has already begun discussions with the National Atomic Energy Agency (NAEA) and has signed an early works agreement with NuScale.",
            "NuScale can also point to Memoranda of Understanding in Europe with Bulgaria, Ukraine and Czechia. Outside Europe it has similar agreements in Jordan and Kazakhstan. All, of course, require the reactor to be licensed.",
            "Also securing potential customers is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMR. It secured its first site last year when Ontario Power Generation selected it for deployment at Darlington. OPG aims to complete the first commercial construction at the site in 2028. Notably, GEH has signed project delivery agreements with SNC-Lavalin and Aecon for that project. Design acceptance by CNSC will give a head start for a second deployment by SaskPower which has selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan, although that is timed for the mid-2030s.",
            "This year GEH also announced that Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has begun planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site in Tennessee.",
            "The regulatory approval process has been kicked off in Poland, where Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners have submitted an application to Poland’s National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE says it wants to deploy “at least 10” BWRX-300s with the first in operation by the end of this decade. In addition, Fermi Energia announced that it had selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Estonia.",
            "Rolls Royce has not yet secured a site in its home market for its SMR. It believes the reactor will be of interest for so-called ‘industrial clusters’, areas which the UK has given a particular focus for decarbonisation. Government funding for the industrial clusters has been directed towards development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen production, rather than opening the sites for new nuclear. The new nuclear option is currently restricted to specific sites in England and Wales (Scotland has a moratorium on new nuclear) identified when the government decided to restart nuclear build 20 years ago. In the end the sites identified were previous nuclear sites. Planning law reform currently under way should widen that pool of sites but, currently, industrial sites would require special permission from government. However, Rolls Royce has also found willing partners in Poland. The state- owned Industria business, a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Agency JSC, has selected the Rolls-Royce SMR for the Central Hydrogen Cluster, with plans to produce 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen each year. It wants up to three units and Rolls-Royce SMR said that may open the door to “opportunities to replace more than 8 GW of coal-fired power plants in southern Poland with SMRs throughout the 2030s”.",
            "NuScale, GEH and Rolls Royce have sought design approval first and built customer numbers as the reactor advances through the process. But X-Energy may undertake the process in partnership.",
            "X-Energy is part of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) and will receive $1.2bn in cost shared funding from DOE over the life of the ARDP effort. Now it has signed a joint development agreement (JDA) with US chemicals conglomerate Dow to use X-Energy’s Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactor for process heat and electricity. The JDA scope includes the preparation and submission of a Construction Permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). X-energy is said to be preparing to submit a license application to the NRC.",
            "They plan to build X-Energy’s first unit at a Dow industrial site – one of several the company has along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Texas. A site is expected to be chosen by the end of this year.",
            "Dow represents a fleet deployment opportunity in itself – it operates manufacturing sites in 31 countries where the Xe-100 could be used to decarbonise operations. It may join forces with X-Energy to license the technology to other industrial customers as well as to power utilities. X-Energy had previously been in discussion with Energy Northwest and Grant County in Washington state, which would now have follow-on units.",
            "Clearly, the Polish market will be a kick-starter for the industry. That presents its own risks: the European market for new and existing nuclear is made more problematic because some of Poland’s fellow EU members are opposed to any type of nuclear power and will object to it. Equally, however, EU members would like to see Poland able to close its coal industry and clean up its energy industry as a whole and that may benefit SMRs.",
            "What about the large number of other technologies competing to roll out? It is likely that their opportunity will come after mass deployment of the leading options have created market ‘pull’. If the model of a small-scale reactor that is used on an industrial site is familiar to investors and to the public, it lowers those risks to deployment and can allow a new technology to be presented to an investor comfortable with accepting risk.",
            "Again, the battery market is instructive. Mass deployment of lithium ion batteries has developed both the supply chain for delivery and installation and the skill set for making returns for investors. Now the ‘market pull’ is there, attention has turned to the next technology. A recent analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance says “sodium ion batteries are more expensive than lithium ion today because of low volumes and underdeveloped supply chains. But BNEF sees potential for material savings and energy-density improvements that would provide a viable pathway for sodium ion cells to cost half what lithium iron phosphate does today”.",
            "The nuclear industry is grappling with deploying SMRs but two or three versions are showing the characteristics that have been successful for other asset classes. The technology is relatively familiar, while the small size of units mean they will be deploying in 10s, rather than singly. The question will be whether that can step up to the hundreds or thousands, to gain the true benefits of replication. That may see promising designs fall by the wayside – but that is an experience familiar across asset classes, when falling costs due to replication overtake a technology that would, on paper, look more economic. In that case experience suggests the broader energy industry and the investment community will “not let the best be the enemy of the good” and take a pragmatic decision: familiarity wins.",
            "Some SMRs are under construction worldwide are based on familiar light water designs, but are not obviously replicable in a ‘series build’ outside their home market.",
            "CAREM in Argentina is a small PWR, rated at 32 MW, intended to take advantage of an indigenous nuclear supply chain – some 70% of the components will come from Argentinian companies. In 2021 the Argentine government announced an effort to complete the reactor within three years, although the project has been in gestation for many years and dates back to the mid- 1980s. A potential follow-on project, planned for Formosa, is not identical as it would be rated at 100 MWe.",
            "China’s Linglong 1 project at Changjiang is also a small-version PWR, rated at 152 MWe and in 2016 it was the first SMR to pass a safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency. First concrete was poured in mid 2019 and late last year it was reported that equipment installation had begun.",
            "China and Russia have both named follow-up sites for their SMRs. China plans two 200 MW units in Baishan and Russia named Kurchatov in Kazakhstan as an expected home for two 300 MW units.",

            "Poland’s Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) has applied to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for a fundamental decision for six NPPs with BWRX-300 small modular reactors (SMRs). The applications, submitted by OSGE Vice President Dawid Jackiewicz, relate to six sites named during a recent conference. The locations are: Ostroleka, Wloclawek, Stawy Monowskie, Dabrowa Górnicza, Nowa Huta, Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone.",
            "The decision will formally confirm that the investment in the nuclear plants is in line with the public interest and the policies implemented by the state, including energy policy. This decision will also authorize the investor to apply for a decision to determine the location and other decisions necessary for the preparation, implementation and operation of the facilities.",
            "In December 2021, GE Hitachi, BWXT Canada and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) signed a Letter of Intent to cooperate in deploying BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland. OSGE is a joint venture between chemical producers SGE and PKN Orlen. In July 2022 OSGE submitted an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency for the assessment of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300.",
            "Earlier in April, copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA submitted an application for a decision-in-principle for the construction in Poland of a US NuScale VOYGR SMR. In addition, Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe submitted an application for a decision-in-principle on the construction of a Westinghouse's AP1000 NPP at either Lubiatowo or Kopalino in Choczewo municipality.",
            "In response to OSGE’s latest application, three local leaders from areas near one of the named sites, Stawy Monowskie, located on the border of the city and the Auschwitz commune, sent a joint letter to OSGE. It noted that the planned reactor “is supposed to be a source of energy for Synthos, which is based in Auschwitz”.",
            "The letter was signed by the head of Oświęcim commune, Mirosław Smolarek; the president of the city of Auswi Wcim, Janus Chwierut; and the mayor of Oswi uscimski, Andrzej Skrzypiński. “We understand that these kinds of investments are a big step into the future. However, it raises a lot of uncertainty and concerns for the surrounding community,” it said. “For us as local authorities, the security of our residents is as important as the development of the city and the municipality of Auschwitz and the entire land of Auschwi micim. We have to respond to all the questions and doubts, and we are responsible for the future of the region.”",
            "It continued: “Therefore, we expect from the company a partnership and detailed information about the planned investment, primarily the exact location, technology, the investment process, the formal and legal status of the project and its schedule. This will allow us to take a stand on an undertaking that undoubtedly will be of great importance to our community, and also answer questions you may have. We also expect that Orlen Synthos Green Energy will include residents in the information process, listen to their opinions and provide reliable knowledge about small nuclear reactors and the investment itself in our territory.”",

        "text": [
            "US PacifiCorp, owner of the ageing Wyoming coal plant selected in 2021 as the future site for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor demonstration project, has released its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). This considers the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer in Wyoming is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology, developed in collaboration with GE Hitachi. The plant will feature a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt–based energy storage system. This could boost the reactor’s output to 500 MWe when necessary to integrate with variable renewable energy sources.",
            "However, in December, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of its Kemmerer reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies.",
            "“The advanced nuclear resources that appear in the plan [IRP] represent a promising future for our employees and communities in rural Utah and Wyoming,” stated Rick Link, senior vice president of resource planning, procurement & optimisation at PacifiCorp. “As we transition to a net-zero energy future, it is important to leverage the experience, skills, and dedication of the communities that have supplied our energy needs for the past century.” Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s president & CEO said he was pleased with the additional Natrium units in the IRP and looked forward to continuing to work with PacifiCorp.",
            "However, overall advanced reactors play only a minor role in the 365-page IRP. The biennial long-term resource plan calls for a dramatic increase of nearly four times the company’s current wind and solar resources to a total of 20,000 MW by 2032, in addition to 7,400 MW of energy storage by 2029. While the plan continues investments in innovative emissions-free technologies, including advanced nuclear and non-emitting peaking resources, their realisation will depend on wider developments.",
            "“Our Integrated Resource Plan is designed to determine the lowest-cost options for customers, adjusting for risks, future customer needs, system reliability, market projections and changing technology,” said Link. “We depended a great deal on public involvement by utility regulators, customers and other stakeholder groups to develop this plan.”",
            "The IRP says it was “developed through comprehensive data analysis and computer modelling of the future needs of customers, together with an assessment of available resource types” and “yields a preferred portfolio of resources across a 20-year planning horizon”. It “selects the least-cost, least-risk resource types, which will become the basis for a future Request for Proposals, a competitive bidding process that will select specific projects for construction”.",
            "It would appear that Pacificorp’s inclusion of the Natrium technology is, to a large extent, dependent on government support. “We’re working with TerraPower, as part of a public-private partnership with the US Department of Energy [DOE], to support the development of advanced nuclear reactors with integrated salt storage projects near retiring coal plants.” It continues: “In the 2023 IRP, the NatriumTM demonstration project is envisioned for placement at the Naughton facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming. With recent federal legislation and studies on the opportunities of a coal-to-nuclear energy transition, TerraPower and PacifiCorp remain committed to bringing the Natrium technology to market for the benefit of grid reliability and stability and for energy-producing communities in Wyoming and Utah.”",
            "It further notes that in October 2020 that DOE through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP), had awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate the Natrium technology. To date, Congress has appropriated $160m for the ARDP and DOE has committed additional funding in the coming years, subject to appropriations. In June 2021, PacifiCorp announced efforts with TerraPower and DOE “to advance the NatriumTM demonstration project to be sited at a retiring coal plant near, Kemmerer, Wyoming”.",
            "On October 2022, TerraPower and PacifiCorp announced a joint study to evaluate the feasibility of deploying up to five additional NatriumTM reactor and integrated energy storage systems in the PacifiCorp service territory by 2035. “The joint study will evaluate, among other things, the potential for advanced reactors to be located near current fossil-fuelled generation sites, enabling PacifiCorp to repurpose existing generation and transmission assets for the benefit of its customers.”",
            "The IRP specifies: “With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and recent studies on the opportunities of a coal-to-nuclear energy transition, TerraPower and PacifiCorp remain committed to bringing the NatriumTM technology to market and providing reliability and stability to the grid as well as to energy producing communities.”",
            "At the end of the report, the IRP looks at a number of different scenarios. The only one with a positive assessment of advanced nuclear is “High CO2 prices with accelerated coal retirements”. In this case, the Near-Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2023-2032) will “accelerate timing of new resource additions including an advanced nuclear resource from 2033 to 2032”. The Long Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2033-2042) envisages that, “by 2042, new nuclear peaking capacity is increased by 500 MW”.",
            "However, the “No NatriumTM Advanced Nuclear Demonstration Project in 2030, and no other nuclear projects” scenario offers a different perspective. The Near-Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2023-2032) notes: “Without the NatriumTM demonstration project, 289 MW of non-emitting peaking resource is added in 2030. In 2032 the second advanced nuclear plant is replaced by 303 MW of non-emitting peaking resource and 200 MW of four-hour battery storage.",
            "The Long Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2033-2042) notes: “Without the NatriumTM demonstration project, 289 MW of non-emitting peaking resource is added in 2030. In 2032 the second advanced nuclear plant is replaced by 303 MW of non-emitting peaking resource and 200 MW of four-hour battery storage. In 2033, 303 MW of non-emitting peaking resources and 200 MW of four-hour battery storage replace 500 MW of nuclear capacity.",
            "The IRP says scenario risk assessment “pertains to abrupt or fundamental changes to variables that are appropriately handled by scenario analysis as opposed to representation by a statistical process or expected-value forecast”. It adds: “The single most important scenario risks of this type facing PacifiCorp continues to be government actions related to emissions and changes in load and transmission infrastructure…. The company’s use of IRP sensitivity analysis covering different resource policy and cost assumptions also addresses the need for consideration of scenario risks for long-term resource planning. The extent to which future regulatory policy shifts do not align with PacifiCorp’s resource investments determined to be prudent by state commissions is a risk borne by customers.",
            "Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more then 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.” While Natrium is anticipated to come online in the summer of 2030, the 2023 IRP “includes two ‘no nuclear’ variant studies … designed to inform alternative path analysis and potential costs and benefits. PacifiCorp continues to evaluate nuclear resources within the context of an evolving planning environment”."

            "The year 2009 wasn’t good for many and certainly not for Canada’s nuclear industry. The “great recession” that began with the US housing bubble in 2007 was the longest recession since World War II and saw the largest gross domestic product drop in the post-war era. Globally, for the nuclear industry the pains of the recession were exacerbated by the March 2011 tsunami that swamped both the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and, with it, confidence in the industry.",
            "The recession dealt a heavy blow to the Canadian nuclear sector but it weathered Fukushima better than many thanks to strong social license in its host communities. That never faltered. Where some jurisdictions are still in early recovery today and others have remained stalled, the Canadian industry has advanced its capability significantly in the past decade. It is well poised as the world rediscovers nuclear, or in some cases, considers it for the first time, with a new appreciation for its ability to uniquely address the urgency of climate change and energy security.",
            "In Canada, the nuclear sector has spent the past decade steadily employed thanks to massive refurbishment projects and early action on small modular reactors that has helped solidify the industry as a cohesive and effective whole. But the genesis for today’s success traces back to the industry’s response to the adversity it faced in 2009 when its future seemed anything less than certain.",
            "From challenged past to promising future",
            "Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, is the epicentre of nuclear power in Canada. In 2006, the provincial government and its power generation utility, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), began preparations to build two additional large-scale units at OPG’s Darlington Nuclear site. The units would be built alongside the pre- existing four CANDU units (3512 MW total), constructed in the 1990s.",
            "But, in June 2009, after an intense bidding process, the Ontario government cancelled the new build. The decision followed a federal government announcement a few months earlier when it stated it would privatise Atomic Energy Canada Ltd. (AECL), the national original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for CANDU technology, as a valve for taxpayer relief.",
            "In Ontario’s decision to axe its new build, it cited the uncertainty of AECL’s future, and the price tag. The Province said the company had submitted the only fully compliant bid to the terms, which included that the vendor assume all project risks (France’s Areva SA and then US-based Westinghouse Electric Co. had also participated in the bidding). Downward energy-demand forecasts reflecting the gut-kick to the province’s manufacturing sector also factored in the decision.",
            "The fact there was a competitive process at all had generated significant angst. Many felt the two levels of government should have used the opportunity for a domestic build to give AECL, and the supply chain that largely resides in Ontario, a leg up in the international market; a sore spot that remains for some, today.",
            "The new build cancellation felt like a nail in the coffin for beleaguered AECL and equally for the supply chain that relied upon it and on Ontario’s nuclear programme.",
            "At the same time the door closed on new build, decisions had to be made on the province’s existing reactors, coming due for mid-life refurbishments. In February 2010, the Province announced it would move forward with a full refurbishment of the four existing Darlington units. On another timeline, it also signed contracts for Bruce Power to complete life extensions for all of the Bruce’s eight units (6550 MW total) through major component replacements (MCRs). The Province’s commitments were a lifeline but were contingent on on-time, on-budget performance with off-ramps that kicked in if the industry failed to deliver. Recognising the do-or-die reality with no new build in sight, the industry rallied.",
            "The utilities, in collaboration with their Tier-1 suppliers and contractors, invested in innovations in planning, project management, training equipment and techniques as well as procurement and construction. This included integration of artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, robotics and virtual reality training techniques, not just in the projects but for more effective operations and outages. To date, the OPG refurbishments and Bruce Power major component replacement project executions have been cause for celebration.",
            "Pickering Nuclear, Canada’s oldest operating plant directly adjacent to Toronto, with six operating units (3100 MW) has received extensions to continue operation beyond the original planned 2020 closure thanks to strong performance in the last decade. In 2022, reflecting the exponential increase in demand for low-carbon electricity, the four newest Pickering Nuclear units (vintage mid-1980s) are now being reviewed for refurbishment feasibility, as well.",
            "The refurbishments aren’t just good news for the carbon- free energy they’ll deliver for the next 30+ years. They have served as the training ground for a cohesive Canadian supply chain that is evolving its expertise to support continued CANDU operation and new SMR technologies, in Canada and globally.",
            "On the strength of the refurbishment performance and the accelerated speed in increased demand for low- carbon energy, in late 2021, OPG leveraged its existing site preparation license (from the new build that never materialized) and selected GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 for Canada’s first on-grid SMR reactor on the Darlington site. In March 2023, the BWRX-300 hit a major licensing milestone when it completed both phases of the Canadian regulatory Vendor Design Review (VDR). OPG, GE-Hitachi and the related supply chain have already begun to export experience here for opportunities in the global market.",
            "A new era for nuclear science in Canada",
            "Meanwhile, at AECL, 14 years on, stability has long been restored. The government-maintained ownership of the nuclear science and technology agenda by creating a Go-Co (government owned-contractor operated) arrangement, currently between AECL and Canadian National Energy Alliance (CNEA), to revitalise and operate Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) at Chalk River and to manage remediation and waste management at several legacy sites. Amongst its priorities, CNL, the architect of the CANDU programme, has pursued an ambitious small modular reactor programme with several global design vendors to support Canada’s SMR goals. Recently, CNL signed several memoranda with Canadian universities to strengthen the talent and research pipeline. Canada has two pre-eminent nuclear engineering and science universities in Ontario: Ontario Tech University and McMaster University, as well as several others that also bring some nuclear-specific education and research. With the nuclear expansion ahead, work is underway to expand the reach of nuclear education across Canada.",
            "AECL also sold its nuclear reactor sales and servicing division to SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian EPC company of more than 50,000 employees, globally, though AECL maintains intellectual property rights. SNC-Lavalin has spent the past decade putting its Canadian nuclear team through its paces as the co-lead on the engineering, construction and procurement activities for the Darlington refurbishment alongside partner Aecon. It is also a preferred supplier on the Bruce Power MCR. In a move it called “transformative” SNC-Lavalin acquired London-based Atkins in 2017, strengthening its global reach and expanding its capabilities.",
            "In January 2023, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon entered another agreement with OPG, this time to deploy the BWRX-300 at Darlington before the end of the decade. But should anyone think this SMR focus means CANDU is forgotten, Bill Fox head of SNC-Lavalin’s Canadian nuclear operations and CEO of its Candu Energy division said otherwise in a March 3rd interview with Energy Intelligence.",
            "“In fact, we’ve been planning a new build CANDU for years, and we never stopped planning,” he said. “We’ve been developing our technology since the acquisition of the commercial operations of AECL and looking at advanced reactor designs… designs that are more economical, that are built with digital tools and reducing valves and making components more passive than active, with (no) operator interventions required.” What’s needed to move forward, he says, is a buyer.",
            "Given the needed scale of new low-carbon power to meet Canada’s legislated goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, many believe it is just a matter of time before the next large-scale procurement begins. For example, even in Ontario, with one of the lowest-carbon electricity grids in the world, the electricity system operator’s recent demand forecast calls for an additional 17,800 MW of nuclear by 2050 in part, for electrification of the province’s transportation and heating needs, currently dependent on oil and gas.",
            "And here enters a possible new twist. Canadian-owned Cameco, one of the world’s largest suppliers of nuclear fuel with end-to-end services from mining to processing, announced in October 2022 that it was partnering with another Canadian energy powerhouse, Brookfield Renewables, to acquire Westinghouse Electric. In addition to strengthening Cameco’s dominance in fuel, including HALEU capability for SMRs, it also means Cameco and Brookfield Renewables will have ownership of the AP1000 and e-Vinci micro reactor designs, the latter of which is actively in the Canadian market already. Westinghouse opens Cameco up to greater opportunities globally, but it will be interesting to see what it means for the Canadian playing field, as well.",
            "A half century ago, if you worked in nuclear in Canada, odds were, you worked for AECL or Ontario Hydro, the predecessor mega-utility from which OPG spawned. Today, what it means to be a Canadian in nuclear is as diverse as Canada’s multicultural diaspora.",
            "There are more than a half dozen active purpose-build SMR design firms working in the domestic market, including one Canadian-founded one, Terrestrial Energy. With the Westinghouse acquisition, there are now two Canadian-owned large-scale technologies.",
            "There is a vibrant supply community of more than 200 companies ready to take Canadian experience to other markets, across the technologies they’ve worked on here. Universities and colleges are building the talent pools and collaborating globally to support others looking to do the same.",
            "The Canadian regulator has advanced SMRs through a vendor design review process and leveraging collaboration with other jurisdictions for a harmonised approach that Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission President Rumina Velshi says is to “protect people from risk, not to hinder progress.”",
            "Canada’s Nuclear Waste Management Organization is well on track to site a deep geologic repository for long-term management of the nation’s spent fuel to ensure a socially accepted solution to nuclear sustainability.",
            "There are industries looking to decarbonise with micro and small reactors at their sites. And, there are communities across Canada, small and large, including Indigenous communities, who are engaging as active partners to be part of workforces and to power their lives and economies with nuclear technologies.",
            "For the first time in a long time, the federal government acknowledges the importance of nuclear in Canada’s energy mix. The industry is hoping it will do more, like counterparts in other jurisdictions, such as the UK. Because nuclear has become part of Canada’s DNA and the country is ready to take it global.",
            "Now it can only hope that this time, recessionary forecasts and unsettled geopolitics do not overtake the world’s commitment to a clean energy future.",

            "US-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) are teaming up with Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and Poland’s Synthos Green Energy (SGE) to advance global deployment of the GEH BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR).",
            "The BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH’s ESBWR which has US Nuclear Regulatory Commission certification. As a result of design simplification, GEH claims the BWRX-300 will require significantly less capital cost per MW compared with other SMR designs. GEH says the BWRX-300 is being designed to reduce construction and operating costs below other nuclear power generation technologies. It will leverage a combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components as well as a design based on an already licensed reactor.",
            "TVA, OPG and SGE will invest in the development of the BWRX-300 standard design and detailed design for key components, including reactor pressure vessel and internals. GEH says it is committed to standard design development and anticipates a total investment of around $400m associated with the development. Each party will fund a share of GEH's overall cost and together will form a Design Centre Working Group to ensure the standard design is deployable in multiple jurisdictions. The long-term goal is for the BWRX-300 design to be licensed and deployed in Canada, the USA and Poland as well as globally.",
            "The agreement came a few days after Ontario-based BWX Technologies (BWXT) was awarded an engineering contract by GEH for the BWRX-300 reactor pressure vessel (RPV). Earlier in March, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) completed a combined phases 1&2 vendor design review (VDR) of the BWRX-300. The VDR is an optional service provided by CNSC at the request of a vendor and does not involve issuance of a licence, or influence subsequent CNSC decisions.",
            "GEH President & CEO Jay Wileman said the new collaboration “will offer benefits to each of the team members and demonstrates confidence in the role that our SMR technology will play in helping nations meet decarbonisation and energy security goals. Building on our design-to-cost approach, this collaboration will further strengthen the cost competitiveness of the BWRX-300.\"",
            "TVA President & CEO Jeff Lyash said: \"Working together, we are taking intentional steps to advance new nuclear in the US and around the world. TVA is leading the way for the nation by investing and helping to shape the standard design of the GEH BWRX-300, which will add more reliable, resilient, affordable and clean energy on the grid.\"",
            "The BWRX-300 has drawn interest from a number of key companies, including those involved in the new collaboration. In February, Estonia's Fermi Energia selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment by the early 2030s and expects to sign a project development and preliminary works contract with GEH. In January, GEH, OPG, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed a contract for the deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at OPG's Darlington site. In August 2022, TVA began planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site in Tennessee. Canada's SaskPower in June 2022 selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s.",
            "GEH says site preparation is now underway for a BWRX-300 at OPG's Darlington New Nuclear Project site in Clarington, Ontario, with construction expected to be complete by the end of 2028. TVA is preparing a construction permit application for a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site near Oak Ridge and is exploring additional sites in the TVA service area for potential SMR deployment. ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE), a joint venture between SGE and PKN Orlen, and its partners have started the pre-licensing process in Poland by submitting an application to the National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE has initiated a site selection process for its proposed first BWRX-300 and intends to deploy this first unit by the end of this decade with the future potential for a fleet of BWRX-300s.",
            "\"Nuclear power will play a key role in meeting increasing clean electricity needs in Ontario and beyond, which is why OPG is constructing North America's first grid-scale SMR at the Darlington New Nuclear Project site,\" said OPG President & CEO Ken Hartwick.",
            "Rafal Kasprów, CEO of Synthos Green Energy said: \"For the first time ever, a private Polish company is investing in a design for nuclear power plants. We do this because GE Hitachi's state-of-the-art modular technology is simply ideal for decarbonising energy and heat production in Poland, and also for our other zero emission projects in the United Kingdom and throughout Central Europe.\"",
            "US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff said the partnership was a model for \"precisely the kind of first-mover visionary private investment-driven effort\" needed to drive deployment at scale. \"It takes a lot of dollars to make real change happen, and the federal government can't provide all of those dollars. Our one dollar needs to turn into trillions of dollars on the private side, and this group of individuals is doing just that,\" she said.",
            "US Department of Energy (DOE) recently published the first of its Commercial Liftoff reports, to support dialogue with the private sector on the pathways to \"commercial lift-off\" for a range of technologies including advanced nuclear. \"This partnership is precisely what will result in commercial lift-off for small modular reactors which DOE is really excited about as a technology,\" Huff noted.",

The province of Alberta, along with New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan, has agreed to a joint strategic plan to support SMR development.",
            "ARC will begin the process to expand its operations in Alberta with the aim of developing a fleet of ARC-100 reactors. With IAC support, ARC will begin engagement and partnership activities with industry and stakeholders. ARC said it will also develop the associated supply chains and manufacturing, operating and support services necessary for the construction and operation of multiple ARC-100 units.",
            "The ARC-100 was earlier selected in 2018 for deployment at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station (PLNGS) in New Brunswick as part of Canada’s SMR Roadmap, with operation planned for 2029. The ARC-100 design completed the first of three phases of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Vendor Design Review (VDR) in 2019. Also in 2019, ARC signed an agreement with US-based global infrastructure firm AECOM to continue its development of the ARC-100 technology.",
            "In July 2022, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) entered into a collaboration agreement with ARC, funded through CNL’s Canadian Nuclear Research Initiative (CNRI), for work to advance the fuel development and manufacturing processes to produce fuel for ARC’s technology. The following December, Canada’s Belledune Port Authority also proposed using an ARC aSMR to generate a minimum of 1GW of heat and power for industrial users at the port’s Green Energy Hub. Pending feasibility studies, environmental approvals and CNSC licensing, the project is planned for commercial operation between 2030 and 2035.",
            "The ARC-100 is a 100MWe integrated sodium-cooled fast reactor with a metallic uranium alloy core. The design is based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) fast reactor prototype which operated at the USA's Argonne National Laboratory from 1961 to 1994. ARC Nuclear signed an agreement with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in March 2017 to collaborate on the development and licensing of an SMR using proprietary technology from GEH's PRISM reactor, which is also based on the EBR-II.",
            "However, all fast reactor projects in Europe and North America were essentially abandoned in the 1970a and 1980s and had effectively ceased in Europe and the US by the 1990s. Although interest in fast reactor technology is now reviving in Europe and the USA, both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the design phase. The projected operation dates for the ARC-100 may, therefore, prove to be optimistic. Currently fast reactor development continues apace only in Russia, China and India, where there are now five fast reactors in operation and five more under development.",
            "William Labbe, president & CEO of ARC Clean Technology Canada, said early deployment of the company's SMR technology would bring high quality jobs, significant investment, and economic benefits. \"With Alberta being Canada's energy and heavy industry leader, it is a natural market for ARC's industrial applications and will be a key stepping stone for the global deployment of Canadian SMR technology,\" he said.",
            "IAC CEO Rick Christiaanse believes meaningful partnerships with leading cleantech innovators such as ARC bring \"impactful net-zero solutions\" to the province. He said: \"Momentum is building in Alberta around SMR technology, with Invest Alberta signing MOUs with several companies that are on the path to launching proven sustainable energy supplies in the province.\"",
            "Invest Alberta, a Crown corporation of the Government of Alberta, is also supporting other SMR projects. An MOU was signed with X-Energy Canada to develop economic opportunities supporting the potential deployment of the Xe-100 SMR.

The nuclear island will only occupy the area of a football field. Due to significantly lower capital expenditures and the speed of building the BWRX-300 reactor from modules, the programme of creating a network of small NPPs is currently considered the most effective and fastest way to transform the Polish energy and heating sector towards decarbonisation and achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions.\"",

            "\"Our cooperation will involve joint financing and cost sharing of the undertaking,\" NFOSiGW deputy CEO Artur Michalski told a press conference. “In addition to being a government institution for the Minister of Climate & the Environment, and thus providing government support and cooperation, we are a financial institution, he noted. NFOŚiGW will become a shareholder of a company that will build small nuclear reactors in Poland by recapitalising it, he explained. \"We have domestic and foreign funds, primarily EU… but we intend to base this undertaking on domestic funds,\" he said. \"Our goal is to co-finance this venture with stable capital….

            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. “While the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,” according to NEA. “Recent NEA analysis … finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.”",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

            "NEA notes that SMRs can replace fossil fuels for on-grid power generation, diesel generators for off-grid mining and industrial operations, and fossil fuels for cogeneration of heat and power for heavy industries and district heating. They can also enable large-scale water treatment and desalination to produce clean potable water. “These varied market needs have prompted the development of a range of SMR technologies, which vary in technology, sizes, and configuration.” NEA comments: “Policymakers are often overwhelmed with this great variety as they strive to consider which designs might meet their particular needs and in what time frame.”",
            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development.

The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",

The VDR takes place during the design process and gives CNSC an opportunity to provide early feedback. It is an optional service provided by CNSC at the request of a vendor. It does not involve issuance of a licence, or influence subsequent CNSC decisions.",
            "During the three-year review of the BWRX-300, which began in 2019, CNSC examined more than 200 documents and attended technical presentations. It also participated in a week-long evaluation, and sent questions across 19 focus areas.",

            "Czech power utility ČEZ says it has tentatively identified two preferred construction sites for small modular reactors (SMRs), in addition to the Temelín pilot location. The two sites in Dětmarovice and Tušimice are currently coal-fired power plants, which are being transformed for emission-free operation. As part of its Vision 2030, ČEZ Group is committed to preparing for the construction of SMRs with a total capacity of over 1,000 MWe after 2040.",
            "In addition to these first three SMR construction sites, ČEZ is exploring other locations. These include the Prunéřov, Ledvice, Poříčí and Mělník coal sites as well as the Dukovany NPP. However, initial analysis has already recommended that the Poříčí power plant location should not be further developed due to the almost certain presence of a nearby active fault near the site, which precludes the placement of nuclear technology.",
            "\"Small modular reactors are not a substitute for large nuclear units, but a complement to the energy mix of the Czech Republic as a suitable replacement for coal-fired power plants and large thermal power plants,” says Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ Board of Directors and Chief Renewables Officer. “The SMR construction programme represents a great opportunity for the Czech economy. It offers production of nuclear equipment, substantial involvement in the supply chain, and the creation of a regional service and training centre.”",
            "He added: “In order to take advantage of the opportunities of the SMR programme, action must be taken quickly. We expect that new nuclear sources, including SMRs, will also be significantly represented in the upcoming update of the State Energy Concept. This, in the long term, builds the Czech energy mix on a combination of nuclear and renewable sources.\"",
            "The Dětmarovice and Tušimice power plant sites will undergo further intensive exploration and monitoring before it is finally clear whether they are suitable locations for a nuclear power source. The exploration work, which began in the first half of February, is primarily focused on excluding the existence of active tectonic faults, assessing the hydrogeology of the area and analysing the bedrock. This phase should be completed by the autumn and others will then follow. ČEZ noted that the transformation of a non-nuclear site into a nuclear site requires a series of exploration activities lasting 3-5 years before the permit process can begin.",
            "The first SMR will be built near the Temelín NPP and should be completed before the new large nuclear unit is launched at the site, which is planned for 2040. ČEZ cooperates with the South Bohemian region and its subsidiary ÚJV Řež as part of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park, which covers research, development and preparation for construction. While the investor for the SMR has yet to be decided the site has been decided. The area is part of the wider Temelín NPP site, which has recently undergone a special seismic mission.",
            "ČEZ Group has already signed a memoranda of cooperation om SMRs with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, Westinghouse, KHNP and Holtec. ČEZ says it is ready to participate in the scientific research activities and development of SMRS for all these companies through its ÚJV Řež subsidiary.",

        "text": [
            "Denmark's Copenhagen Atomics has applied for its containerised small modular thorium molten salt reactor design to undergo Generic Design Assessment (GDA) in the UK.",
            "UK Atomics, a subsidiary of the company applied to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) for a GDA by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (EA). This assessment aims to assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of any nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in the UK.",
            "In May 2021, BEIS opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the EA. Rolls-Royce SMR was the first vendor to submit an application for a GDA of an SMR design. Its 470 MWe pressurised water reactor design was accepted for review in March 2022. In December, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR, and Holtec International has stated its intention to submit an application for its SMR-160 design.",
            "UK Atomics molten salt reactor design uses unpressurised heavy water as a moderator, while the reactor is intended to burn nuclear waste while breeding new fuel from thorium. The company says, with an output of 100 MWt, it is small enough to allow for mass manufacturing and assembly line production.",
            "UK Atomics CEO and co-founder Thomas Steenberg said the technology “has the added benefit of producing no greenhouse gas emissions and it does consume long-term nuclear waste from the classic nuclear industry to produce energy”. A mock-up of the reactor has been constructed at the company’s facility in Copenhagen which \"will be tested to support the goal-oriented approval process\".",
            "Copenhagen Atomics claims that the reactors will be deployed by UK Atomics, which will build, own and operate a fleet of autonomous reactors, \"eventually numbering in thousands\". This business model, selling energy-as-a-service, will enable a cost-effective and low-risk deployment, it says. The timeline it has set for operation of its first commercial reactor is 2028. The company further claims that, with low operating costs and no capital expenditure to the customer, it projects an electricity price below £40 ($48) per MWh.",
            "\"We are removing the complexity for decision makers,\" said Copenhagen Atomics cofounder Thomas Jam Pedersen. \"Companies fear the responsibility of operating a nuclear plant, decommissioning, and handling nuclear waste. We take care of all of that and just deliver reliable and green energy to the customer.\"",
            "The company was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists and engineers meeting at Technical University of Denmark and around the greater Copenhagen area for discussions on thorium and molten salt reactors, who incorporated in 2015. The following year, the company became part of European nuclear molten salt research consortium MIMOSA.",
            "Copenhagen Atomics currently markets some of their technologies commercially including pumped molten salt loops for use in molten salt reactor research, as well as highly purified salts for high temperature concentrated solar power, molten salt energy storage, and molten salt chemistry research.",
            "Recently the company raised €20m ($21.2m) to accelerate the development of its thorium molten salt reactor technology. Pedersen said the funding will support its plans to have the first commercial reactors online in 2028. The company says it is planning to test a prototype in Copenhagen in 2023. However, according to the company website, it planned non-radioactive testing of its prototype in 2022 and would then identify a country to test the radioactive version in preparation for mass production on assembly lines in 2030.",
            "According to Pederson, the company has specialised in producing molten salts, particularly fluoride salts, which are being used for early-stage testing of reactor components. Radioactive testing will not take place in Denmark, which has no state agency able to approve that sort of research. “I don’t know exactly which country will be the best for us,” he said, noting that Canada, the USA, and other European countries are all on the table.",
            "The company notes that molten salt reactors are not a new concept as they underwent significant testing in the 1950s and 1960s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fuelled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants, one of which was a molten salt breeder reactor with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation.",
            "According to Pederson, testing stopped in part because thorium was not well-suited for weapons production. “It was, from the very get-go, far behind the investments in the uranium fuel cycle, and therefore, most people were educated in the uranium fuel cycle,” he said. However, in the late 2000s documents from the ORNL tests were released to the public. “People started to discover, ‘Oh, there’s actually something here that is quite exciting.’ Because thorium is the only element where you can make a breeder cycle, or breeder reactor, in thermal spectrum.”",
            "While there is now renewed interest in MSR technology with numerous designs being developed in the US, Europe and Russia, there are, as yet, no projects anywhere near realisation."

            "Five major companies have made key announcements on their plans to advance small modular reactor (SMR) deployment in the UK. While Rolls-Royce SMR shortlisted three sites for a factory to produce component for its planned SMR; Balfour Beatty and Holtec with Hyundai agreed to support plans for the construction of Holtec’s SMR-160; and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) submitted a Generic Design Assessment (GDA) application for its BWRX-300 SMR to the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS).",
            "The three sites shortlisted by Rolls-Royce for its heavy pressure vessels (HPV) factory are: The International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) in Sunderland and South Tyneside (northeast England); Teesworks in Teesside (northeast England); and Gateway in Deeside (Wales). In July, Rolls-Royce SMR had named six potential locations for the factory, selected from more than 100 submissions from local enterprise partnerships and development agencies.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson, said this would be the first of at least three factories and will manufacture and assemble large and most complex components for a fleet of SMRs. He added: “To ensure commercial processes move in parallel, negotiations will be initiated when Rolls-Royce SMR has entered formal discussions on deployment with the Government.”",
            "The GBP100-200 million ($121-242m) factory is expected to cover 23,000 square metres and to create more than 200 permanent jobs. The other two factories will manufacture civils modules and mechanical electrical and plumbing (MEP) modules for transportation to SMR sites and assembly.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design was accepted for GDA review in March after which BEIS asking the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the environment regulators for England and Wales to begin the process. It will have the capacity to generate 470MWe and will provide consistent baseload generation for at least 60 years. Rolls-Royce SMR aims to deploy multiple units at various sites totalling around 15GWe. The SMR is fully modularised with the reactor, some 16 by 4 metres being capable of transportation by road, rail or sea. Targeting a 500-day modular build, the firm says this concept minimises the onsite time and effort required to construct and build the plant, with about 90% of manufacturing and assembly activities carried out in factory conditions.",
            "In November, Rolls-Royce SMR announced that a siting assessment review had identified a range of existing NPP sites in the UK as possible hosts for its SMRs, with four sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) prioritised. These were: Trawsfynydd (also requiring agreement with Cwmni Egino – Welsh Government); Sellafield (NDA land availability to be confirmed); Wylfa – South and Oldbury – North (both requiring agreement with Horizon Nuclear Power). Rolls-Royce identified four other sites which needed further investigation.",
            "Meanwhile, Balfour Beatty has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Holtec Britain, a subsidiary of US-based Holtec International, to support “the planning advancement for the construction of Holtec’s SMR-160 pressurised light-water reactors in the UK”. Balfour Beatty will act as the main UK construction partner in collaboration with Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (Hyundai E&C).",
            "In October, Holtec International and Hyundai E&C signed an agreement to launch an accelerated programme to complete the balance of plant design of the remaining systems and structures for the SMR-160 advanced small modular reactor (SMR). The SMR-160 is a pressurised light-water reactor, generating 160MWe (525MWt) using low-enriched uranium fuel, with flexibility to produce process heat for industrial applications and hydrogen production.",
            "Holtec International plans to submit a GDA application for the SMR-160 in 2023 with the aim of starting construction of the first UK unit in 2028. Holtec in November applied to BEIS for funding support for the GDA. The company said it intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s – representing a total capacity of 5,100 MWe – in serial production by 2050 to bring “reliable and affordable electricity and heat to UK households, businesses, and industrial users”.",
            "Holtec has also joined a consortium with 15 major companies to establish the Moorside Clean Energy Hub in North West England. This includes a number of nuclear projects at Moorside, including a new UK-EPR pressurised water reactor together with “potentially a clutch of SMRs and other innovative technologies”.",
            "Holtec said that, under the agreement with Balfour and Hyundai E&C “the parties will develop the division of responsibilities for procurement, construction, and commissioning of SMR-160 plants in the UK in accordance with UK regulatory and industrial practices and with inclusion of UK suppliers”. They will also “jointly develop a cost estimate for deployment of the SMR-160 in the UK based on Holtec’s standard design developed for the US Market, while waiting for the UK Government to determine the process for site selection”.",
            "Holtec added that it has identified three potential UK sites with existing NPPs “suitable for hosting the first wave of Holtec SMR-160s, at Trawsfynydd in Wales and Heysham and Oldbury in England”. Holtec Britain Director Gareth Thomas noted: “We are advancing project delivery plans with our UK Team based on the information available for these sites and our corporate office committed to match funding the GDA with BEIS. Our GDA application provides incredible value for government’s money considering that SMR-160’s development has been essentially funded by Holtec for well over a decade and the requested governmental support is only for “gap funding” to complete the GDA process.”",
            "Another contender for the UK’s first SMR is North Carolina-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) which announced submission of a GDA entry application for the BWRX-300 SMR to BEIS. The BWRX-300 is a 300MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor. It is currently undergoing a pre-licensing Vendor Design Review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).",
            "Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Canada as early as 2028 and recently submitted its licence to construct application for the Darlington site to the CNSC. SaskPower and the US Tennessee Valley Authority have also selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment. In Poland, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) started the pre-licensing process by applying to the National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300.",
            "Sean Sexstone, GEH Executive Vice President, Advanced Nuclear noted that the regulatory agencies in Canada and the US are collaborating on their licensing review of the BWRX-300. “Through the GDA process we look forward to engaging UK regulators and enabling collaboration with their global counterparts,” he said.",
            "GEH said it was supported in preparation of the GDA entry application by Jacobs UK, which has supported licensing applications for new nuclear power plant projects in the UK since 2007. In September, GEH and the The UK’s Sheffield Forgemasters agreed to cooperate in support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 in the UK. They agreed to discuss how the existing and future capabilities of Sheffield Forgemasters could help meet the potential demands of BWRX-300 deployment.",
            "In December 2021, Rolls-Royce SMR also signed a GBP3.7m contract with Sheffield Forgemasters to enable the first development forgings to be manufactured to support the deployment of Rolls-Royce SMRs. The race is clearly on. It remains to be seen who will be the winner.",

        "title": "Terrapower’s natrium reactor project delayed by lack of HALEU",
        "text": [
            "US Terrapower’s advanced Natrium nuclear reactor proposed for southwestern Wyoming is expected to be delayed by at least two years, Jeff Navin, TerraPower’s director of external affairs has told the Caspar Star-Tribune. Following Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, the supply of high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) needed to fuel the reactor is now in doubt. “We had a plan. It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first coreload of fuel come from Russia,” Navin said.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, including two planned demonstration reactors – Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors.",
            "In June 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and PacifiCorp announced efforts to advance their Natrium reactor demonstration project at a retiring coal plant in Wyoming, ultimately deciding on Naughton Power Plant outside Kemmerer as the site.",
            "The Natrium system is a TerraPower and GE Hitachi technology. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners. The project features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe of power for more than five and a half hours when needed.",
            "Building a fleet of advanced nuclear reactors hinges on securing a dependable fuel source. But the private sector is reluctant to risk too much money on an industry still in its infancy. Russia, the only commercial source of HALEU fuel, was supposed to bridge that gap, but this is now in question, Navin noted.",
            "Terrapower initially turned to the US Department of Energy (DOE). In the hope that the government would be able to source sufficient weapons-grade uranium (most of which will come from nuclear warheads) enriched to around 95% and downblend it to the lower concentration needed. Officials tried, Navin said, and are still looking. “They just don’t have the capacity to disassemble a large volume of warheads any faster than they’re already disassembling them.”",
            "TerraPower is also looking to Congress, which allocated half the funding for the roughly $4 billion Wyoming project and has increased efforts to accelerate commercial fuel production. These efforts are being supported by Senator John Barrasso, (Wyoming). Barrasso said in a statement on 13 December that “TerraPower’s announcement underscores what I’ve been saying for years: America must re-establish itself as the global leader in nuclear energy. Instead of relying on our adversaries like Russia for uranium, the United States must produce its own supply of nuclear fuel.”",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million toward that effort. In December 2022, DOE established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio.",
            "The federal support will go a long way to attract private investmenta and establish a reliable, commercial supply of HALEU in the US, perhaps in time to meet the 2028 in-service deadline in Kemmerer, Navin said. But the Natrium reactor will require an initial “core load” fuel delivery in 2025, which is why TerraPower is asking federal officials to downblend enough weapons-grade uranium to meet that timeline. Combined, TerraPower’s Natrium and X-energy’s Xe-100 demonstration projects could require about 20 metric tons of HALEU derived from downblending, Navin estimated. Centrus Energy Corp   will begin producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023.",
            "However, Navin said the fuel problems are “not going to change our schedule, in terms of when we’re going to start construction – it gives us a little more flexibility on that point”. In 2023, TerraPower still aims to break ground on a test facility at the project site, where both remaining coal units at electric utility PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant are slated to retire in 2025, and apply for a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "“We all recognised when we started this process, it was never going to be easy,” he said. “We didn’t anticipate this particular curveball, but this is, certainly, of all of the challenges that we’re facing, the one that is going to cause the biggest delay.” TerraPower remains confident, however, that the U.S. supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035. Its joint study with PacifiCorp of the available options, announced in October, is on track to be finished late next year.",
            "“We obviously have to focus on getting the first one built,” Navin said. “There’s always hiccups in a first-of-a-kind project. But we really are committed to working with our customer in PacifiCorp and trying to find a way to even expand the footprint that we have in Wyoming.”",
            "One other question, however, remains. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. The US Department of Energy (DOE) in July issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades. Even if the fuel problem is somehow resolved, this could be another obstacle.",

It was originally designed as a 300-tonne-a-year fuel reprocessing plant, but was declared inoperable in 1974. NRC issued the facility its first ISFSI 20-year licence in 1982, which was renewed for 20-years in 2000.",
            "The announcement was published in the US Federal Register on 28 November. The renewed licence is valid until 31 May 2042. GEH had submitted the renewal application in June 2020 and the NRC said that it had received \"no request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene\".",
            "According to NRC, a safety evaluation report had concluded that the ISFSI would continue to meet the required regulations and \"NRC staff also prepared an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for the subsequent renewal of this licence\" and concluded that the renewal of the licence \"will not have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment\".",
            "In its environmental impact assessment, published on 17 November, the NRC said: \"Approval of the proposed action is not expected to result in changes to current ISFSI operations. Routine operation of the ISFSI is largely passive; activities include continuation of existing monitoring and maintenance activities for the wet storage basins, which are inside a building.",
            "\"GE Hitachi would continue to operate onsite sanitary wastewater lagoons in compliance with its state-issued permit and would manage the radioactive wastewater system and solid radioactive wastes generated from ISFSI operations in accordance with NRC regulations. No wastewater would be discharged from the property. As a result of these continued ISFSI activities, no significant radiological or non-radiological environmental impacts are expected.\"",
            "NRC noted that if it did not renew the licence, GEH would still have to continue storage at the ISFSI until the contents could be transferred to another ISFSI and it would then have to decommission Morris Operation ISFSI. It did not consider this to be “a reasonable alternative to renewing the licence” no other facilities were available. \"Continued storage of the spent fuel and continued operation of the ISFSI is necessary because Congress has not yet established a permanent national repository, and no facility is yet available for monitored retrievable storage,\" NRC said.",

        "text": [
            "GE Research, the central technology development hub for the General Electric Company, has announced that it has been selected to receive $6.4 million in funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) to advance nuclear fuel reprocessing technology.",
            "GE Research’s project, part of ARPA-E’s Converting UNF Radioisotopes Into Energy (CURIE) programme, aims to increase the amount of used fuel that can be reprocessed while also adding new safeguards and data protection measures and has the potential to save facility reprocessing operators significant costs. Bogdan Neculaes, a Principal Scientist at GE Research and Project Leader, said that the focus of GE’s project is to provide a safer, more productive, and economically viable way to recycle used fuel, stating, “We’re aiming to develop a unique solution that would enable facility reprocessing operators to keep the tracking and measurements of used fuel flowing in the pipes of the facilities themselves. This has the potential to yield estimated savings in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in operating costs while enabling more used fuel to be recycled with enhanced safeguards.”",
            "Neculaes explained that currently, fuel reprocessing operators have to temporarily shut down plant operations to perform a full inventory of nuclear materials within the plant. Additionally, there are planned scheduled outages for these physical inventory checks. The GE Research-led physical and digital solution would enable real-time tracking and measurements of a plant’s nuclear inventory, minimising unplanned shutdowns and reducing the time required for planned shutdowns.",
            "“We will introduce novel sensors, which will involve Monochromatic Assays Yielding Enhanced Reliability (MAYER) interrogation techniques, to accurately characterize and measure the used nuclear fuel throughout the reprocessing,” Neculaes said. “This data will be transmitted continuously to GE’s AI- driven digital twin of the reprocessing facility, enabling real-time tracking and measurements of used fuel material.”",
            "Understanding that the highest standards of safety and protocols must be maintained with data, GE will integrate an advanced distributed ledger/Blockchain technology to further secure the used fuel tracking data involved. Also, the MAYER acronym describing the techniques for analysing used fuel was inspired by Nobel Prize-winning nuclear physicist, Maria Goeppert Mayer, whose work established the foundation for and helped advance the safe, reliable application of nuclear energy.",
            "Mayer’s Nobel Prize for discovering the shell model of the atomic nucleus provides the backbone for the MAYER program’s nuclear isotope sensor technology. GE Research has assembled a team of top industry and government partners to support this project, which are GE Hitachi Nuclear, Sandia National Laboratories, Orano, and Lumitron Technologies.",
            "GE Research’s team of physical and digital scientists are combining material science, chemistry, imaging and sensing with artificial intelligence and algorithms to create a digital replica of a nuclear fuel reprocessing facility that will allow fuel reprocessing operators to perform real-time tracking and measurements of a plant’s nuclear materials inventory. This would help prevent unplanned shutdowns and reduce the time for planned shutdowns, potentially saving operators hundreds of millions annually in costs.",
            "As part of the project, Sandia will provide models of reprocessing facilities that GE scientists will use to create its digital twin model. Orano, one of the world’s top nuclear fuel reprocessing operators, will provide guidance to ensure these digital models represent the most accurate depictions of a real plant facility. Lumitron Technologies specialises in monochromatic, tunable, high flux, compact laser Compton scattering radiation sources that enable the innovative sensors proposed in MAYER. GE Hitachi Nuclear will be a consulting partner with GE Research on the project, bringing a critical industry perspective as a leader in the nuclear sector.",

            "plans to bring a Natrium demonstration plant to Kemmerer, Wyoming",
            ", where a PacifiCorp coal-fuelled power plant is approaching retirement. “This joint study is a significant step toward building the energy grid of the future for PacifiCorp’s customers and a tangible example of the promise advanced nuclear brings to utilities serious about leading the nation’s energy transition,” said TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque. “We have been impressed and humbled by our work with the Kemmerer community and PacifiCorp. We look forward to evaluating new potential sites for Natrium plants that have the same energy expertise and capabilities as our demonstration site.”",
            "Gary Hoogeveen, President and CEO of Rocky Mountain Power, a division of PacifiCorp, noted: “This is just a first step, as advanced nuclear power needs to be evaluated through our resource planning processes as well as receive regulatory approval. But it’s an exciting opportunity that advances us down the path to a net zero energy future.”",
            "By working together on the Natrium demonstration plant and jointly studying the feasibility of adding up to five additional commercial units by 2035, TerraPower and PacifiCorp said they seek to identify opportunities to reduce cost for PacifiCorp’s customers and more broadly deploy advanced Natrium reactors. The joint study will evaluate, among other things, the potential for advanced reactors to be located near current fossil-fuelled generation sites, enabling PacifiCorp to repurpose existing generation and transmission assets for the benefit of its customers. The location of future Natrium plants will be thoroughly explored through this study process, and both companies will engage with local communities before any final sites are selected.",
            "TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are developing the Natrium technology, which features a sodium fast reactor combined with a molten salt energy storage system. The system features a 345MWe reactor and can be optimised for specific markets. Its innovative thermal storage has the potential to boost the system’s output to 500MWe of power for more than five and a half hours when needed. This allows for a nuclear design that follows daily electric load changes and helps customers capitalise on peaking opportunities driven by renewable energy fluctuations. As more renewables are integrated into the grid, the demand for gigawatt-hour-scale energy storage will continue to increase.",
            "Currently, however, the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US Department of Energy (DOE) in July issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades.",
            "Meanwhile, on 21 October, Global Nuclear Fuel–Americas (GNF-A), a GE-led joint venture, and TerraPower announced an agreement to build a Natrium Fuel Facility at the site of GNF-A’s existing plant site near Wilmington. The Natrium Fuel Facility will be jointly funded by TerraPower and DOE through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which aims to speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with US industry. The facility represents an investment of more than $200 million.",
            "Terrapower said the Natrium Fuel Facility and other commercial nuclear power initiatives are projected to grow the GNF-A and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) workforce by approximately 500 new employees over five years. Many of these new employees will support the Natrium reactor technology that is being jointly developed by GEH and TerraPower as well as other commercial nuclear power initiatives.",
            "Construction on the Natrium Fuel Facility is anticipated to begin in 2023. “The Natrium Fuel Facility will help establish the fuel supply chain that will be required for the US to deploy advanced reactors domestically and globally,” said Tammy Orr, senior vice president, fuel products, GNF-A. “This is a significant investment in our operation, and we’re excited to build on our more than 50-year legacy as a fuel manufacturer in support of carbon-free energy generation.”",

            "A small modular reactor (SMR) could be built in the Czech Republic at the Temelín NPP as early as 2032, Daniel Beneš, the Director of the ČEZ power group has said after signing a contract for the establishment of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park. South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba, addressing an international conference, said: \"We realise that nuclear energy is something that we fundamentally need in the republic. \"Czech industry is not only driven by renewable sources, we are not Norway, which has unlimited water capacities and produces 95% of its energy with clean hydropower plants.\"",
            "This is why it was decided to establish the South Bohemian Energy Park, using the Temelin site to build the first SMR in Europe, including an educational centre for engineers, specialists and other technical professions, he added. \"We thus have a unique opportunity to participate in the construction and development of a technical background where experts from all over Europe can be educated.\"",
            "The joint company South Bohemia Nuclear Park aims to facilitate construction of the first pilot project at Temelín which offers a protected, research space, and the presence of professional staff to ensure a synergistic effect during planning, construction and operation.",
            "This project has the support of the government, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. \"In the context of the situation in Europe, the signing of this agreement is an extremely important step. This is a landmark year, the war in Ukraine shook the international order, tested allied relations and showed the danger of dependence on resources and raw materials from risky countries,\" he noted",
            "\"Due to supply cuts, we are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of electricity and gas, a situation that threatens us and with which we must deal quickly,” he said. “The government is reacting to it with acute measures, but this is not enough, and that is why we are also working on longer-term solutions that will strengthen our energy security and independence,\" he explained, adding that it also involves building a SMR. \"These are smaller mass-produced devices that largely overcome some of the disadvantages of existing reactors. They could replace ageing power plants and heating plants,\" he concluded.",
            "Beneš emphasised that Temelin is the best possible place for the pilot project. \"At the same time, preparation for the construction of two new standard units continues. We are also working on the project of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany NPP, where we expect offers by the end of November. These buildings are not in competition with the small modular reactors we are talking about.\" He added that SMRs are complementary technologies and are more suitable for a range of different locations. \"Everything is based on the energy mix, the Czech energy mix largely relies on nuclear energy.\"",
            "In the last year, the ČEZ Group has accelerated activities related to the SMR project, having already signed memorandums of cooperation with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, KHNP and Holtec. Through its subsidiary ÚJV Řež, it is also developing SMRs locally. The HeFASTo project or the Energywell project are at an advanced stage of research and intensive cooperation is also underway with Westinghouse.",
            "\"There are seven companies in the world that deal with the preparation of such projects. We are in very active communication with all of them, we have signed memoranda of cooperation with them. They should put the first installations into operation before 2030. We have a feeling that these technologies will be ground-breaking. It makes sense to build the first pilot project next to the Temelín cooling towers.” He noted that some SMRs are almost as big as the nuclear units in Dukovany, but they are easier and faster to build than large nuclear reactors. He said the SMR in Temelín could be ready between 2032 and 2035.",
            "\"Given the current situation, we are accelerating this project. We see that it will be necessary to replace a number of coal-fired power plants and heating plants, while maintaining the maximum degree of self-sufficiency,” said Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear energy division. “SMRs are a safe and very efficient option from this point of view. \"",
            "The South Bohemian Nuclear Park is a joint project of all parties involved, covering research, development, communication and preparation of the building itself. However, an investor for the SMR has not been decided and investment costs have not yet been estimated.",

        "title": "Fermi Energia accepts bids from three SMR manufacturers",
        "text": [
            "Estonia’s Fermi Energia has sent a call for tenders to three new generation small modular reactor (SMR) developers – GE Hitachi, NuScale and Rolls-Royce. Bids with comprehensive technical documentation needed to estimate the construction cost are expected by December, and the technology selection will be made in February 2023.",
            "Fermi Energia's international partners and shareholders helped prepare the detailed call for tenders. In the selection of technology, the criteria are technological maturity, the establishment of a reference station, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain. The winner will sign a project development and preliminary works contract.",
            "\"We started selecting the technology already in 2019, at that moment mapping all the companies developing new nuclear technologies, of which there were several dozen in the world at that time,” explained Kalev Kallemets, head of Fermi Energia. Some of them have turned out to be more successful, and from the successful ones, in turn, we have to choose the most suitable for Estonian conditions and the electricity system, taking into account the final price of the produced electricity for the consumer.”",
            "He added: “All three small reactor manufacturers participating in the bid have initiated formal construction permit procedures with the regulator in major countries, and it is believed that the first reactors of their kind to be built will produce electricity at the end of the decade. It is justified to choose the best reactor technology of the new generation, which has already proven itself, to be built in Estonia.\"",
            "Fermi Energia is planning to build a new generation small reactor in Estonia to ensure electricity production independent of the weather at a long-term fixed price starting at 55€/MWh for its customers. The costs of building a small reactor with standardised, factory-produced components are significantly lower than in the case of large nuclear plants built so far, and the short construction time also helps to reduce the risk of delays and related costs.",
            "\"Compared with long-term fixed-price contracts offered to private and industrial consumers on the Baltic market, the electricity produced by a small reactor is many times more affordable, and we want to offer it to consumers with whom we have signed fixed-price electricity supply cooperation contracts,\" Kallemets said.",
            "\"Both NuScale and GE Hitachi are companies with financial support from the United States government, the British government has invested GBP210 million in the development of Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor,\" said Marti Jeltsov, Chief Technology Officer of Fermi Energia. “All three companies have achieved design maturity over the past few years, which provides significant certainty to the feasibility of the projects. The arrival of the new generation of small reactors on the market also gives Fermi Energia the opportunity to move ahead with the technology selection at a faster pace than planned.”",
            "GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 small reactor has so far been Fermi Energia's reference technology in nearly ten studies, and the construction site for construction of this reactor is already underway near Toronto, Canada. NuScale and Rolls-Royce plan to start their first constructions in the coming years.",

        "title": "Remote and digital technologies for decommissioning",
        "text": [
            "Decommissioning is a growth area with a significant number of the world’s 439 nuclear power reactors approaching retirement age. Globally, 199 power reactors have been shut down, but only 21 are fully decommissioned. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) projects that 12-25% of the 2020 nuclear electrical generating capacity is expected to be retired by 2030.",
            "While existing methods of decommissioning are more or less sufficient to the task, innovations are developing faster, safer, and more cost-effective ways of working. Digital technologies coupled with robots and drones provide for significant potential to work more effectively, and at lower risk to operators.",
            "The IAEA decommissioning survey",
            "In February, an IAEA survey on nuclear decommissioning found that in a growing number of countries immediate dismantling of retired nuclear facilities is preferred. “Previously, many programmes elected to defer dismantlement of retired facilities, but immediate dismantling is now becoming the predominant decommissioning strategy worldwide,” explained Olena Mykolaichuk, Head of the IAEA’s Decommissioning and Environmental Remediation Section.",
            "This requirement is an added driver for the use of remote and robotic technologies given the increased activity levels found in recently operating plants compared with those that have remained in shut-down state for decades.",
            "Emerging technologies coupled with increasing use of robots and drones could potentially provide more effective project implementation and risk reduction. “The use of robotic techniques and remotely controlled techniques are being presented and discussed more and more in the decommissioning community,” Tetiana Kilochytska, a decommissioning specialist in the IAEA’s Decommissioning and Environmental Remediation Section, told",
            "As part of the survey, the IAEA sent out a Global Decommissioning Strategy questionnaire to more than 50 countries and evaluated the responses alongside data from the IAEA’s Power Reactor Information System (PRIS), Research Reactor Data base (RRDB) and Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle Information System (iNFCIS). IAEA also hosted a series of technical meetings over three years that brought together dozens of experts from some 20 countries as well as the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD and the European Commission to share experiences and provide feedback.",
            "Countries managing accident sites such as those in Japan are using innovative robotic technology and remote inspection tools to locate and characterise fuel debris in an effort to retrieve and dispose of this material. Technologies such as 3D modelling or building information modelling (BIM), virtual reality and remotely controlled technologies, including drones and robots, are also being applied increasingly to the decommissioning of facilities. These technologies enable more efficient collection, understanding, display and management of data, allowing different scenarios to be visualised during planning and preparation of dismantling and decontamination activities.",
            "“Coupling BIM with GPS or location-aware Wifi networks enables the deployment of semi- or fully autonomous robotics systems and drones,” said Hannes Hanggi of the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate, who helped lead the IAEA project. “They have the potential to significantly lower costs, further increase safety and enhance performance in decommissioning projects.”",
            "Lessons from Chornobyl and Fukushima",
            "how the Chornobyl and Fukushima accidents had influenced the use of robotic technology in  decommissioning. “In Ukraine, some years after the accident at unit 4 of the Chornobyl NPP in April 1986, research and development activity was carried out to develop a number of robotic techniques to be used for different purposes inside the damaged facility,” she noted. “Due to high exposure doses inside and the concentration of radioactive aerosols, an approach employing robotic techniques seemed very promising, for example, for characterisation of the premises and sampling of radioactive materials. It would mitigate doses for workers involved in stabilisation of the situation at the destroyed unit and help in planning further actions.”",
            "However, it soon became clear that there were challenges. Robots could not move due to the difficult configuration of surfaces – a lot of construction debris and no space for movement – and the extremely high exposure doses affected the electronic devices. Kilochytska added: “In cases where robotic devices stopped working or were stuck somewhere inside the unit, it was very difficult and sometime dangerous to bring them back. Some examples of these robots are still stored at Chornobyl.”",
            "Nevertheless, the use of robotic devices is now planned for use at Fukushima in Japan. Key to the development of robots for use at Fukushima is the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) that was created as a matter of urgency in 2013 to upgrade and develop decommissioning technology for the Fukushima Daiichi NPP. This has included development, testing and use of a range of robots for different purposes (see box).",
            "In addition, US-based Jacobs, for instance, has designed and built a robotic tool to obtain crucial information about the damaged reactor. It will collect pebble-like debris from the bottom of the containment vessel. A prototype passed extremely demanding factory acceptance and performance tests from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), which is leading the project. It is expected that a radiation resistant version will be built for deployment. “This is a prime example of how we are combining innovative engineering and deep nuclear knowledge to help decommissioning agencies meet the challenge of transforming legacy sites into a safe end state,” said Jacobs Energy, Security & Technology Senior Vice President Karen Wiemelt.",
            "The robot had to be small enough to enter the damaged containment vessel and pick up sand and pebbles up to 10mm in size by deploying a bucket-style retrieval device.",
            "The exact nature of the debris is currently unknown, and examination of the retrieved debris samples will provide crucial data for the next steps in decommissioning.",
            "Trials have shown that a remote operator, guided by images from a built-in camera, will need no more than eight minutes to insert the device into the containment vessel and retrieve debris samples, thus minimising the impact of radiation damage on the device.",
            "“The government of Japan and Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) plan to conduct test retrieval of fuel debris from inside the unit 2 reactor of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP by the end of 2022,” Kilochytska said. “To this end, TEPCO has been working with the UK to build a robotic arm, which has already arrived in Japan. The robotic arm is currently undergoing evaluation testing, and as soon as that is completed, it will be placed in a mock-up facility for debris retrieval training. In addition, various remote-control devices are being used to monitor the situation in high-dose areas such as inside nuclear reactors.”",
            "Retrieving fuel debris is the most challenging part of decommissioning efforts at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, according to Tadahiro Washiya of the Division of Fuel Debris Handling, Collaborative Laboratories for Advanced Decommissioning Science (CLADS) at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. “An investigation of the damaged unit 1 [F1] was carried out by robots and remote inspection tools; however, there are many uncertainties in understanding the conditions of the fuel debris,” including its composition and mechanical properties, Washiya said.",
            "Knowledge gained from the 1986 accident at Chornobyl is already supporting efforts at Fukushima Daiichi, said Boris Burakov of the Khlopin Radium Institute in St Peterburg, Russia, which hosted a training seminar with Japanese experts using real Chornobyl fuel debris samples in October 2019. “The results of the material study of Chornobyl samples are very important for predicting the main properties of the fuel debris at Fukushima Daiichi F1,” as the fuel debris at both sites share several similarities, Burakov said. Similarities include lava-like materials, porous fuel produced by this lava contacting water and hot particles with fuel and corium matrices.",
            "New approaches to the use of robots",
            "With so many NPPs scheduled to close in the coming decades, the nuclear industry will need more professionals working in decommissioning. To attract new talent to the field, in 2020 the IAEA held a global crowdsourcing challenge that sought original concepts or project outlines from young people for advancing the decommissioning of nuclear facilities or environmental remediation of radiologically contaminated sites. Entries included characterisation toolkits, instruments for field measurements and collecting 3D radiation data, as well as robots and artificial intelligence.",
            "A total of 26 submissions from 12 countries were received and evaluated against criteria such as the level of innovation and creativity. Of the five best entries selected by the IAEA, several relied on robotics. For example, Zeni Anggraini from the National Nuclear Energy Agency of Indonesia (BATAN) led a team that came up with a concept of a robot for mapping and monitoring of contaminated areas. “So far, measuring of contamination has been limited to a small area and was done manually,” he said. “We want to make a robot that can be used to avoid potential radiation risks to staff. There needs to be a breakthrough in the method of radiation monitoring using robots to measure and visualise contamination in affected areas.”",
            "Another proposal featuring robots came from the USA. “With the nuclear industry growing, the need for new subject matter experts is in high demand. As technology increases throughout our lifetime so does the need for experts in these fields, for example robotics,” said Daniel Martin, a research assistant at the Florida International University in the USA, whose team’s proposal envisaged use of a robotic platform and artificial intelligence to aid in preventing defects before they occur in facilities to be dismantled.",
            "Meanwhile, Erin Holland, a PhD student from the University of Bristol in the UK, led a team that submitted a characterisation toolkit for accelerated decommissioning activities. “Nuclear robotics is a fast-growing discipline and physical demonstrations of advanced robotic systems help make nuclear decommissioning quicker and safer for human operators,” said Holland. He added: “The overall aim of this project is to make a legacy site, formerly used for uranium and thorium ore processing, safer for the civilians working there.”",
            "Sellafield, the UK’s largest nuclear site and the focus of its nuclear decommissioning efforts, is making increasing use of robots. Spot the robot dog made its debut on the Sellafield site in October 2021 with three days of successful trials and a shift within an active area. Sellafield’s remediation teams are leading Spot’s deployment for Sellafield Ltd, working with Cumbria-based engineering consultant Createc, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and its US manufacturers Boston Dynamics.",
            "Valuable information was collected through laser scanning and gamma radiation imaging using a system provided by Createc. The robot completed its work wearing a suit specially designed and manufactured at the UKAEA which protected it from any radioactive contamination.",
            "Chris Hope, remediation capability development manager, Sellafield Ltd said: “This was a really challenging task – we deployed Spot into a complex, cluttered, highly contaminated area with a mission to capture information. The quality of the data we captured is fantastic and will help us with our decommissioning and waste planning.”",
            "He added: “Until now, this type of survey has relied on our operators manually deploying equipment in hazardous environments wearing full protective equipment. This proves that Spot can help us take humans away from harm. This allows us to free up our workers to deliver other value adding work. The protective suit did its job too – the robot was monitored and cleared by our health physics team, and was able to leave the Sellafield site.”",
            "Elsewhere in the UK, this year saw Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) begin working with the Robotics and Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear (RAIN) Hub to develop a second-generation robot called Lyra. It includes a package of surveying measures including LIDAR, multiple angle cameras, radiation probes and the ability to take swabs using the manipulator arm.",
            "In February, the robot completed a survey of a 140-metre-long underfloor duct which runs under the central corridor between laboratories, providing useful information that will help decommissioning.",
            "“Now the characterisation survey is complete we have built up a very comprehensive picture of the duct, which will help us make informed decisions on how the duct should be decommissioned,” said DSRL Project Manager Jason Simpson.",
            "OC Robotics flexible snake-arm robot has been deployed to help decommission the Dragon reactor at Winfrith in the UK using its high-powered cutting laser. Passing through a narrow hole in the 3 metre-thick concrete around the core, it sliced through a 400mm diameter Purge Gas Pre-Cooler (PGPC) vessel attached to the reactor core. Developed by OC Robotics and TWI with R&D funding from the NDA, LaserSnake allowed the work to be carried out inside the existing radiation shielding, saving time and money.",
            "Magnox Senior Project Manager, Andy Philps said: “We believe this is the first time that laser-cutting technology has been deployed directly on the core of a nuclear reactor.”",
            "In 2021, Framatome confirmed the operation of robotic systems for handling and sorting high-dose waste components, paving the way for increasing automation.",
            "The Virtual Remote Robotics (VIRERO) project, funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research, develops technologies for dismantling and sorting high-dose operational wastes, post-conditioning of packaged radioactive waste, and radiological sorting for handling, storage and disposal. The VIRERO project is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.",
            "According to Kilochytska, for the time being, many remotely-controlled devices can be used for characterisation of surfaces during decommissioning, for dismantling structures, systems and components that may be radioactively contaminated. “Moreover, robotic techniques such as drones can investigate the radiological situation and measure levels of contamination inside the premises and rooms,” she told",
            ". “In this way, doses to workers can be avoided and time and money needed for conducting these actions, for example, characterisation or dismantling, can be decreased. Together with 3D modelling this makes it possible to create a full picture of a particular room or facility, making planning of further activities easier, taking into account dose rates and levels of contamination.”",
            "She noted some important points for the future use of robotic techniques. “First, it is necessary to assess real needs and potential benefits, taking into account a particular plan for decommissioning a particular facility. Usually, development of such techniques requires significant investment. In addition, the further use of devices requires maintenance costs to support operation and repairs, as needed, such as a qualified staff to do this.” She added that there may also be an issue with decontamination of such devices to make possible regular use. “All this should be considered in advance before any decision is taken about developing or buying devices.”",
            "It is clear that robotics and other digital tools are playing an increasingly important role in advancing nuclear decommissioning projects, not only by enabling experts to characterise environments and decommissioning challenges but also by improving their execution. As Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy, said: “Innovative digital technologies can provide crucial insights for the planning and implementation of decommissioning projects. They can provide support in decommissioning situations that are difficult or dangerous for human workers and can help ensure that projects are executed safely and effectively”.",

            "Many areas of the Fukushima Daiichi NPP are still too dangerous for humans to enter due to high radiation levels, and robots are being used to perform some of the decommissioning work. IRID has developed robots to investigate conditions inside the Primary Containment Vessels (PCVs) and the spread of fuel debris.",
            "Various types of robots have been introduced. Two of the earliest ones – Rosemary and Sakura – worked together inside the unit 1 reactor building inspecting radioactive sources. Both robots were developed by the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT) in Narashino. IRID (Hitachi-GE) later modified them to investigate dose rates inside the building.",
            "Rosemary is equipped with a gamma camera (N-Visage) made in the UK to detect radiation dosage rates. Rosemary operates this camera via a wireless system as it is not large enough to be equipped with communication cables. However, as wireless communication is difficult to maintain inside the building. Sakura supports Rosemary acting as a wireless transmission station.",
            "In 2014, MHI tested the MEISTeR (maintenance equipment integrated system of telecontrol) robot which subsequently completed decontamination work and concrete core sampling at units 1&2. MEISTeR is capable of concrete drilling, cutting of handrails and piping, removal of obstacles, decontamination, repair work, and so on. The core samples were collected using the core boring apparatus equipped on one of MEISTeR’s arms, and a chisel on the other.",
            "Also in 2014, a swimming robot and a crawling robot, both developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy performed condition checks and a flow detection survey inside the unit 2 torus room wall. The robot swam underwater, using a camera to inspect the penetration points and checking for flow using a tracer while the crawling robot measured and monitored the flow of the tracer using an ultrasonic sonar system.",
            "The following year surveys were conducted at the unit 1 PCV using two shape-changing robots developed by Hitachi-GE Nuclear Energy.",
            "Many modifications and improvements were made by the development team to enable the robots to withstand the high-radiation environment within the reactor. The shape-changing robot first takes on a tubular form to traverse narrow pipes in order to reach the inside of the containment vessel. Subsequently. to achieve stability, the robot forms a U-shape as it collects the necessary information about the conditions inside the containment vessel."

Under this new MOU, NuScale will support Fermi Energia as it conducts further analysis and considers deploying a NuScale VOYGR SMR power plant in Estonia to supply baseload energy by 2031.",
            "“Considering the geopolitics of today, this agreement builds upon the existing momentum and strong interest from the international community who are looking to NuScale’s SMR technology as the premier, flexible, and cost-competitive climate solution,” said John Hopkins, NuScale Power President and CEO. “NuScale looks forward to working with Fermi Energia as they evaluate how our SMRs can become a key component of Estonia’s energy future.”",
            "Kalev Kallemets, Fermi Energia CEO and co-founder said the advantage of the new generation of SMRs is clearly manifested in the case of Estonia. “They fit better into the electricity grid, are more flexible and economical to operate, and meet stricter safety requirements than the existing nuclear plants,” he noted. “Before choosing the most suitable technology for Estonia, we will conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate which of the small reactors that will become market-ready in the near future best meets Estonia's needs to produce CO2-free energy year-round, in any weather, at an affordable price.”",

            "Construction of a second NPP on the Irtysh River in the Kurchatov region is being considered, Kazakhstan’s Vice Minister of Energy Zhandos Nurmaganbetov told a press conference on 3 August. Both Lake Balkhash and the Irtysh River are suitable sites for a NPP, he noted, adding: “Lake Balkhash will be the location of the NPP in Kazakhstan.” He explained that, if Kazakhstan aims to achieve carbon neutrality, “then there is no other way out but to build several plants”. The Irtysh is certainly a promising site, he noted, and once construction of the first plant begins, “the question arises: how many nuclear plants there will be in Kazakhstan”. He said relevant discussions are underway and detailed information will be looked at by the end of the year or early in 2023.",
            "Energy Minister Bolat Akchulakov explained why the region of Lake Balkhash was chosen to host the NPP and gave assurances about safety noting that the experience of accidents at NPPs in Chernobyl and Fukushima had been taken into account. “In Kazakhstan, the situation is completely different and we will exclude such possibilities. Moreover, the technologies that are on the shortlist, all incorporate post-Fukushima upgrades. Therefore, we want to make it as safe as possible.” He added that the tectonics in the village of Ulken near Lake Balkhash are quite different from those at Fukushima.",
            "He noted that Kazakhstanis have little professional experience to work at nuclear power plants. “And for one station, we need about 2,000 permanent people. And these are not just workers, they must have detailed knowledge of nuclear and atomic physics. Therefore, at the first stage, we will agree that the station will be managed jointly with the licensor so that our personnel can gain the necessary experience,” he explained.",
            "President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, stated that the republic would “lose the entire economy” without the construction of a nuclear power plant and would lose its regional leadership. According to him, the country \"really needs clean nuclear power.\" He also instructed the government to intensify work to increase understanding of the importance of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan.",
            "Earlier, Energy Minister Akchulakov said that Kazakhstan would decide on the technology for the construction of a nuclear power plant at the end of 2022 or early 2023. At the end of June, Kazakhstan excluded the US and Japan from its original list of potential technology suppliers on the grounds that there was no experience in the construction and operation of the proposed reactors.",

The Ministry noted that for the first NPP, only time-tested large-scale reactor technologies with existing operating experience were being considered.",
            "Timur Zhantikin, General Director of Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants, confirmed that four technologies were being considered: KHNP (South Korea) with APR-1000, APR-1400 reactors; CNNC (China) with HPR-1000, CNP-600+ reactors; Rosatom (Russia) with VVER-1200, VVER-1000 reactors; and EDF (France) with the ATMEA1 reactor.",
            "Kazakhstan and Rosatom at the beginning of this year signed a memorandum of cooperation on training personnel in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Also, a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy development was signed by Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants and KHNP in June.",
            "According to the Energy Ministry, construction of one NPP would take up to 10 years, and the cost on average $5 billion. In the forecast energy balance of Kazakhstan to 2035, one of the options is the commissioning of NPPs with a total capacity of 2.4GWe. Kazakhstan ranks first in the world in the production of natural uranium and has its own facility producing nuclear fuel."

            "In 2021 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300 SMR was selected by Ontario Power Generation (OPG) for deployment at Darlington, where it says Canada's first commercial, grid-scale, SMR could be completed as soon as 2028. TVA has not yet specified a technology for construction at Clinch River, but the company has been in discussions with GE Hitachi concerning the BWRX-300,",
            "TVA said this follows an April 2022 collaboration agreement with OPG to support the development of SMRs as an effective long-term source of 24/7 carbon-free energy in both Canada and the USA. It added: “Such collaborations could help reduce the financial risk that comes from development of innovative technology, as well as future deployment costs.”",
            "TVA reported $8.4 billion in total operating revenues on 118TWh of electricity sales for the nine months ended 30 June. Total operating revenues increased 14% compared with the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in fuel cost recovery revenue driven by higher fuel rates.",
            "Jeff Lyash, TVA president and CEO said: \"More than half of TVA's energy comes from carbon-free sources like nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewables, which provide a major source of price stability.\"",
            "He added: \"TVA recently issued an industry-leading request for proposal for 5,000MW of carbon-free energy to be available by 2029 and, knowing the critical role advanced nuclear technology will play in our nation's drive to decarbonisation, we signed a partnership with GE Hitachi to advance our pursuit of small modular reactor technology.\"",

Last Energy aims to develop 10 SMRs in the LSSE to fuel industrial activity. LSSE is home to more than 75 companies and over 16,000 jobs. The 10 power plants will deliver 200MW of capacity to the region.",
            "Last Energy said the agreement marks a significant step toward widespread SMR deployment, representing more than $1 billion in investment and more than $5 billion of electricity sales. Last Energy said its power plant uses a proven pressurised water reactor and fully modular plant design, which, it said, dramatically reduces the time and cost of plant construction. However, as yet the company has no prototype for its planned 20MWe SMR.",
            "In June, during the 590 Congress, Last Energy also announced an agreement with Poland’s Enea Group to pursue the development of Last Energy’s SMRs. “Poland is one of the first countries where Last Energy plans to implement our SMR technology,” said Damian Jamroz, General Manager of Last Energy Polska. “We’re glad that the Legnica Special Economic Zone has expressed its interest in locating one of the planned investments in their area, as well as the intention to sign a long-term contract for the energy produced. Now, we will begin the process of identifying potential locations.”",
            "LSSE President Przemysław Bożek noted: “Potential investors are increasingly faced with a lack of availability of energy and gas in the quantities they need. This project would allow for a safe, stable and emission-free source of energy for factories located in the Zone. We are taking another step not only towards green energy, but also to strengthen energy security.”",
            "Bret Kugelmass, founder and CEO of Last Energy, said: “Nuclear energy offers countries a powerful strategy to achieve both. Today’s agreement is a critical step toward bringing stable, reliable and cost-competitive energy to Poland, and establishing a much-needed model for how energy security and climate goals can align for the industrial sector.”",
            "The previous day, a letter of intent was signed between LSSE, Last Energy and DB Energy concerning participation in the construction and integration process in the Zone of the 10 SMRs and their operation for 24 years. Last Energy's offer covers the entire investment process – from the design concept, through design, arrangements, financing, implementation, service, maintenance and production of energy for the client, to the disposal of installations and fuel.",

Post-irradiation testing of the fuel is being carried out by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to help qualify it with the NRC. Westinghouse is testing a chromium-coated zirconium alloy cladding that is loaded with their ADOPT higher density uranium fuel pellets. The programme is receiving support from Idaho National Laboratory and ORNL to provide utilities with longer operation times, increased power outputs and higher fuel burnup. Lead test assemblies of EnCore ATF were also installed in Engie Electrabel's Doel unit 4 in Belgium in 2020.",

It uses a combination of iron, chromium and aluminium for its fuel cladding to improve the fuel’s behaviour under extremely high temperatures. The steel material is intended to have a lower oxidation rate when exposed to high temperature steam, improving the safety margins over zirconium cladding currently in use. GE is also testing a second fuel and cladding concept known as ARMOR. This coated zirconium cladding was developed outside of the DOE programme but is now an integral part of it. Southern Nuclear installed GE-Hitachi ATF fuel cladding technologies in 2018 at unit 1 of the Hatch NPP with samples discharged and shipped to ORNL for further testing in 2020.",

            "It is clear from this analysis that Russia plays a key role in many newcomer nuclear countries. The current conflict in Ukraine is certain to roll back Russia’s participation in the nuclear power programmes of NATO countries, even those with decades of experience using Soviet/Russian nuclear technology. However, for newcomer countries, and others in Central Asia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, this is unlikely to be a key factor in their technology choices. No other nuclear supplier offers such all-round support, including soft financing and BOO options. Russia takes a long view, committing to support that may last a century, sometimes begining with assistance in establishing nuclear research centres and research reactors. Extensive training is also provided as well as fuel supply, used fuel management services and decommissioning. So, while other suppliers, in particular the USA, are making rapid inroads in Europe, the rest of the world may still prefer to look to Moscow."
