            "‚ÄúWe have a generational opportunity in front of us, to change the way we use energy to live and work, that will lead to a cleaner environment, more economic growth and, most importantly, an affordable and secure energy supply,\" said New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs. ‚ÄúOur energy strategy balances addressing climate change with the growing energy needs and demands from all users in our province.‚Äù",
            "‚ÄúClimate change and the need to move away from greenhouse gas-emitting fuels are creating a global energy transition,‚Äù said Natural¬†Resources & Energy Development Minister Mike Holland. ‚ÄúOur actions will collectively reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2035, putting us well on our way to achieving a net-zero economy and creating new economic opportunities and prosperity for our province.‚Äù",
            "The strategy focuses on four areas: affordability, energy security & reliability, regulatory reform, and economic growth. It calls for;",
            "a significant increase in the use of renewable energy, such as wind and solar;",
            "more carbon-free baseload nuclear generation with small modular reactors (SMRs) to ensure the province‚Äôs energy grid has enough power to meet peak demand;",
            "developing new energy sources, such as hydrogen and biofuels; and increasing energy conservation and efficiency efforts.",
            "The strategy outlines how the energy landscape will transition, how the energy mix will change and the actions needed as well as the economic opportunities being created. It also looks at the impact the transition will have on how New Brunswickers think about and use energy. It outlines actions and requirements to meet federally regulated 2035 clean electricity and climate goals.¬†An energy transition working group will be established. It will engage with First Nations and key stakeholders to ensure their input is considered in the development of initiatives and plans.",
            "The strategy calls for the addition of 600 MWe of capacity at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generation Station by 2035, doubling New Brunswick's current nuclear capacity. The government says it will work with utility plant operator NB Power \"to enable the establishment of a partnership with another nuclear operator to improve performance, lower operational risk and lower cost\".¬†NB Power earlier this year published its own strategic plan highlighting the need to phase out coal by 2030 and achieve net-zero electricity supply by 2035.",
            "The roadmap included in the strategy report expects the first 150 MWe of SMR capacity to come online in 2030-2031, with another 450 MWe starting up in 2035. In July, NB Power, in partnership with SMR developer ARC Clean Technology Canada, submitted an environmental impact assessment registration document and an application for a site preparation licence for an SMR at Point Lepreau. The deployment of the ARC-100 sodium-cooled fast reactor in New Brunswick and is part of a joint strategic plan on SMR development and deployment released in 2022by the governments of Ontario, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Alberta.",
            "Higgs said his government will try to balance the cost of new energy sources with the ability for citizens to afford the expected additional expenses. He warned that it will be a \"difficult\" endeavour that will require help from Ottawa. \"Is it going to be easy? No it's not,\" he told a news conference. \"We have to balance affordability and the reliability, and ‚Ä¶ ensure that at the end of the day we don't put more and more hardship on the citizens to a point where they just can't afford to live and work in our province. Are we on a path to higher energy costs? Absolutely. I mean that path was set 10 years ago, I would say, by the federal government.\"",
            "Holland told the press conference that the province is familiar with the costs associated with wind and hydroelectricity, but said the cost for bringing SMRs up to the anticipated capacity remains unknown.",
            "\"We will be looking to the federal government to assist and join us in funding some of the projects, some of the research,\" he noted. Holland said the province will lean more heavily on energy from wind and small nuclear reactors to decarbonise its economy. The first SMR should be operational by 2031 and the second in 2035, he added.",
            "Opposition leaders described the energy plan as superficial. Green Leader David Coon said doubling the amount of nuclear capacity ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúmeans we‚Äôre going to double the debt, double the rates, because it is the most expensive form of electricity on the planet‚Äù. Liberal¬†Leader Susan Holt commended the government for bringing in a document that considers different sources of electricity but said it lacks specifics. ‚ÄúHalf of it was a review of the past and what was forward-looking was thin, short on details, short on figures, or any commitment to timeline,‚Äù she said."

            "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) ‚Äì Baltimore District has awarded a contract to decommission and dismantle the SM-1A Reactor Facility to Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning (A3D). The standalone C-contract contract estimated to be worth $95.5m over six years will integrate and leverage proven new technologies to dispose of both hazardous and radioactive materials.",
            "Amentum, based in Virginia, is a global engineering, project management and solutions integration company. APTIM, based in Louisiana, specialises in environmental services, resilience, sustainability, and energy solutions, as well as technical and data solutions, programme management, and critical infrastructure.",
            "A3D won the contract after protesting against an earlier decision to award it to Westinghouse. In August 2022, USACE awarded a $103m to Westinghouse Government Services (WGS) for the work.",
            "However, A3D alleged that USACE had misevaluated the WGS proposal and also failed to engage in adequate, equal discussions with the company. In April, the US Government Accountability Office partially upheld the protest and recommended that USACE ‚Äúeliminate WGS from further consideration for award and make award to one of the remaining firms in the competition, if otherwise proper.‚Äù Alternatively, USACE could reopen discussions among the competitors; solicit, obtain and evaluate revised proposals as the basis for its decision. A3D won the contract after lowering its original bid of $133.5m.",
            "‚ÄúAs a global leader in environmental solutions, our experience in nuclear remediation is extensive,‚Äù said, of Amentum‚Äôs National Security Group President Mark Whitney said Amentum will provide USACE with ‚Äúadvanced engineering capabilities and solutions that have been successful at some of the most challenging environmental cleanup projects in the world‚Äù.",
            "David Lowe, Senior Vice President of APTIM‚Äôs Nuclear Decommissioning business unit, said, APTIM has a long history of supporting USACE and the Army Reactor Office (ARO) in decontamination and decommissioning projects. ‚ÄúOur extensive experience performing reactor decommissioning projects for USACE and the ARO enables us to bring advanced innovations and solutions to complete the work safely and effectively at Fort Greely,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúWe will partner with USACE , regulators, and community stakeholders to eliminate the environmental liabilities of this legacy, ageing nuclear facility.‚Äù",
            "Other members of A3D‚Äôs team include Heritage ‚Äì M2C1 Joint Venture, a HUBZone small business location in Delta Junction, Alaska; Lynden Logistics; Brice Environmental; Oak Ridge Technologies; ReNuke Services; AECOM Technical Services; and Delta Junction Medical.",
            "Under this new contract, the work will be performed at Fort Greely, Alaska and will include planning, permitting, and engineering, site preparation, demolition and disposal of facilities and components from the defuelled nuclear reactor, related wells and utility corridors, and other ancillary facilities. The contract also includes remediation of contaminated soils, a final status survey, and site restoration.",
            "The SM-1A reactor achieved criticality in 1962 and was shut down in March of 1972, followed by the removal and disposition of the used fuel in 1973. The primary mission of the single-loop, 20.2 megawatt-thermal pressurized water reactor was to establish a cold-weather nuclear power plant to support power to Fort Greely, with a secondary mission to study the economics of operating a nuclear electric power plant as compared to operating a conventional oil-fired system in a remote location.",
            "SM-1A was built between 1958 and 1962, and operated from 1962 to 1972. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). 1A designates it as the first field plant of its type. It was designed to be used as an ‚Äúin-service‚Äù test facility in an Arctic environment with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam for the utility systems at Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear-type electrical plant in a remote area where fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "The final shutdown in March 1972 was in accordance with the SM-1A Decommissioning Plan approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health & Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the highly enriched uranium dioxide nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapour container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected to minimise costs and personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was deferred until radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced. In 1995, Fort Greely was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure list (BRAC) under which certain areas were investigated and remediated. The base was then removed from the BRAC list and remained open to support critical Army missions.",
            "The decommissioning strategy developed in the 1970s recommended that the deactivated reactors should be placed into a safe storage mode to allow the shorter-lived radionuclides to decay. Delaying decommissioning was expected to reduce radioactive waste volumes and worker exposures. However, preliminary studies indicated that the levels of contamination present within the reactors would not be reduced by decay sufficiently to allow for release of the facilities without significant decontamination. Additionally, concern regarding the increasing cost and decreasing availability of radioactive waste disposal led the Army Reactor Office (ARO) to reassess disposal options.",
            "USACE developed a management plan for conducting an All Hazards Assessment, which contained provisions for four phases of work. Phase I included a Historical Records Review & Disposal Alternatives Investigation. Phase II included performing a characterisation survey and decommissioning cost estimate, which was completed in 2015. Phases III and IV deal with decommissioning planning, design, and execution. Decommissioning Planning has been completed and USACE has received a Decommissioning Permit from ARO.",
            "The remaining materials that have been entombed in concrete or safely stored onsite will now be removed as part of the contract with A3D. An on-site kick-off meeting at Fort Greely will take place in late October, paving the way for our preparatory work at the site. The team is targeting a full mobilisation to the site by mid-2024. Project completion is currently anticipated by 2029. The site will then be released to the Garrison for future use.",

            "US power utility Southern Company, TerraPower and Core Power have started pumped-salt operations in the Integrated Effects Test (IET), as a step towards development of Generation-IV molten salt reactor technology, namely TerraPower‚Äôs first-of-a-kind Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR).",
            "Since installation of the IET at TerraPower‚Äôs laboratory in Everett, Washington in October 2022, the project team has completed mechanical, electrical and controls verification and commissioned all systems. The IET is a non-nuclear, externally heated, up to 1 MW multi-loop system ‚Äì the world‚Äôs largest chloride salt system developed by the nuclear sector ‚Äì and follows years of separate effects testing. The IET aims to inform the design, licensing and operation of an approximately 180 MW MCFR demonstration planned for the early 2030s.",
            "The project was initiated by Southern Company and TerraPower under the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC-15) award, a multi-year effort to promote the design, construction and operation of Generation-IV nuclear reactors. ARC-15 involves a total project investment of $76m based on a 60-40% public-private cost share.",
            "The project team also includes US and UK-based Core Power is a formed in 2018 to build marine-appropriate reactor plants, the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Vanderbilt University. The IET also supports the development and operation of the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment at INL, a proof-of-concept critical fast-spectrum salt reactor. At less than 200 kW, the reactor will provide experimental and operational data.",
            "Commissioning of the IET employed hot argon and chloride salts to confirm readiness, including filling and flushing of drain tanks and verifying operation of freeze valves ‚Äì a unique and important component for salt systems. Chloride salt has now been loaded into the primary coolant salt loops and pumped-salt operations have begun. A multi-month test campaign will provide valuable salt operations data and know-how for the MCFR programme.",
            "‚ÄúSouthern Company believes the next generation of nuclear power holds promise in providing an affordable and sustainable net-zero future that includes reliable, resilient and dispatchable clean energy for customers,‚Äù said Dr Mark S Berry, Southern Company Services Senior Vice President of Research & Development. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exciting to see each new landmark in the Integrated Effects Test, as it helps our nation rebuild lost molten salt reactor knowledge.‚Äù",
            "Jeff Latkowski, Senior Vice President for the MCFR said: ‚ÄúThe Molten Chloride Fast Reactor has the potential to meet the carbon-free needs of hard-to-decarbonise industrial sectors including and beyond electricity. The IET will help us gather and evaluate data to support the development of our technology, and we are excited to launch pumped-salt operations.‚Äù",
            "Mikal B√∏e, President and CEO of Core Power described the start-up of the IET as ‚Äúa milestone achievement in the development of the first fast-spectrum molten salt reactor‚Äù. He added that the IET ‚Äúallows us to collect that crucial last-mile data for a design and build of the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor and takes the team one step closer to a genuinely unique way to do new nuclear that is appropriate for the commercial marine environment‚Äù.",
            "TerraPower's MCFR technology uses molten chloride salt as both reactor coolant and fuel, which enables fast spectrum operation at higher temperatures than conventional reactors, generating electricity more efficiently. It also offers potential for process heat applications and thermal storage. A version of the MCFR ‚Äì the m-MSR ‚Äì is being developed for marine use. TerraPower is also developing Natrium technology ‚Äì featuring a sodium fast reactor combined with a molten salt energy storage system ‚Äì with a demonstration plant planned to be built at Kemmerer in Wyoming.",

            "Canada‚Äôs provincial government of Alberta will invest CAD7m ($5.1m) into a study by oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy on how small modular reactors (SMRs) could be used for future oilsands operations. Rebecca Schulz,¬†Alberta‚Äôs Minister of Environment & Protected Areas, told a news conference at the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary that this is ‚Äújust another example of how industry dollars are being reinvested back into industry to support innovation in emissions reduction‚Äù.",
            "Schulz, was joined by Justin Riemer, CEO of Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), and Laura Kilcrease, CEO of Alberta Innovates. ERA‚Äôs Technology Innovation & Emissions Reduction (TIER) fund is financing the project. According to Cenovus, the study will take several years and cost a total of CAD26m. It will focus on the feasibility of using nuclear power as an energy source to power the steam assisted gravity drainage process (SAGD) at oilsands.",
            "Rhona DelFrari, Chief Sustainability Officer & Executive Vice President of Stakeholder Engagement at Cenovus explained:",
            "‚ÄúYou use steam to inject it deep underground to loosen the oil so that you can pump it up.‚Äù Almost all of the emissions created in this type of oil sands facility are from boiling water, she continued. ‚ÄúSo you would be eliminating the emissions because you‚Äôre eliminating the burning of natural gas to oil, the water to create the steam.‚Äù",
            "However, she clarified that this would only eliminate emissions from operations, not consumption of the end product.",
            "Much of Canada‚Äôs anticipated future oil production is expected to come from SAGD. The process currently uses large quantities of natural gas, available in situ, which produces considerable carbon dioxide emissions. Additional applications of nuclear power could include energy for oil sands operations generally speaking, as well as creating hydrogen from natural gas to then upgrade bitumen into synthetic crude, also known as syncrude.",
            "The Cenovus study will build on an early-stage feasibility study prepared by Hatch Ltd for Alberta Innovates, Cenovus and TC Energy and published in August. This looked at the use of SMRs in steam-assisted gravity drainage operations in oilsands",
            "In 2021 Alberta joined New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan in signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on SMR development. Alberta has since signed MOUs with several SMR developers including ARC Clean Technology, X-Energy and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.",
            "Schulz noted: \"A few years ago, the idea of expanding nuclear energy use was on the back burner ‚Äì that is no longer the case. In Alberta, small modular nuclear reactors have the potential to supply heat and power to the oil sands, simultaneously reducing emissions and supporting Alberta's energy future. This funding is the foundation for that promising future.\"",
            "ERA CEO Justin Riemer said SMRs have \"great potential\" to supply non-emitting energy in many different applications. He added that more studies are needed to see if the technology is suitable for those industrial applications. ‚ÄúIf so, it could be transformational for the in-situ oil sands sector and other sectors in Alberta,\" he said.",
            "The adoption of SMR technology in Alberta ‚Äì which does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity ‚Äì would require an extensive regulatory and engagement process, but Shultz said the province is working to ensure the regulatory framework is in place and ready if private industry decides to pursue the technology.",
            "A working group on emissions reductions set up by the government of Alberta and the Canadian federal government has agreed to begin development of a regulatory framework for SMR technology.",
            "According to Warren Mabee, Director of the Institute for Energy & Environmental Policy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, there are still many unknowns with respect to the costs and efficiencies of SMRs but added that linking SMR technology to oilsands production may raise questions about whether it would be better used for other applications. However, he conceded that SMRs could start addressing the very high emissions associated with some oilsands operations. ‚ÄúThat's a good starting point, I think,\" he noted.",
            "Environmentalists are not so sure. Greenpeace Canada suggested that the push for SMRs is a \"delay tactic\" from the oil and gas industry. \"Cenovus is one of the wealthiest companies in the country, and they can certainly pay for their own research,\" said Greenpeace Canada spokesperson Keith Stewart. \"The notion that taxpayers are footing the bill for them to promise to do something a decade away from now is a real waste of resources that could be going into putting in solutions like renewable energy.\"",
            "According to Dr Paul Dorfman, chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group and visiting fellow with the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex in the UK: ‚ÄúNuclear is the weapon of choice for big oil.‚Äù Noting the long lead time to develop and regulate SMRs, they may be advantageous to the oil industry, which can continue producing during the extended regulatory and research and development periods.",
            "A similar sentiment was expressed by Julia Levin, Associate Director of National Climate at Canada‚Äôs Environmental Defence organisation. ‚ÄúThis is another public handout from the Government of Alberta to an extremely profitable company,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSMRs appeal to oil and gas companies as a way to delay the energy transition, given how speculative the technology is.‚Äù",

        "text": [
            "The decommissioning of a mothballed NPP at Fort Greely in Alaska is expected to resume after the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) resolved a contract dispute that had delayed work for more than a year. The final phase of decommissioning and dismantling the SM-1A heat and power plant has been on hold since 2022 after a company competing for the contract filed protests over handling of the bid proposals.",
            "In August 2022, USACE awarded a $103m contract to South Carolina-based Westinghouse Government Services. However, officials for competing firm, Louisiana-based Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning (A3D) appealed against the decision to the federal General Accounting Office (GAO). USACE was directed by GAO to reopen discussions with the competing companies and to re-evaluate the bid proposals.",
            "‚ÄúWe ultimately made the decision to reverse the award, based on our re-evaluation of proposals,‚Äù said USACE project manager Brenda Barber. ‚ÄúSo the award is going to Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning, and the Westinghouse Government Services contract has been terminated.‚Äù Barber said that when USACE allowed the competing companies to submit final proposals, A3D lowered its bid for the contract to $95.3m. ‚ÄúAnd it was deemed to be fair (and) reasonable, and resulted in an award to them,‚Äù she said.",
            "The SM-1A was a field prototype of a medium-sized nuclear reactor developed by the Army during the Cold War for use at remote military installations. It generated 20 MWt for steam heat and 1.8 MWe. All of the fuel in the reactor core has been removed along with highly activated control and absorber rods. All of the solid waste around the reactor was packaged up and shipped to waste-disposal facilities in other US states.",
            "Some of the plant‚Äôs primary system components, including the reactor and its pressure vessel and coolant pumps, were entombed inside the facility. They were either kept in place, or cut off and placed in the bottom of the tall vapour containment building before being grouted and concreted.",
            "SM-1A was built between 1958 and 1962, and operated from 1962 to 1972. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). 1A designates it as the first field plant of its type. It was designed to be used as an ‚Äúin-service‚Äù test facility in an Arctic environment with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam for the utility systems at Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear-type electrical plant in a remote area where fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "The final shutdown in March 1972 was in accordance with the SM-1A Decommissioning Plan approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health & Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the highly enriched uranium dioxide nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapour container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected to minimise costs and personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was deferred until radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced. In 1995, Fort Greely was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure list (BRAC) under which certain areas were investigated and remediated. The base was then removed from the BRAC list and remained open to support critical Army missions.",
            "The decommissioning strategy developed in the 1970s recommended that the deactivated reactors should be placed into a safe storage mode to allow the shorter-lived radionuclides to decay. Delaying decommissioning was expected to reduce radioactive waste volumes and worker exposures. However, preliminary studies indicated that the levels of contamination present within the reactors would not be reduced by decay sufficiently to allow for release of the facilities without significant decontamination. Additionally, concern regarding the increasing cost and decreasing availability of radioactive waste disposal led the Army Reactor Office (ARO) to reassess disposal options.",
            "USACE developed a management plan for conducting an All Hazards Assessment, which contained provisions for four phases of work. Phase I included a Historical Records Review & Disposal Alternatives Investigation. Phase II included performing a characterisation survey and decommissioning cost estimate, which was completed in 2015. Phases III and IV deal with decommissioning planning, design, and execution. Decommissioning Planning has been completed and USACE has received a Decommissioning Permit from ARO. The total estimate for decommissioning is $243m including estimated costs to implement the project and USACE oversight USACE expects decommissioning efforts at the site to be completed by 2029. The site will then be released to the Garrison for future use.",
            "The remaining materials that have been entombed in concrete or safely stored onsite will now be removed as part of the contract with A3D. As to the contract dispute, KUAC quoted Barber as saying: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt typically comment too much on the protests just because of the sensitivity.‚Äù However, according to information on the GAO website, A3D argued that USACE misevaluated the Westinghouse proposal and also failed to engage in adequate, equal discussions with the firm. Westinghouse also failed to identify a retention plan to ensure key personnel would be available for the duration of the project.",
            "Barber said the re-evaluation has delayed the completion date of the project by a year. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre finalising some startup-related issues with respect to the contract now,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre hopeful that work on the site ‚Äì physical work on the site ‚Äì is probably still six to eight months out.‚Äù",

            "\"This mutual cooperation agreement was promoted to discuss the issue of applying SMART technology with almost no carbon emissions to supply necessary steam to oil sands (tar sands) mining areas in Alberta,\" KAERI said. \"Based on this agreement, the two sides plan to share in advance the information necessary to confirm the feasibility of SMART construction and further obtain licences.‚Äù",
            "Korean companies, including Hyundai Engineering, have already been promoting projects that utilise SMART technologies for Alberta oil sand mining, KAERI noted. ‚ÄúThis mutual cooperation agreement is expected to promote the activities of these companies.\"",
            "At the signing ceremony Dr Joo said ‚Äúit is time to translate the net-zero emission commitment into actions, and SMR technology is crucial in carbon reduction actions‚Äù. He added that deployment of SMART in Alberta would pioneer the battle against climate change. Minister Jean noted that the Government of Alberta ‚Äúis open to exploring all technologies, including SMRs, to help energy production thrive in a low-carbon future‚Äù. Through the agreement with KAERI, ‚Äúwe are continuing to explore deploying SMR technology and strengthening Alberta‚Äôs position as a world-leading responsible energy producer for years to come‚Äù. Minister Sawhney said he was excited about the potential for SMR technologies, such as KAERI‚Äôs.",
            "SMART is a 330 MWt pressurised water reactor with integral steam generators and advanced safety features with a 60-year design life and three-year refuelling cycle. The unit is intended to produce electricity (up to 100 MWe) as well as heat for thermal applications, such as seawater desalination. SMART received standard design approval from the Korean regulator in mid-2012 following completion of the basic design, and KAERI had planned to build a demonstration plant to begin operation in 2017. However, further development was delayed, in part because of a lack of orders for an initial reference unit. During their February visit to Korea, Jean and Sawhney visited KAERI's research facilities, including the SMART-ITL and SMART-MCR Simulator.",
            "Jean said: ‚ÄúAlberta is, and always will be, an energy powerhouse. Alberta‚Äôs government is committed to actively exploring opportunities to lower emissions while safely powering the world for decades to come. This MoU will allow us to build on the South Korean government‚Äôs interest in supporting safe and effective deployment of their SMR technology. It offers an opportunity to leverage new innovations to grow Alberta‚Äôs energy economy.‚Äù",
            "Invest Alberta, a Crown corporation of the Alberta Government, in March signed an MoU with ARC Clean Technology Canada to jointly pursue activities to support commercialisation of ARC's ARC-100 SMR technology in the province. That followed an MoU signed in January with X-Energy Canada to develop economic opportunities supporting the potential deployment of the Xe-100 SMR. It has also supported SMR developer Terrestrial Energy in its efforts to expand its operations into Alberta.",
            "The MoU with KAERI is effective for three years. Any SMR technology deployed in Alberta must meet Canadian safety requirements and would require an approved design and approved permitting for the reactor installation. SMART is one of only a few modular reactor technologies to have received design approvals from a nuclear regulatory agency."

        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. ‚ÄúWhile the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,‚Äù according to NEA. ‚ÄúRecent NEA analysis ‚Ä¶ finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.‚Äù",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development.

The first booklet in this series was first published in 2014 and serves as a supplement to the IAEA‚Äôs Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), an online database with comprehensive information on the latest developments in advanced reactors.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction to the latest edition: ‚ÄúSeveral major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020.

            "US-based X-energy recently completed a $40 million award with the US Department of Energy (DOE). The technology development project was instrumental in paving a path toward the company‚Äôs multi-billion-dollar demonstration project and the first US commercial facility to produce high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU)-based fuel for next-generation reactors.",
            "The company is currently developing a high-temperature gas reactor that is expected to be operational by 2028 supported by funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) through the newly established Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.",
            "X-energy received the Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC) award in 2015 to further develop its Xe-100 advanced reactor design and TRISO-X particle fuel. The six-year project resulted in X-energy completing the basic design of their Xe-100 reactor under the award and fabricating its first TRISO fuel pebbles using natural uranium at a pilot-scale fuel facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which was commissioned as part of the project.",
            "X-energy is now focusing on engagements with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to license the Xe-100 reactor design. X-energy is also seeking to license and operate first commercial facility dedicated to fuelling HALEU-based reactors in Tennessee as part of DOE‚Äôs Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",

            "‚ÄúThe Corps of Engineers has worked diligently to award the contract for this very complex and challenging project,‚Äù said Baltimore District Commander Col. Estee Pinchasin. ‚ÄúOur radiological experts have safely executed projects like this in the past, and our team of trained professionals will use proven techniques, precautions and engineering controls to prioritise and ensure the continued safety of our workers, installation community and public.\" Crews are expected to begin mobilising in 2023, and the work is anticipated to take approximately six years to complete.",
            "USACE Baltimore District has released the Final Notice of Availability (NOA), Final Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), and National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the proposed action to decommission and dismantle the SM-1A and to release the property for unrestricted use.",
            "The construction of SM-1A began in 1958 and first criticality was achieved in March 1962. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, in Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). The ‚Äú1A‚Äù notation designates it as the first field plant of its type.",
            "A 20.2-MWt pressurised water reactor, SM-1A was designed to be used as an ‚Äúin-service‚Äù test facility for nuclear power in an Arctic environment, with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam to Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear power plant in a remote area where conventional fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "By 1968, however, the decision was made to close the plant because of the high operating costs and the projected cost of replacing SM-1A‚Äôs reactor pressure vessel. The final shutdown was performed on the SM-1A Reactor in March 1972, in accordance with theSM-1A Decommissioning Plan as approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health and Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapor container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected due to the low initial cost and low personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was to take place at a time when radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced due to radioactive decay. The plant put in safe storage (SAFSTOR) condition.",
            "Because of SM-1A‚Äôs historical significance (the plant was found eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places), and because decommissioning will adversely affect the property, USACE signed a memorandum of agreement with the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office and the City of Delta Junction outlining how the history of SM-1A and its unique artic mission will be preserved.",
            "USACE said that ‚Äúwhen safe and feasible,‚Äù it will salvage historical items from the reactor facility. This includes informational safety plaques and an unopened time capsule. Also, within two years of awarding the decommissioning contract, USACE will develop a detailed plan for the identification, curation, storage, and transportation of SM-1A‚Äôs historical items.",
            "USACE is responsible for two other military reactors. The MH-1A was installed on the former World War II Liberty ship Sturgis, which became the world‚Äôs first floating NPP. Decommissioning of MH-1A was completed in 2019. The SM-1 in Virginiais in the process of being closed with a target date of 2025.",
