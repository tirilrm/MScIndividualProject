            "The agreement, announced by US principal deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation Ann Ganzer, is designed to advance the deployment of a US SMR in Ghana.",
            "In a statement the US embassy in Ghana said SMRs can provide 24/7 reliable power, complement other clean energy sources, have flexible siting requirements, and use a small land area.  ",
            "“US SMRs incorporate advanced safety features, including designs to withstand extreme weather and seismic events, and can be tailored to match the specific needs of a country’s power grid, with the ability to scale up as needed,” the statement said.",

            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",
            "“The reason behind this race toward nuclear is simple,” she said. “The world needs more power, and we need it sooner than projected.”",

            "Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Nuclear, the public body responsible for the delivery of new projects, told the Financial Times the UK would need “at least another couple” of large nuclear power stations after the two EPR plants currently under construction by French state-owned power company EDF at Hinkley Point C. ",
            "The French utility is also jointly developing plans with the British government to build a second station using the EPR design at Sizewell in Suffolk.",
            "But Bowen added that a pause was needed before the UK decided on what technology to use in those future large plants, which will form part of the country’s drive to meet its net zero goals. ",
            "“I think from a value-for-money perspective, we’ve got to pause and look and just check that we’ve got our strategy right,” he said. ",
            "Bowen said other technologies worth considering included Westinghouse’s AP1000 plant, which has already been through the UK regulatory process, as well as South Korea’s APR-1400 and Canadian Candu designs. He acknowledged that as the UK was building two EPR-based plants there was a good case for using the same design.",
            "In January, the UK government set out plans for what it claimed will be Britain’s biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years with the possible construction of about 11 new reactors by 2050 – enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand.",
            "Ministers published a roadmap that recommitted the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24 GW by 2050 – an increase from around 5.8 GW today.",
            "The government is also running a competition for companies to design and build small modular reactors. In October it selected six companies to advance to the next phase of the competition.

            "Under the MOU, project developer Prodigy and Des Nëdhé, an indigenous economic development corporation, will explore potential TNPP projects using microreactors including Westinghouse’s eVinci, a 5 MW unit that Westinghouse has said is the ideal technology for TNPPs.",

            "The Prodigy TNPP, which can integrate different types of microreactors, would be manufactured, outfitted, and partially commissioned in a shipyard, then transported to site for installation either on land or in a marine, shoreside setting. ",
            "The facility would require minimal site preparation when compared to a site-constructed small modular reactor (SMR). Since the TNPP would arrive at site more ready for final commissioning, power generation could begin in a matter of weeks. At the end of project life, the TNPP would be removed for decommissioning, eliminating legacy waste.",
            "Off-grid diesel replacement in Canada is a large opportunity, with most remote communities each requiring up to 5 MW, and remote mines from 15-45 MW. ",
            "Prodigy TNPPs would enable the deployment of microreactors safely and economically, even in hard-to-access locations such as those in the north of the country. ",
            "“Power generated would facilitate infrastructure improvements across the north, drive increased production of critical minerals, including those needed for transportation electrification, and increase opportunities for the long-term economic reconciliation of Indigenous Peoples,” a statement said.",
            "Prodigy is collaborating with Westinghouse to develop a TNPP outfitted with the Westinghouse eVinci microreactor, that would be suitable for these applications.",
            "Westinghouse and Prodigy signed an agreement in 2022 and have completed milestones for conceptual engineering and regulatory studies.",

            "Ahead of the first Nuclear Energy Summit (NES) in Brussels later this month, experts have looked at the challenges facing the commercialisation of small modular reactors in Europe and how to make new projects more competitive.",
            "“NES is a big and well attended event, so I am expecting that it will create political momentum and a lot of money will have to be mobilised,” said Yves Desbazeilles, director-general of the Brussels-based nucleareurope industry group at a webinar organised by the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI) in London on 12 March.",
            "“The event wants to create momentum beyond Europe”, he said. “Building the equivalent of 100 GW to 120 GW of new installed nuclear capacity is required in Europe, and SMRs will take a significant share of that.”",
            "NES, on 21 March, will be co-chaired by the prime minister of Belgium Alexander De Croo and the director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi. The IAEA said the summit will be the highest-level meeting to date exclusively focused on the topic of nuclear energy.",
            "NNWI chairman Tim Yeo told NucNet: “NES should aim to set a clear timetable for the expansion of nuclear energy capacity and commit to working to remove regulatory barriers to closer cooperation as quickly as possible.” ",
            "However, this global effort also demonstrates that Europe’s nuclear power industry and SMR deployment need to be better prepared for global competition.   ",
            "“The lack of available sites and project financing for first-of-a-kind are challenging, though their effects vary from one country to another as the UK, for example, has unwisely started a consultation about possible new sites for nuclear plants,” Yeo added.",
            "He said the consultation was a mistake because it will take years to reach a conclusion and the UK already has enough sites which are approved for nuclear construction.",
            "“Inviting proposals for new sites will make it much harder to develop the existing approved ones because objectors will argue that until all the possible alternative sites have been fully explored, none of the existing ones should be developed,” he said.",
            "The consequence of this unnecessary consultation is that no new SMRs will be built in the UK before at least half a dozen have been built elsewhere in Europe, according to Yeo.",
            "“Other countries are likely to avoid falling into this trap,” he added.",
            "“In those countries, a lack of project finance for first-of-a-kind SMRs may present a bigger challenge,” he said, noting that there is a real risk that the first SMR in Europe will not be deployed in the UK. Yeo cited as evidence comments to this effect by Rolls-Royce executives.",
            "Companies like France’s state utility and nuclear operator EDF have repeatedly called for SMRs to be developed as European rather than country specific projects, given the ongoing supply chain collaborations between Italy and France and beyond.",
            "“The creation of the European Industrial Alliance on SMRs opens up this possibility and it should be strongly encouraged,” said Yeo.",
            "“Potential supply chain companies may realise that Europe desperately needs to exploit first mover advantage to catch up with Russia, China and North America and see more benefits from cooperation than competition,” Yeo said.",
            "“It is essential that streamlining of the regulatory regime for new European SMR projects is in place as soon as possible to support deployment, thus helping to achieve [the EU’s and global] net zero targets,” according to Yeo.",
            "“The EIB’s [European Investment Bank] recent announcement to invest in nuclear power is very welcome and reflects a significant change of tack from the policy adopted by the outgoing EIB president”, Yeo said. “Active support for investment in nuclear will encourage private investors.”",

            "A recent report by UK-based consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, SMR nuclear market update 2024, illustrates the scale of the effort needed for new investment as “the global nuclear SMR project pipeline expands to 22 GW, increasing more than 65% since 2021”.",
            "This expansion requires investment equivalent to $176bn (€160bn), while the uranium supply remains a challenge along with policy support, which is crucial to accelerating projects to final investment decisions, said the report.",
            "“While the sector has faced a range of challenges over the last 12 months, especially the cancellation of NuScale’s clean power project, multiple markets across the world are expanding their focus on nuclear SMRs,” said David Brown, director, energy transition service at Wood Mackenzie.",

            "DESNZ expects to receive bids this month into SMR tender from shortlisted companies   ",
            "The UK government is planning to play a larger role in the country’s nuclear power industry in order to offset uncertainties in the energy market, Chris Heffer, the director of nuclear power at the country’s department of energy security and net zero (DESNZ), said at an industry event on 23 February.",
            "Heffer cited as evidence of this commitment the government’s investment of around €4.10bn (£3.50bn, $4.45bn) in the planned 3,260-MW Sizewell C nuclear plant in eastern England, the ongoing competition organized by DESNZ to select at least one small modular reactor (SMR) design for deployment in the UK by the early 2030s and investment through the government’s future nuclear enabling fund (FNEF) in enhancing fuel fabrication and uranium conversion capacity in the UK.",
            "Sizewell C is currently 51% owned by the UK government and 49% owned by French state nuclear power company EDF. The plant will comprise two 1.6-GW French EPR reactors and be built on a site adjacent to the existing 1,250-MW Sizewell B pressurised water reactor (PWR), the only PWR in the UK.  ",
            "Heffer said that “We expect a Final Investment Decision (FID) on Sizewell C by the end of this year,” adding that the country already had a “fuel manufacturing and production site in Springfields” outside Preston in northern England, owned by Westinghouse, where the government had already invested €15, 2 million (£13 million) from the FNEF to help develop uranium conversion capacity at the Springfields facility.",
            "Heffer added that the creation of the Great British Nuclear (GBN) government-owned entity to oversee the SMR competition and the government’s investment in Sizewell C demonstrate “a stronger role for the government in the UK nuclear sector. Energy security is also security for the UK.”",
            "He also said that “building a coherent system is the UK government approach [to the nuclear energy industry] rather than bits here and there.”",
            "He implied that currently the UK has got a system with bits here and there unlike the French one, but this is now changing. ",
            "Heffer also noted that high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) would be an “important addition to the market and that there are some [important] commercial or technological decisions” to soon be made on Haleu.",
            "Speaking during the same event on 23 February, Guy Esnouf, GBN’s director of communications, said that GBN has a “role on the planning, regulations and siting” of SMRs in the UK, through its oversight of the SMR competition. ",
            "Esnouf also said that GBN was “putting the contract together” to select at least one SMR design for deployment in the UK, and that GBN would also “set up development companies” to establish and construct SMRs in the UK, using the designs selected in the competition. ",
            "He added that the UK government and GBN hoped that an FID would be made on the first SMR to be deployed in the UK by 2029. ",
            "“The key timeline is FID by the end of 2029, that is really important, this is urgent,” Esnouf said. ",
            "GBN is working on SMR siting “during the first half of 2024, we will look to find and purchase sites or the reactor developers will develop their own sites. We are looking at sites and are focused on areas with nuclear experience,” Esnouf noted. ",
            "GBN would “look to place at least one or two SMRs at sites” that it selected for deployment, but GBN and the UK government really “want to build a fleet of SMRs” according to Esnouf. ",
            "“We need to take advantage of modularity to get quicker and more reliable development” of SMRs, Esnouf also said. ",
            "“We need to learn how to build a fleet and need to go beyond one or two sites,” he added. ",
            "In the second half of last year, the UK government has selected six SMR companies to continue to the next phase of a competition to design and build small modular reactors.",
            "These companies include EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. ",
            "The next bid expected, but not confirmed, as early as end of this month will secure the second round of the pre-selection process. ",
            "The DESNZ had said at the first selection round that the designs were “the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s”.",
            "The UK wants new nuclear to play role in its future net-zero energy transition as its ageing reactor fleet is preparing for retirement over the next decade."

            " Countries in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects will be likely to “double down their scrutiny” of small modular reactor offers following the cancellation of NuScale’s agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) for a Voygr SMR project in Idaho.",
            "Writing in his Neutron Bytes blog, nuclear energy analyst Dan Yurman said the lack of cost competitiveness of the NuScale Uamps project will have implications for US-based NuScale’s export opportunities for its Voygr technology in Romania, Poland, and Indonesia. ",
            "All three countries are price sensitive and are likely to closely assess offerings from NuScale and for every other developer of SMRs, for both light-water reactor and advanced designs, seeking export sales, Yurman wrote.",
            "“Other countries, like Estonia and the Philippines, which are in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects, will also likely be doubling down their scrutiny of SMR offers. ",
            "“The key competition in all of these countries will come from the price of natural gas used to generate electricity and time to deliver a gas plant v. building an SMR.”",
            "Yurman said the Uamps project was heavily subsidised by the US government in the form of $1.35bn (€1.24bn) in cash to make the first-of-a-kind new build affordable. ",
            "“However, until global inflationary pressures abate, no commercial customer in the Philippines, Poland, or anywhere else is likely to commit to multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures for multiple SMRs without the host domestic government providing financial and rate guarantees for the project,” the blog said.",
            "He said unless the US commits to major levels of export financing for SMRs, like the levels of commitment South Korea and Japan have shown over the years for full size reactors, all US SMR developers will be at a financial disadvantage to Russia and China when they eventually bring their SMRs to market. ",
            "“NuScale’s business decisions that led to the Uamps contract contain a number of missteps that can be avoided in future deals,” Yurman said.",
            "“NuScale should have sought as its first customer a utility with an operating nuclear reactor that would have a management team with the know-how to handle a new nuclear project.",
            "This “onsite strategy” would accrue significant cost savings with a switchyard and grid connection in place with a well-defined service area facing growing demand for power. Local and regional transportation networks, including rail, would have been available. Recruitment of skilled trades to build the plant and access to supply chains would be easier.",
            "Several other SMR developers are mindful of this issue. GE-Hitachi has plans to build multiple units of its BWRX-300 SMR at TVA’s Clinch River site in Tennessee and at OPG’s Darlington nuclear site in Canada. X-Energy announced its first advanced small modular reactor site near the Columbia nuclear power station in Washington state.",
            "NuScale, the first company with US approval for an SMR design, cancelled the Uamps project in November 2023. A statement at the time said it was unlikely the project would have enough subscription from power purchasers to continue towards deployment.",

            "An overall roadmap – which could come as soon 4 January – is needed to determine the next steps for new nuclear construction in the UK, including small modular reactors, an EDF executive said at a London industry conference. ",
            "The nuclear power industry is seeing growing demand for a strategic European approach, including in the UK, to enable SMR projects at different stages of development to get off the ground.  ",
            "Anne Falchi, head of strategy, nuclear new build, at EDF said: “I believe in a European SMR, as Europe has the ambition of having 150 GW of capacity by 2050, so effectively we will need to build 120 GW of nuclear capacity in Europe by 2050.” ",
            "“EDF knows well the UK’s capabilities, therefore we will need to identify new UK sites, so these activities can be localised”, she added.  ",
            "“Great British Nuclear [GBN] is looking in the right direction in relation to UK SMR deployment, and EDF has the experience of working with around 100 UK companies,” according to Falchi. “Namely, GBN has a very clear roadmap within Europe for its SMRs,” she said. ",
            "“We need a lot of large nuclear reactors. I do not believe in a UK or a French supply chain, but a European supply chain, so the UK needs to figure out what it is best at”, she added. ",
            "“We have EU partners to bring together the best capabilities, so we are trying not to localise the supply chain. ",
            "EDF’s Nuward SMR subsidiary is looking to develop the Nuward SMR, consisting of two 170-MW SMRs combined to form a 340-MW SMR plant using two pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The Nuward design has been developed using France's extensive experience in PWRs. ",
            "Falchi said “EDF is looking forward to see an overall roadmap for nuclear power in the UK, so that the country can reach serial production of the same reactor.” Such a roadmap should also include information on the potential location of new units in the country, she added. ",
            "Realising the promise of SMRs is a priority, including the delivery, cost and use of UK made nuclear fuel, said Rory O'Neil, director of government affairs, Westinghouse UK. He added that “there will be a global supply chain” for SMRs.  ",
            "“SMR procurement and [SMR] competition work is GBN’s most high profile workstream, although I also have AMR [advanced nuclear reactor] responsibilities”, said Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN’s interim chief executive officer at the annual Nuclear Industry Association conference in London earlier this month. ",
            "She said that maximising the ability to put nuclear power on the grid is key, as well as the need to work with a future system operator. A further priority is “the use of regulation and creation of a system for modularisation”, of new nuclear units, she added. “The nuclear roadmap, which is expected in January 2024, is built on specific points,” she said. ",
            "GBN is also planning to publish documents about siting principles and routes to markets, along with the nuclear roadmap. ",
            "EDF is competing with other developers to build SMRs in the UK, although the company has the advantage of being an established player and investor in the UK nuclear power market. ",
            "EDF has been selected by the UK government to participate in the next stage of the competition to develop one or more SMR designs in the UK, alongside GE-Hitachi, Holtec Britain, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse. ",
            "Renaud Crassous, Nuward’s president, has said in a press interview that the aim of the Nuward reactor design is to “fully integrate catalysts for success” of this SMR design, such as innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production, thus speeding the start of the construction of the first SMR. ",
            "The French nuclear safety regulator, as well as the Czech and Finnish regulators, are now collaborating for a pilot European early joint regulatory review of the Nuward design. EDF is cooperating with Italian companies on SMR development to achieve a standard for the European market.  ",
            "EDF, which holds the majority ownership of the Italian energy company Edison, signed a letter of intent earlier this year with Italy's Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo Nucleare and Edison to assess potential industrial cooperation for the development of nuclear power in Europe, especially SMRs.",
            "According to the French SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a first SMR is scheduled to begin in 2026, while the construction of the first unit is expected to take around three years after first concrete is laid in 2030. ",
            "Industry insiders think that the European SMR market has a great potential if SMR designs are standardised and if the reactor developers receive a certain level of state funding. ",

            "Companies in Asian countries leading the way",
            "Innovation in nuclear fusion is seeing its sharpest rise in almost a decade, according to the latest patent data published by leading UK intellectual property firm, Appleyard Lees.",
            "The company’s Inside Green Innovation: Progress Report Third Edition – which analyses global patent filings across several key environmental issues, including nuclear power – shows a 50% year-on-year increase in patent filings, from 107 to 159, to 2021.",
            "Appleyard Lees said such innovation investment has not been seen in the sector since 2004-2005 and the start of the Millennium, with companies in Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and China leading the charge. ",
            "The findings come as 22 countries signed a pledge at Cop28 in Dubai to triple nuclear generation capacity by 2050 from a base year of 2020 at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai. This will involve inviting shareholders of international financial institutions to encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in lending policies.",
            "Appleyard Lees partner and patent attorney, Richard Bray said that while patent filings for nuclear fusion and fission peaked in the 1970s and 80s – falling significantly through the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s – data from 2021 shows the start of a potential upward trend in filing activity not seen since 2000-2001.",
            "“It will be interesting to see if this trend continues… and which companies are leading this renewed period of innovation and patent filing. It is an exciting time for the nuclear industry as a whole.”",
            "According to the Fusion Industry Association, investment in the fusion sector has now reached over $6bn globally, with at least $4.2bn (€3.8bn) invested in the last two years. The single, largest investment in fusion energy was $1.8bn to US-based fusion reactor developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in 2022. Commonwealth Fusion Systems now has total declared funding of more than $2bn. ",
            "Appleyard Lees said many companies receiving recent investment are targeting fusion power to grid by 2030. ",
            "It said the stand-out area of fusion innovation, as shown by the patent data, is in magnets and magnetic properties, essential components in existing fusion reactor designs. Since 2018, there has been an increase in new patent filings for high temperature superconductors – potentially seen as game changing for numerous industries. Prime movers include UK-based Tokamak Energy, with two-thirds of its patent applications covering this type of technology, and the Korean Electrotechnology Research Institute, which tops the list with 11 patent filings in 2021. ",
            "Innovation in nuclear fission is most visible in small modular reactors. Patent filings relating to this technology jumped by 100% from 2019-2020 (from 19 to 38) and fell only marginally in 2021. ",
            "“While the previous innovation spike in SMRs is attributed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident, the latest resurgence appears driven by interest in the microreactor concept, with offer smaller footprints than SMRs, and the capacity to produce up to 10 MW,” Appleyard Lees said.",
            "Notable patent filers in SMR and microreactors include large organisations such as Westinghouse, Korea Atomic Energy and Rolls-Royce. However, smaller companies – such as Nuscale and Terrapower, founded by Bill Gates – also appear in the list.",

            "The statement said that despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough subscription to continue toward deployment. ",
            "The move could be seen as a setback for SMR technology as efforts gather pace in the US and beyond to develop and deploy a new generation of reactors in a bid to reduce emissions and increase energy security.",
            "Salt Lake City-based Uamps supplies wholesale electric services to about 50 municipal utilities in the US West. The companies had said that Uamps members or other utilities needed to commit to buying 80% of the project’s power for it to be feasible. NuScale has agreed to pay Uamps a termination fee of $49.8m (€46.5m).",
            "“The customer made it clear we needed to reach 80%, and that was just not achievable,” NuScale chief executive officer John Hopkins said on a conference call Wednesday. “Once you’re on a dead horse, you dismount quickly. That’s where we are here.”",
            "Hopkins said NuScale will continue to progress the commercialisation of its technology with other existing and future customers.",
            "He said: “There remains an urgent need and increasing demand across the globe for advanced clean energy solutions based on cost-competitive, proven technology that can help meet climate goals while bolstering energy security. NuScale is ahead of the competition and best suited to fill that need.”",
            "The project was for the construction of a demonstration NuScale Voygr SMR power plant at the Idaho National Laboratory that was scheduled to be online in 2029.",

            "The report said the higher target price is due to a 75% increase in the estimated construction cost for the project, from $5.3bn to $9.3bn.",
            "Both NuScale and Uamps have attributed construction cost increases to inflationary pressure on the energy supply chain, particularly increases in the prices of the commodities that will be used in nuclear power plant construction.",

            "The CFPP was a major project for Uamps. It was initially planned as a 720-MW power plant comprised of 12 NuScale Voygr SMR power modules. As time progressed and member subscriptions for plant production lagged expectations, the project was scaled back to six modules with a combined capacity of 462 MW.",
            "“This decision is very disappointing given the years of pioneering hard work put into the CFPP by Uamps, CFPP, NuScale, US Department of Energy, and the Uamps member communities that took the leadership role to launch the CFPP,” said Uamps chief executive officer and general manager Mason Baker.",
            "“Yet, this decision is the best course for the Uamps members participating in the CFPP and doing what is best for those member communities will always be the guiding light in such decisions,” Baker said, noting that Uamps, NuScale, and the DOE are working on next steps to wind the project down.",
            "Earlier this year NuScale said the Voygr remained a competitive source of reliable, affordable and carbon-free power for customers.",
            "In August 2020, the Voygr became the first and only design so far to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",

Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

            "The British government confirmed the Sizewell C nuclear power station will go ahead, backing the scheme with a £700m (€809m) stake and saying it wants to see more nuclear projects being prepared. Funding for the project was signed off by Boris Johnson at the start of September in one of his last acts as prime minister and confirmed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement. The twin EPR station is a joint endeavour with French state energy giant EDF and is expected to take a decade to build at the cost of between £20-£30bn. Large-scale reactors are under construction or consideration around the world. Test production has begun at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Flamanville-3 in France is close to completion, while fuel is being loaded at Vogtle in the US. Construction continued at Akkuyu, Turkey’s first nuclear station, with a second under consideration. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, around 30 countries are considering or embarking on the construction of new reactors. They include established nuclear nations such as the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, China and India, and newcomers such as Poland, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The International Energy Agency says a new wave of construction will be key to achieving net zero and ensuring energy security.  ",

Three Westinghouse-made AP1000 pressurised water reactor units will be deployed at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the northern province of Pomerania. The first unit is scheduled to be online in 2033 as set in Warsaw’s 2020 nuclear energy programme while the start of construction is earmarked for 2026. Under a 2020 nuclear programme, Poland has ambitious plans to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear with commercial operation of a first nuclear unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033, with the rest to follow throughout the 2030s and into the early 2040s. Warsaw Also said it remains “open” to cooperation with the European and global nuclear industries for the deployment of a second nuclear power plant in the country despite selecting Westinghouse for the construction of a first nuclear power station. Polish energy companies ZE PAK and PGE signed a letter of intent with South Korea’s KHNP for the proposed construction of a third nuclear power station at the Patnow site in central Poland – a project described as one to be developed by “private business” and not run by the government.",

            "Repowering existing coal plant infrastructure – including with small modular reactors – is the largest single carbon abatement opportunity on the planet and could greatly accelerate the clean energy transition while using existing infrastructure and maintaining vital jobs and a major topic to watch in 2023 and beyond. A report by TerraPraxis said replacing coal-fired boilers at existing coal plants with carbon-free SMRs, also known as advanced heat sources, would transform coal-fired power plants from polluting liabilities facing an uncertain future, into a central component of a clean energy system transition – an important part of the massive and pressing infrastructure buildout needed to address climate change. The US Department of Energy said This “coal-to-nuclear” transition could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping the US reach its net-zero emissions goals by 2050. TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, plans to deploy its Natrium reactor technology at a coal site in the US state of Wyoming. In Poland Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began investigating the site of coal plant in southern Poland for the construction of APR1400 nuclear power plants.

Oil-rich Saudi Arabia began the process of choosing a vendor\r\nfor the construction of its first commercial nuclear power station with bids likely to come from South Korea, France, China and Russia. Riyadh wants to build two 1,400 MW nuclear power plants, a down-sized effort from an ambitious goal set in 2014 to build 16 units of about 1,000 MW each. Saudi Arabia said earlier this year it is aiming to take advantage of its significant uranium resources to develop a commercial nuclear power programme.

            "Mr Gajda said a decision on reactor technology is needed to proceed to the next stages of the project – to prepare final project and to prepare the safety report and all the other documents necessary to obtain the permit from the Polish Atomic Energy Agency [PAA]”.",
            "He said the financial element of the project will be a challenge. ",
            "“There are expectations from all potential partners that the offers will include an option of financing such as taking up shares or granting loans,” Mr Gajda said.",
            "The Polish government is negotiating with potential partners about financing the project. Piotr Naimski, secretary of state and plenipotentiary of the Polish government for strategic energy infrastructure,  said recently: “We are talking about large amounts of money, but to be managed by the Polish state.”",
            "Poland wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity based on proven, large-scale, pressurised water reactor technology. Commercial operation of a first unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033.",
            "Offers have been submitted by France’s state-owned EDF and South Korea’s Korea Hydro Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of state-owned Korea Electric Power Corporation. A bid from US company Westinghouse is expected by the end of September. ",
            "Mr Gajda, who also serves as secretary-general of the Polish Nuclear Society and in the board of directors of European Nuclear Society, said three factors could be decisive when Poland makes a decision: who will offer the better funding package and model; the level of participation of Polish industry so that as much investment as possible stays in Poland; and cooperation between suppliers. ",
            "“Regardless of which technology we choose, all three suppliers will participate in this project,” he said. “For example, consider the [Barakah nuclear power station] project in the United Arab Emirates, which was implemented by South Korea. Westinghouse has been involved there”. ",
            "Westinghouse provided technical assistance and licensing work for the Barakah project and has signed support agreements with Barakah operator Nawah Energy. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) agreed recently with Westinghouse to explore ways to cooperate on international nuclear power generation markets, with South Korea saying it plans to export 10 nuclear power plants by 2030.",
            "Mr Gajda said nuclear projects carry “geopolitical weight” and he believes that for this reason Poland does not want China and Russia involved in the project, despite fact that that they are very active in new-build projects around the world, especially in emerging markets like the Middle East or Africa. He said China and Russia offer good financing conditions, but in exchange for influence or access to raw materials and other elements. “It is a new variation of colonialism in a sense,” he said, adding “it is important to be associated with a partner that is politically credible”.",
            "Another challenge Poland faces is the need to build up human resources for the licensing of planned reactors. Mr Gajda said Warsaw has about two years to build up staff, but the Polish Atomic Energy Agency has “already taken steps to strengthen personnel”. This year it increased its budget for staff with reactor assessment tasks.",
            "Poland’s bullishness on nuclear is also seen in the fact that a number of large Polish enterprises have signed agreements on small modular reactors, which they see as to help decarbonise the energy sector. Synthos Green Energy, PKN Orlen and KGHM have all announced plans to deploy SMRs, with the first unjit scheduled to be built in 2029. ",
            "Mr Gajda said: “I believe in SMR technology, but not in the dates given by the companies.” ",
            "He said the most advanced technology is US-based NuScale’s with the Carbon Free Power Project in Idaho. “They’ve already got a site report filed and they’re supposed to apply for a construction licence in early 2024” he said. “So, they are many steps ahead of the Polish projects. The CFPP project is scheduled be operational in 2030.”",
            "Mr Gajda said estimated capital expenditure for the first NuScale BWRX-300 SMR in Poland of €1.1bn is “optimistic”. He said “nobody knows how much SMRs – or large-scale nuclear plants – will cost, but this uncertainty is much greater in projects that haven’t built a prototype yet”.  ",
            "“We see what is happening on international markets in terms of the prices of materials and these are elements that will affect projects.”",
            "Component manufacturers point to rising prices for electricity and materials such as steel. In addition, the recovery of global economies from the Covid-19 pandemic means there is a shortage of raw materials, a situation that has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. ",

            "Converting 5,000 – 7,000 coal plant units globally between 2030 and 2050 (250 – 350 per year) will require a “redesigned delivery model” that has to de-risk the construction process, the riskiest part of a project.",
            "This means providing coal plant owners and investors with high-certainty schedules and budgets. Purpose-built automated tools can achieve rapid, repeatable, and confident project and planning assessments. ",
            "TerraPraxis has assembled a consortium of partners including Bryden Wood, Microsoft, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and University at Buffalo, along with a consortium of global utilities, to launch the ‘Repowering Coal’ initiative. The aim is to provide standardised, pre-licensed designs supported by automated project development and design tools to enable customers to be ready to start construction on their SMR projects in the late 2020s.",
            "Bryden Wood, a UK-based design and engineering firm, has created a new design and construction solution that the group says would make such a programme possible at scale and speed, in part by deploying a new digital platform.",
            "“The result of this repowering will be carbon-free power plants that are cheaper to operate than before, and to ensure continuity for communities reliant on these plants for energy, jobs, and continued economic development,” Eric Ingersoll, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis said.",
            "Kirsty Gogan, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis, said that by sustaining permanent high-quality jobs for communities, repowered coal plants reduce the negative impacts on communities to public and political support for a just transition. ",
            "“The challenge is not only to build enough clean electricity generation to power the world, but to do so quickly while building the infrastructure required to decarbonise end-use sectors such as heat, industry, and transport,” she said at the Nuclear Innovation Conference in Amsterdam.",
            "Grogan said the plan is to replace the existing coal plant boiler with a standardised advanced heat source (AHS) that fits into a standardised facility. A new heat transfer and storage system will run between the existing coal plant and the AHS, which is itself in two parts: the reactor within a modular, component-based enclosure, and another enclosure with support systems. A modular heat transfer system and associated energy storage will allow the plant to efficiently match reactor output with generation demand.”",
            "There will be regulatory challenges to repurposing coal plants. They vary widely and developing a new SMR design for each plant would be complex, costly, and slow. Rather than thousands of individual projects, TerraPraxis’ aim is to develop a unified approach where the design is simplified and standardised to make this plan a reality as quickly as possible.",
            "Gogan said: “Our building system is designed to reduce regulatory scope by firstly separating the power island from the heat island via thermal energy storage. ",
            "“This means that no accident propagation is possible from the power island to the heat island, and that the power island has no nuclear safety requirements. ",
            "Secondly, safety by design characteristics of the advanced heat sources means that safety is achieved with no active safety systems. This reduces complexity and means that all safety-related systems can be combined in one reactor building.”",
            "The relatively small reactor building, assembled from pre-fabricated components, therefore becomes the only safety-related building. “As part of their initial license review, the regulator will have already reviewed this exact configuration and its associated building designs,” Gogan said.",
            "According to TerraPraxis, the world has more than 2 TW of coal-fired electric power plants, adding roughly 12 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions per year. These annual emissions amount to almost one-third of global total forecast net annual emissions of 38.8 Gt/year.",
            "Some policymakers, climate modelers and activists assume that countries will simply shut down their coal plants to reduce carbon emissions. However, because more than half of coal plants worldwide are less than 14 years old, it is unrealistic to expect such young assets to simply retire, especially considering growing energy demand and supply shortages.",
            "“Even in countries with relatively old coal plants, such as the US, Canada and Europe, closing coal plants is difficult and controversial because the loss of jobs and revenues can be devastating for communities, and utilities continue to value the reliable electricity generated,” TerraPraxis says.",
            "In Wyoming, the largest state producer of coal in the US, roughly 80% of electricity production comes from coal-fired power plants that have been steadily declining in terms of their output, but also closing down, since the mid-2000.",

            "The two companies signed an agreement in 2022, and with conceptual engineering and regulatory studies completed the next steps include \"completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project in Canada by 2030\".",
            "Jon Ball, eVinci Technologies President for Westinghouse, said: \"From the start, our eVinci technology was designed to be transportable, that was a key design principle. So, we designed it to be small, we made it plug-and-play, and we made it deliverable to anywhere. The TNPP from Prodigy brings an additional value to the inherent transportability of the technology.\"",
            "Mathias Trojer, president and CEO of Prodigy Clean Energy, said: \"The eVinci microreactor’s compact design and simplified operating requirements make it optimal for integration into a Prodigy TNPP. Our technology will enable fleet deployment of the eVinci, accelerating the timeline to deliver clean, reliable and affordable power at commercial scale to remote regions.\"",
            "As well as a microreactor power station, Prodigy is also developing a larger version, a small modular reactor (SMR) power plant, deployable at the shoreline \"ideal for coal replacement and grid-scale power generation\". In October 2022, it unveiled a conceptual design for an SMR Marine Power Station, developed with NuScale, which could house between one and twelve NuScale Power Modules.",
            "Prodigy says that with both TNPPs it packages the microreactors or SMR into the prefabricated and relocatable power plant structures and transports them to their site, and removes them at the end of life after 60 years, so \"simplify the full facility lifecycle, dramatically reducing new build costs and complexity\".",

            "Waste management issues need to have a significantly greater prominence in the process of developing and deploying small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor designs, according to the UK's Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM).",
            "The six contenders in the UK SMR contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "\"There is considerable impetus for the development of small modular reactor (SMR) and advanced modular reactor (AMR) designs and their commercial deployment, both for energy security and for environmental reasons, particularly given the historic difficulties of deploying reactors at gigawatt scale,\" CoRWM notes in a new",
            "However, it says the issue of managing the used fuel and radioactive waste from these new reactors \"appears, with some exceptions ... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed up to now\". It adds that the issue \"must be considered when selecting technologies for investment, further development, construction and operation\".",
            "The paper says: \"This must involve addressing the uncertainties about such management at an early stage, to avoid costly mistakes which have been made in the past, by designing reactors without sufficient consideration of how spent fuel and wastes would be managed, and also to provide financial certainty for investors regarding lifetime costs of operation and decommissioning.\"",
            "CoRWM says it is essential to know: the nature and composition of the waste and, in particular, of the used fuel; its likely heat generation and activity levels; how it could feasibly be packaged and its volume; and when it is likely to arise.",
            "\"So far there is little published material from the promoters and developers of new reactor types to demonstrate that they are devoting the necessary level of attention to the waste prospectively arising from SMR/AMRs,\" it notes.",
            "The position paper provides recommendations to the UK government, Great British Nuclear (GBN), and Nuclear Waste Services and regulators to consider as SMR and AMR deployment is progressed.",
            "\"There are many questions to be answered concerning the radioactive waste and spent fuel management aspects of the design and operation of SMRs and AMRs,\" CoRWM says. \"This paper begins the process of raising them, with the caveat that our knowledge of the reactor designs and their fuel requirements is relatively immature compared with large GW reactors.\"",
            "CoRWM says there are various mechanisms by which these questions could be addressed in the process of obtaining approval for the new reactors. These are principally: the process of justification, which will be mandatory for all new reactor types; Generic Design Assessment which is optional and non-statutory; nuclear site licensing; and environmental permitting.",
            "\"The last two stages of control may in some cases come too late in the process to allow for effective optimisation of designs and the selection of materials that reduce waste,\" CoRWM says. \"It remains to be seen how effective these mechanisms will be and whether they will occur sufficiently early in the decision-making process to ensure that radioactive waste management is fully and responsibly addressed.\"",
            "CoRWM was established in 2003 as a non-statutory advisory committee and is classed as a non-departmental public body. Its purpose is to provide independent advice to the UK government, and the devolved administrations based on scrutiny of the available evidence on the long-term management of radioactive waste, arising from civil and, where relevant, defence nuclear programmes, including storage and disposal.",
            "The UK government has plans to expand nuclear energy capacity to 24 GW by 2050, with a fleet of SMRs a key part of that strategy. Last year, the government and the new GBN arms-length body set up to help deliver that extra capacity began the selection process for which SMR technology to use. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of the process.",

            "Hundreds of coal power plant sites across the USA could be converted to nuclear plant sites, providing huge decarbonisation gains as well as bringing tangible economic, employment and environmental benefits to the communities where those plants are located, a new US Department of Energy (DOE) study has found.",
            "Hundreds of US coal power plant sites could be converted to nuclear power plants (Image: DOE)",
            "A coal-to-nuclear (C2N) transition - siting a nuclear reactor at the site of a recently retired coal power plant - could help increase US nuclear capacity to more than 350 GWe,",
            "Investigating Benefits and Challenges of Converting Retiring Coal Plants into Nuclear Plants",
            "found. The USA's current nuclear fleet has a combined capacity of 95 GWe.",
            "The report is underpinned by a study carried out by the Argonne, Idaho and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, sponsored by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy. It is guided by three overarching questions: where in the USA are retired coal facilities located and what factors make a site feasible for transition; what factors of technology, cost, and project timeline drive investor economics over such a decision; and how will C2N impact local communities?",
            "The team screened recently retired and active coal plant sites to identify 157 retired and 237 operating coal plants sites as potential candidates for a C2N transition, which it further evaluated on parameters including population density, distance from seismic fault lines, flooding potential, and nearby wetlands, to determine if they could safely host a nuclear power plant. It found that 80% of the potential sites are suitable for hosting advanced nuclear power plants of varying size and type, depending on the size of the site being converted.",
            "The team then evaluated a case study of detailed impacts and potential outcomes from a C2N transition at a hypothetical site, considering various nuclear technology types for a range of scenarios including large light-water reactors, small modular reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors and very high temperature reactors.",
            "At the regional level, replacing a large coal plant site with a nuclear power plant of equivalent size could provide some 650 jobs and USD275 million of economic activity, the report found. These jobs are spread across the plant, the supply chain supporting the plant, and the community surrounding the plant and most typically come with wages that are about 25% higher than any other energy technology. Nuclear power plant projects could also benefit from preserving the existing experienced workforce in communities around retiring coal plant sites, which already possess the necessary skills and knowledge that could be tranistioned to work at a nuclear power plant.",
            "Reusing existing coal infrastructure for new advanced nuclear reactors can lead to construction cost savings of 15-35%, the report found. Using existing land, grid connections, office buildings, electrical equipment such as transmission connections and switchyards, and civil infrastructure could also save millions of dollars upfront.",
            "Economic potential exists for owners of coal power plants - and the communities where they are located - from a C2N transition, the report concludes, with a potential further advantage for interested coal communities to be \"first movers\" in what the authors say could be a series of many C2N transitions across the USA. Although the study's findings inform only at a general level, the results could be used to set up more detailed, in-depth analyses to allow more accurate evaluations specific to a particular coal plant or nuclear technology design.",
            "The report was subjected to independent peer reviews by experts in systems engineering and regional economic modelling to evaluate analysis and assumptions.",
            "The possibility of replacing coal power plants with nuclear capacity is being actively explored in the USA and elsewhere. TerraPower in 2021 announced plans to build a demonstration unit of its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor at a retired coal plant site in Wyoming; earlier this year, the the Maryland Energy Administration announced its support for work to evaluate the possibility of repurposing a coal-fired electric generating facility with X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor; and Holtec International recently said it is considering coal plant sites as possible locations for its SMR-160 with plans to bring the first unit online as early as 2029. In Poland, NuScale is exploring with energy company Unimot and copper and silver producer KGHM possibilities for its reactors to replace coal-fired power plants.",

            "A rendering of a BWRX-300 plant (Image: GEH)",
            "In September 2022, Fermi Energia said it would accept tenders from three SMR developers: GE Hitachi, NuScale and Rolls-Royce. Bids with the comprehensive technical documentation needed to estimate the construction cost were expected by December. The company said in the selection of technology, the criteria were technological maturity, the establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "Fermi Energia has now announced the selection of GEH as the winning bidder, and said it will now sign a project development and preliminary works contract.",
            "GEH's BWRX-300 design is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor. It is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission pre-licensing Vendor Design Review and a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission pre-application design review.",
            "\"As the initial construction will start in Canada, Fermi Energia saw the reactor as the most suitable for construction in Estonia out of the three offers received,\" it said. \"Based on the design and construction experience of the Darlington nuclear power plant near Toronto, Ontario, the planning, design and construction of the Estonian nuclear power plant can also be gradually started.\"",
            "\"The BWRX-300 is in principle a boiling water reactor, which is used and well known by many European countries, including Finland and Sweden,\" noted Fermi Energia CEO Kalev Kallemets. \"However, the specific reactor model is much smaller than the ones used in the nuclear plants of our northern neighbours, which allows greater safety, lower cost, and shorter build time. At the same time, it is possible to rely on the experience of neighbours and offer the consumer clean electricity at an affordable and stable price.\"",
            "GEH and Fermi Energia have worked together since 2019 when an agreement was reached to collaborate on potential deployment applications for the BWRX-300. The collaboration advanced in 2021 when the two parties entered into a teaming agreement to work together in key areas that included licensing support and supply chain development.",
            "\"We are honoured that our small modular reactor technology has been selected by Fermi Energia to help Estonia fulfill its energy security and climate goals,\" said GEH President and CEO Jay Wileman. \"By leveraging a unique combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components and a design based on an already licensed reactor, the BWRX-300 offers cost-competitive zero-emission generation in a meaningful timeframe.\"",
            "GEH noted the technology selection by Fermi Energia is the latest development involving the BWRX-300. Last month, it was announced that GEH, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), SNC-Lavalin and Aecon have signed a contract for the deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at OPG's Darlington site. In August last year, Tennessee Valley Authority began planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site in Tennessee. Canada's SaskPower announced in June 2022 that it selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s.",
            "In Poland, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners started the pre-licensing process by submitting an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE plans to deploy a fleet of BWRX-300s with the potential for deployment of the first of those units by the end of this decade.",
            "To support the global deployment of the BWRX-300, GEH has a memorandum of understanding or other agreement in place with companies in Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, the UK, the USA and Sweden, among others. GEH has also begun the design certification process for the BWRX-300 in the UK.",
            "\"The choice of BWRX-300 by Polish, Swedish and other European companies gives assurance that the competence and supply chain of the selected technology will be sufficient in Europe,\" Kallemets said.",
            "Fermi Energia noted that, in order to construct a nuclear power plant in Estonia, a decision is needed from the parliament - the Riigikogu - to approve the use of nuclear energy in the country. Also, a special national plan to find a suitable location for the plant must be undertaken, as well as the development of nuclear energy legislation.",
            "\"We have analysed all the work ahead and consider it realistic to produce reliable, clean and affordable nuclear energy in Estonia by Christmas 2031, which should also be in the interest of society and the country's climate goals,\" Kallemets said. \"Understandably, this goal requires a serious effort from both the state and Fermi Energia.\"",
            "Fermi Energia was founded by Estonian energy and nuclear energy professionals to develop deployment of SMRs in Estonia. In July 2019, the company launched a feasibility study on the suitability of SMRs for Estonia's electricity supply and climate goals beyond 2030, following a financing round from investors and shareholders. It selected four SMR designs to be included in the feasibility study: Moltex Energy SSR-W300, Terrestrial Energy IMSR-400, GE Hitachi BWRX-300 and NuScale SMR.",

            "The key quotes from the Great British Nuclear (GBN) chairman's",
            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

        "title": "SNP ministers say government’s poor infrastructure procurement has led to £100bn overspend",
        "text": [
            "Ministers from the Scottish National Party (SNP) have slammed the UK government’s infrastructure procurement, saying there is “£100bn overspend in infrastructure projects without even digging too deeply”.",
            "SNP MP for Kilmarnock and Loudon Alan Brown brought the matter of infrastructure procurement to a House of Commons chamber adjournment debate on 19 February. Serious doubts about the government’s management of High Speed 2 (HS2) and its commitment to nuclear power formed the core of his argument.",
            "Brown started the debate by outlining “a few of the projects that UK governments have had responsibility for and failed to deliver properly, and illustrate just how much that has cost the taxpayer”. He then reeled off “£45bn on the HS2 phase 1 overspend, the £30bn overspend on Hinkley Point C, the £10bn overspend in the Shared Services network replacement, a very modest £3bn overspend in Crossrail, and a couple of billion extra spent on the Great Western electrification project”.",
            "“Therefore, very quickly, we have a £90bn overspend before we even get to the black hole that is Ministry of Defence procurement,” he added.",
            "After dissecting the issues that have arisen through the government’s procurement and management of infrastructure delivery, Brown said that the government must come up with an overarching strategy that links needs to outcomes and identifies budgets, providing contractors with a clear pipeline of work that will allow them to “gear up and plan ahead accordingly”.",
            "Brown said: “All these projects I have spoken about show that risk needs to be correctly allocated. The lessons learned means that sufficient up-front design work needs to be undertaken. We need early contractor involvement and a clear pipeline of projects. These are all matters that the construction industry has actually been calling for for years. We also need politicians to take responsibility, where required, and for politicians to understand that undue interference and the chopping and changing of projects mean an increase in costs and programme delays.",
            "“Somehow in today’s political world, we do need to have cross-party working as much as possible. One thing is for sure: we cannot continue to have flagship projects that are handled as badly as HS2, Hinkley and the rest. It is quite clear that some politicians down here [in Westminster] really do need to look in before they look out when it comes to infrastructure delivery.”",
            "The government’s response came from Cabinet Office parliamentary undersecretary Alex Burghart, who proclaimed the value of the recently published National Infrastructure and Construction Pipeline. He said this reflects the government’s “commitment to economic growth and productivity” and “is going to provide great certainty to the industry”.",
            "Burghart added that the new Procurement Act 2023 “will create a simpler and more transparent system that delivers better value for money and reduces costs for business and the public sectors, and learns the lessons of recent years”. Further, he promoted the Construction Playbook for setting out “how contracting authorities can now ensure that this ambitious programme of public investment is delivered in a way that maximises value for money”.",
            "Burghart continued: “One in every £3 of public money—some £300bn a year—is spent on public procurement. By improving the way public procurement is regulated, the government will save the taxpayer money and drive benefits across every region of our country.",
            "“Following the UK’s exit from the EU, we have seized the opportunity to develop and implement a new procurement regime in a way that simply was not possible while we were members of the EU. The Act helps deliver the prime minister’s promise to grow the economy by creating a simpler and more transparent system that will deliver better value for money and reduce costs to businesses and the public sector. Crucially, it will provide new opportunities to small and medium-sized enterprises to get a bigger share of that £300bn a year prize, a great achievement.”",
            "Brown and fellow SNP ministers Dave Doogan and Gavin Newlands, who were also in attendance, remained unconvinced by these claims.",
            "Issues with HS2 procurement",
            "Much of Brown’s speech focused on HS2. He commented on how the “the original business case and proposals were for it to extend to Scotland to help with a modal shift away from flying”. He added that it was also to improve business productivity by allowing a quicker connection between Scotland and London.",
            "He went on to say that the argument for HS2 changed to be about freeing up capacity on existing lines, particularly the West Coast Main Line. While Brown said that this was fine in principle and good for decarbonisation but added: “what the different arguments and analysis mean is that there was never an established rationale for the key outcomes for HS2”.",
            "“That has made it easier, as part of the inherent north-south bias of a London government, to make phase 1 of the project the London to Birmingham link, and to make that the most important aspect,” he added.",
            "Doogan, who is SNP MP for Angus, interjected to say that, despite HS2 being promoted as a project that would connect the length of Great Britain, “we knew we were getting nothing out of it in Scotland”. He added that his constituents are footing £92M of the HS2 bill, when it would be better spent on a link to Laurencekirk, fixing erosion on the Montrose Links or better flood defences in Brechin.",
            "Brown then returned to his speech and tore into the decision by the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd to procure “the quickest high-speed trains” which, once they reach the standard railway north of Birmingham, will actually run slower than existing Avanti West Coast services.",
            "“Not only will we not get high-speed rail to Scotland, we will get a poorer service from the new high-speed rail once it is running on the West Coast Main Line,” he said. “How can that be a logical proposal for the most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken by a UK government?”",
            "Brown then outlined the step-by-step dismantling of the HS2 network: the successive removals of the eastern leg to Leeds, the Golborne link to connect it to the WCML, the western leg to Manchester and the southern terminus at Euston.",
            "“Clearly, there is no overall strategic thinking other than a continual form of panicked cost control,” he said. “Unfortunately, HS2 is a monument to a poorly developed concept of not knowing what the key strategic objectives would be, unrealistic budgets, politicians meddling in route alignment and increasing the amount of tunnelling, politician panic as costs increase, continual stop-start reviews all costing money, over-specification, unrealistic risk allocation, and clearly not enough up-front design and site investigation work or proper planning with regard to project delivery and discussions with contractors.”",
            "Hinkley Point C and nuclear woes",
            "Brown then moved on to “another major infrastructure project that is very similar in its overspend, delays and costs spiralling out of control: Hinkley Point C nuclear power station”.",
            "He mentioned the January update from EDF Energy in which it revealed that the cost estimate has hit £46bn in today’s prices, adding “by last week, it had already increased to £48bn”.",
            "“That is a mere £30bn overspend on what was already the world’s most expensive power station,” he continued. “Instead of generating power in 2025, it will now be as late as 2031. As costs have continued to spiral, the government’s attitude is, ‘It’s okay, the risk lies entirely with EDF,’ which is completely head-in-the-sand stuff.”",
            "Brown mentioned that EDF’s partner China General Nuclear has refused to put any more capital into the project and therefore “clearly EDF is having to fund a lot more borrowing”. He said it “beggars belief” that the government is not engaging EDF on this issue, especially as the energy company’s chief executive Luc Rémont said last week that he is confident that there will be a “a pathway with British authorities on Hinkley Point C and Sizewell”.",
            "“In other words, there will be another taxpayer bailout,” Brown said.",
            "Brown then lambasted the government for “diving head first” into the regulated asset base (RAB) model for funding the construction of the next planned large-scale nuclear power station, Sizewell C.",
            "The RAB model sees private investors pay a large upfront contribution that is recouped through a surcharge on taxes, with the amount being set by an independent regulator, in this case Ofgem.",
            "Brown cited the case of a nuclear power station in South Carolina which was paid for through RAB, but was abandoned midway – yet billpayers are still paying an increased rate to make up for the private investment that was sunk into it.",
            "“How will the UK Government make sure that this does not happen at Sizewell?”, he questioned.",
            "The Citizens Advice Bureau has also expressed concerns about the RAB model for funding Sizewell C, saying that it will likely “offer consumers poor value for money even if it is cheaply financed”.",
            "Doogan then interjected to say that HM Treasury seems to have no concern for nuclear overspends.",
            "“When it comes to nuclear, regardless of whether it is civil or military, there is no shortage of UK government funding,” Doogan said. “Yet all across GB there are plans for massive pylon lines going through communities. The pylon lines could be offshored but have to be done at the lowest possible cost, which means overhead lines.",
            "“There is no parity between nuclear and anything else. Everything else is bargain-basement, Treasury Green Book ‘let’s screw the contractor down to the very lowest price’, except for nuclear.”",
            "Brown agreed and added that the government is “kidding itself” about nuclear and is still claiming that Sizewell C will cost £20bn.",
            "“We already know that Hinkley, which is the model for Sizewell C, is costing nearly £50bn, so why pretend that it will cost only £20bn?” he said. “They are setting their stall out wrongly and have a blinkered approach that suggests we somehow need nuclear, when clearly we do not actually need it.",
            "“What they should be investing in is renewable energy, storage systems and [...] much better grid infrastructure as well.”",
            "Brown then turned his attention to small modular reactors (SMRs), the small-scale nuclear plants that government is aiming to deploy in numbers to help decarbonise the electricity system.",
            "He said that this needs to be reconsidered, echoing the doubts recently cast by the Environmental Audit Committee about the potential for SMRs to aid in the decarbonisation of the grid.",
            "“First, they are not small, and no proven design is operational anywhere in the world, but it seems that the British exceptionalism that the government believes in means that Britain will somehow lead the way in all sorts of nuclear power generation,” he said.",
            "He cited NuScale, the American power corporation that was to be the first to deploy SMR technology, which has recently abandoned its maiden Utah power station after costs ballooned to over £7bn.",
            "“The government, true to form, believes that it will be able to deliver SMRs for about £2bn a go,” Brown said. “That defies all logic and inevitably means yet more future infrastructure delays and overspend.”",
            "Brown then contrasted the Westminster government’s infrastructure delivery struggles with some success stories in Scotland.",
            "“It is worth highlighting that the Scottish Government have delivered the longest stretch of new railway since Victorian times with the reopening of the Borders railway in 2015,” he said. “That is a real success story—one that the Tories said would never happen. Is it ever praised or used by the Tories as a good example? No. Instead, their immediate messaging is about the need to extend the railway further, an aspiration that the Scottish Government shares.",
            "“It seems to me that, at some point, politicians must be gracious about successful projects, and take learning from them for other projects.”",
            "Brown also commented on the successful delivery of rail electrification north of the border.",
            "“Scotland has always had a clear and steady programme, unlike the continual chopping and changing of programmes in England,” he said. “It generates contractor expertise and a steady supply chain, and contractors are confident that there will be a future pipeline of work. The cost of delivering electrification in Scotland is £2M per km, compared with £3M per km in England, so the UK government’s procurement rate is 50% higher than that of the Scottish Government.”",
            "Brown then said that the Scottish Government would be better off if it were independent and able to control its own infrastructure procurement and delivery.",
            "“A proper budget-setting process should mean looking at needs, and then deciding what funding is required to suit those needs and what the aspirations are,” he said. “Instead, at every Budget, we are supposed to doff our cap and be grateful that increased spend in England gives some crumbs to Scotland. That is not proper planning.",
            "“Again, an independent country that had proper borrowing powers would be able to plan strategically for the future, instead of this haphazard measure that is reliant on the Barnett formula.”",
            "He continued: “It goes back to the fact that an independent country making its own decisions would plan strategically and be able to borrow money accordingly. Quite often, borrowing for infrastructure leads to the kind of circular reinvestment in job creation that is a win-win.",
            "“If we look at roads, we see that it was the SNP that finally delivered a continuous motorway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The M74 and the M80 have been completed, as has the Queensferry crossing.",
            "“Yes, if we listen to the headlines, the A9 has clearly been delayed: a much more realistic programme for the A9 should have been developed before now, and Transport Scotland should also have heeded industry concerns about its bespoke contract models making it difficult for contractors to bid.",
            "“However, the reality is that the SNP Government has delivered on a limited budget, and while the Tories demand more and more, they are also content with the capital allocation being cut over the next two years.”"

            "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero requested that the GDA takes place following the department’s readiness review of GE Hitachi’s application which concluded that the design is ready to enter the GDA process which can take approximately four years.",
            "The government said that the GDA will “look to actively explore opportunities to maximise the value of international regulatory collaboration and identify efficiencies in processes.”",

            "Nuclear energy has been assigned a major role in the UK’s energy strategy. But the strategy will fail unless the government supports and enables the delivery of small nuclear reactors alongside faster construction of large reactors.",
            "Mark Liddiard is a senior consultant in Mott MacDonald’s nuclear business",
            "In April 2022 the UK government set out its ambition to quadruple UK nuclear power generating capacity to 24GW by 2050. That will meet approximately a quarter of electricity demand if it remains the same as today. It is part of a strategy to improve energy security and fulfil the legally binding commitment to reduce national emissions to net-zero.",
            "Then former prime minister Boris Johnson was reportedly frustrated by his chancellor Rishi Sunak’s determination to scrutinise the cost of new nuclear, which delayed the strategy’s publication. But scrutiny complete and the 24GW nuclear goal announced, in August Sunak declared himself a strong supporter of nuclear.",
            "Now Sunak has the top job, and he needs to convert verbal support into practical action. Only one of the UK’s existing nuclear reactors, Sizewell B, is scheduled to continue operating after 2028 – although the current energy crunch could lead to short life extensions for the Hartlepool and Heysham 1 reactors.",
            "By 2050, all the country’s nuclear electricity must be from new reactors. Building 24GW that fast will require an exceptional effort, embracing all available options.",
            "And the challenge may be far greater: as part of our study, The path to zero carbon heat, for the Net Zero Infrastructure Industry Coalition in 2018, we estimated that full electrification of the UK economy will require 400GW total electricity generation capacity.",
            "Jeremy Reed is the global nuclear practice lead at Mott MacDonald",
            "Hinkley Point C, currently under construction on the north Somerset coast, will provide 3.2GW of electricity from two pressurised water reactor (PWR) units. After a decade in planning, the project was approved for construction in 2016 and is now scheduled to enter operation in June 2027. An 8,000-strong workforce is being employed to build it, and the final construction bill is expected to be £27bn.",
            "The government has identified eight sites across the UK suitable for new reactors – all existing nuclear sites – but statutory consultations and approvals will be required. That phase of the project cycle should be shorter than for Hinkley Point C but will still take years.",
            "And building large-scale new nuclear power stations is slow, resource intensive and expensive. Hinkley Point C’s owner/operator will be French energy giant EDF. It anticipates that the Hinkley supply chain and workforce will transition to the next new build project, the 3.2GW Sizewell C in Suffolk, which will be to the same PWR design. EDF reckons that maintaining momentum, applying lessons learned and retaining skills will enable Sizewell C to be built 20% more efficiently.",
            "Yet, at that speed and if building new reactors sequentially, the UK can complete only three or at most four new power stations by 2050, falling far short of the targeted 24GW.",
            "An attraction of new nuclear projects is the opportunity to create new jobs and upskill people. However, the need for speed requires a bigger workforce, with perhaps three times the current number of skilled workers able to work on new nuclear projects. If the UK economy cools and workers are laid off in other industries, recruiting the required numbers may be possible. But if the employment market as a whole remains hot, the construction industry will face the same challenge it has done for decades already: attracting enough talent to deliver the pipeline of infrastructure projects. Competition for people could be a significant barrier to progress.",
            "The very scale of large nuclear projects is also problematic, causing severe distortions in local economies: housing, feeding, transporting and entertaining thousands of workers and supplying vast quantities of construction materials impacts communities both during and after construction. Impacts can be both good and bad – and must be carefully managed.",
            "Small modular reactor (SMR) technology should have an important role to play in reaching the 24GW goal. SMRs typically have an output of less than 300MWe, although Rolls-Royce is developing a 470MWe unit. Whereas the reactor designs of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C must be built in situ, the companies developing SMR designs say they will be factory built and delivered to site as ‘plug-in’ modules. With less construction, the time from project start to operation will be much shorter. Rolls-Royce says that its first 470MWe plant could be built for £2.5bn, falling to £1.8bn as its ‘production line’ gets up to speed. Build time will be between three and five years.",
            "Rapid construction and a cost comparable to offshore wind per MWe of electricity generated are matched by other attractions. Many of the jobs created will be factory-based and able to tap existing manufacturing skills as the economy transitions from ‘old’ industrial technologies to new ones.",
            "SMRs can be installed alongside existing operational and decommissioned nuclear and coal fired power plants, dispatching electricity using transmission infrastructure already in place. With regulatory approval and community consent, SMRs could be installed locally to meet industrial or consumer demand without the need for long-distance transmission and associated energy losses. And SMR designs offer faster output regulation than large reactors, making them attractive for balancing variations in wind and solar power production, as well as a source of base load.",
            "However, to date, not one SMR has been completed anywhere in the world, so their promise is theoretical, not proven. In early November Rolls-Royce identified four priority sites in the UK, plus another four that are suitable, but no sites have yet been confirmed by government.",
            "American regulators approved a SMR design by NuScale in 2020 and Rolls-Royce’s design is inching through the process of safety verification. But globally, approving new SMR technology is painstaking and slow. It is expected that technology vendors will collaborate and produce merged designs to speed deployment. International collaboration between nuclear regulators could further accelerate the pace: The vision for SMR technology vendors is to be able to supply the same plant globally with multinational approval.",
            "At present the levelised cost of electricity (lifetime total cost divided by lifetime total production) for Hinkley Point C is forecast to be £106; £85 for Sizewell C; £65 for Rolls-Royce’s first SMR; and £53 for NuScale’s American SMR. The importance of decarbonising the energy system and building energy security mean that decisions about new nuclear energy can’t be made purely on cost: the UK requires large reactors and SMRs. If a pipeline of projects and a competitive supply chain can be created, the unit cost for both technologies should fall.",
            "But only when the first PWR and SMR plants have been delivered will the true capital and operational costs be known.",
            "The government can bring that point closer by:",
            "supporting the implementation of funding mechanisms to attract private capital – in July the European Union accepted nuclear as a sustainable technology, making it eligible for green finance",
            "streamlining consents, in particular at the front-end of the development consent order process – SMRs will not be economic if subject to the same consenting costs as large reactors",

        "text": [
            "A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has assessed the feasibility of deploying small modular nuclear reactors to meet increasing energy demands around the world. The report, “Small Modular Reactors: Still Too Expensive, Too Slow, and Too Risky” asks if continuing to pursue small NPPs is worthwhile in terms of meeting increasing global energy demands. demand for more energy around the globe.",
            "The 23-page report notes: “The rhetoric from small modular reactor (SMR) advocates is loud and persistent: This time will be different because the cost overruns and schedule delays that have plagued large reactor construction projects will not be repeated with the new designs,” says the report. “But the few SMRs that have been built (or have been started) paint a different picture – one that looks startlingly similar to the past. Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "On costs, the report looks at three operating SMRs worldwide—two in Russia [possibly just one – the Akademik Lomonosov, which has two reactors] and one in China, the demonstration High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) at the Shidaowan site in Shandong province. It also considers a fourth – the CAREM-25 SMR under construction in Argentina.",
            "It says costs for all four [three] have been significantly higher than originally planned. “The takeaway is that the projected costs significantly understated actual construction expenditures.” However, the report does not take into account that these are all first-of-a-kind (FOAK) designs and have become the basis of further plants. Russia is already building several SMRs (both floating and land based) in almost series production using upgraded reactors based on the Akademik Lomosonov experience, the costs of which will be greatly reduced. China’s HTR-PM has become the basis for a novel district heating scheme and a larger HTGR is now being developed based on this experience. The CAREM 25 has faced delays and cost overruns but is now expected to begin operation in 2027. Both Russia and Argentina expect their designs to be the basis for lucrative exports in the future.",
            "IEEFA says two other SMRs currently under construction in China and Russia are also years behind schedule. “Russia’s BREST-300 lead-cooled reactor is now scheduled for completion in 2026, even though announcements in the early 2010s had indicated it would be operational by 2018. Similarly, China’s ACP100, a 125MW pressurized water SMR that has been under development since the early 2010s, is now not scheduled to begin commercial operation until 2026.” These are also FOAK designs for which delays are par for the course and will ultimately offer opportunities for replication and exports.",
            "IEEFA notes that similar significant cost increases have occurred at proposed projects in the US, citing the cancellation of NuScale’s planned facility in Idaho in cooperation with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "The report notes: “NuScale’s problems are not unique. US SMR developers have consistently sought to shield their construction cost estimates, but information about two other prominent projects shows that the estimated costs for these projects also have skyrocketed. The cost increases for the X-Energy and GE-Hitachi SMR projects occurred well before either had secured licensing approval from NRC [National Regulatory Authority], let alone begun construction. IEEFA believes this should be a red flag for utilities, regulators and investors.",
            "IEEFA says the cost debate “inevitably includes Westinghouse, the developer of the two AP1000 reactors recently brought online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle nuclear facility”, which was more than $20bn over budget and took more than six years longer to complete than forecast. “Undaunted by that debacle, Westinghouse has now jumped into the SMR market, introducing a 300MW unit (the AP300) that it says it can build for $3,333 per kW- even though the final cost of the Vogtle reactors was more than $20,000 per kW in 2023-year dollars. Even if Westinghouse’s projected AP300 cost is just an overnight estimate that excludes escalation and financing costs, that is a spectacular projected cost reduction for a facility that is still not licensed and far from breaking ground for construction.”",
            "In terms of the projects being “too slow”, the report, referring to the same projects, notes that they all took longer to build than planned. Again, with respect to the Russian and Chinese plants, this was not a real consideration as it is expected for FOAK projects.",
            "However, for those still in the design stage, IEEFA may have a point. “Despite this real-world experience, Westinghouse, X-Energy and NuScale, among others, continue to claim they will be able to construct their SMRs in 36 to 48 months, perhaps quickly enough to have them online by 2030,” the report notes. “GE-Hitachi even claims it ultimately will be able to construct its 300MW facility in as little as 24 months. Admittedly, there is a not-zero chance this is possible, but it flies in the face of nuclear industry experience, both in terms of past SMR development and construction efforts and the larger universe of full-size reactors, all of which have taken significantly longer than projected to begin commercial operation.”",
            "As to the projects being “too risky”, IEEFA simply says the cost increases and construction delays that have plagued the SMR sector already “will push enormous financial and time risks onto",
            "customers, potentially undercutting their interest and ability in pursuing such projects. Aware of these risk-related problems, the Department of Energy has floated several ideas to get the government involved in the buildout of the SMR sector. These include providing “cost overrun insurance,” other undefined financial assistance, becoming an owner or serving as a buyer for the power. None of these options would reduce the development risk—they would simply transfer those risks and the associated costs to US taxpayers",
            "In conclusion, IEEFA says it released its first analysis of the SMR sector more than two years ago, “concluding that the much-hyped resource would be too slow, too expensive and too risky to help in the transition away from fossil fuels”. It added: “We stand by that conclusion.”",
            "The report notes: “Perhaps most concerning is the risk factor, especially when compared to the known costs and construction timelines for readily available wind, solar and battery storage resources. … At least 375,000 MW of new renewable energy generating capacity is likely to be added to the US grid in the next seven years. By contrast, IEEFA believes it is highly unlikely any SMRs will be brought online in that same time frame. The comparison couldn’t be clearer. Regulators, utilities, investors and government officials should acknowledge this and embrace the available reality: Renewables are the near-term solution.”",
            "The report makes several recommendations:",
            "Regulators who will be asked to approve utility or developer-backed SMR proposals should craft restrictions to prevent delays and cost increases from being pushed onto ratepayers.",
            "Utilities that are considering SMRs should be required to compare the technology’s uncertain costs and completion dates with the known costs and construction timetables of renewable alternatives. Utilities that still opt for the SMR option should be required to put shareholder funds at risk if costs and construction times exceed utility estimates.",
            "Investors and bankers weighing any SMR proposal should carefully conduct their due diligence. Things will go wrong, imperiling the chances for full recovery of any invested funds.",
            "State and federal governments should require that estimated SMR construction costs and schedules be publicly available so that utility ratepayers, taxpayers and investors are better able to assess the magnitude of the SMR-related financial risks that they may be forced to bear.",
            "Finally, it is vital that this debate consider the opportunity costs associated with the SMR push. The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years—years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.",
            "IEEFA says its mission “is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy”. It adds that its market-based research “shows how the rise of the new energy economy, where renewable energy sources are steadily eroding reliance on fossil fuels, makes financial sense for investors, governments, businesses, communities and ratepayers”.",
            "In line with this mission, the new report says: “The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years – years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.”"

The announcements were made at the Africa Nuclear Business Platform meeting in Accra.",
            "The statement from the US Embassy in Ghana said: US SMRs incorporate advanced safety features, including designs to withstand extreme weather and seismic events, and can be tailored to match the specific needs of a country’s power grid, with the ability to scale up as needed. Importantly, SMRs can play a critical role in decarbonising non-electric sectors, such as industry and transportation.”",

The documents, signed by GAEC and ISTC and by GAEC, ISTC and NuScale, respectively, “advance Ghana’s technical readiness for SMR technology”. The Embassy statement says “the deployment of a NuScale E2 Center in Ghana — a first for the African continent — will be a key tool for preparing the workforce for SMR deployment in Ghana and beyond”.",
            "The E2 Center, a simulator of NuScale Power’s SMR control room, funded by the FIRST programme, will provide a hands-on training facility to develop and train the next generation nuclear operators and engineers.

            "The United States is also currently in negotiations with Ghana for a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement (or 123 agreement) and looks forward to concluding negotiations to enable closer cooperation in this important field.",
            "The US Embassy in Ghana in March 2022 announced that the USA and Ghana have jointly launched a partnership under the FIRST programme. “The FIRST programme, led by the US Department of State, will support Ghana’s adoption of small modular reactor (SMR) technology, including support for stakeholder engagement, advanced technical collaboration, and project evaluation and planning,” the Embassy noted at that time. The State Department launch the FIRST programme in April 2021 “building on more than 60 years of US innovation and expertise in nuclear energy” with initial funding of $5.3m."

            "“This may be a bit extreme, but radiation is definitely far worse”",
            "The climate crisis has prompted a reappraisal of nuclear generation with its low- carbon credentials but to deliver on this promise means a robust approach to embracing resilience too. Nuclear has inherent capabilities to address growing climate risk – the industry needs to make sure that the message is getting through",
            "By David Hess, Senior VP, DeepGeo",
            "Last year was the hottest one on record by an unexpectedly large margin. It is unclear what this means. Perhaps the result was a statistical outlier, the kind of fluctuation that it is to be expected when you track an apparently smooth trend over time. Then again, perhaps it was not.",
            "Some people have postulated that this could reflect an acceleration in the planetary temperature rise.",
            "For example, YouTube physicist Sabine Hossenfelder posted a video in March titled: “I wasn’t worried about climate change. Now I am”. This questioned whether leading climate scientists and institutions were wrong about the key sensitivity parameters, quoting research involving the eminent James Hansen. At last count the video had garnered over 1.6 million views.",
            "This defies a comforting narrative which had emerged in the last couple of years suggesting that perhaps we had climate change under control. While confining temperatures beneath 2°C (and certainly 1.5°C) is broadly acknowledged as unrealistic – good for target setting but not on track for being met – an influential group of experts had started to converge on a number somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5°C as the likely limit over pre-industrial times.",
            "Humanity, it seems, had turned a corner and the controversial RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathways) scenarios found in the IPCC reports could no longer be justified. The impending doom of climate change became measurable and controllable. The fatalism frequently voiced by today’s youth became unfounded.",
            "In 2019, Breakthrough Institute director Ted Nordhaus came up with the analogy of climate change being diabetes for the planet. Yes, still a serious condition, but the remedy was not radical untested medicine. Rather it was the slow and steady planetary equivalent of changing diet, exercise, blood monitoring and regular insulin injections. In this case decarbonisation, electrification and a technology-inclusive, steady approach.",
            "Last year then was a wake-up call. A reminder that even given recent progress governments can’t afford to be complacent. The climate is unsurprisingly a complex system and what we don’t know can – and in all likelihood will – hurt us. So, they must continue to pick up the pace on mitigation efforts. Equally though, they must be more ready than ever to promote investment in the adaptation solutions needed for a climate-changed world.",
            "Among other things, investing in adaption means investing in energy. Energy is the great enabler of modernity and all the comforts and security that brings. In some regions this means building up more energy supplies to meet growing need for air conditioning. In others it means creating a more resilient grid that can withstand an increased intensity (and possibly frequency) of severe storms and climate events.",
            "While the nuclear industry has essentially won the battle for recognition of being a low carbon energy technology and necessary for net-zero at last year’s COP, it has arguably not won the battle of being recognised for its climate resilience attributes and being necessary for adaptation. This is fast becoming a new battleground.",
            "In fact, nuclear plants have been attacked as particularly vulnerable to climate change by the likes of Paul Dorfman, who claims that surging coastal swells and rising oceans could cause a nuclear accident. It has been suggested that wildfires could threaten plants, as could heavier flooding.",
            "There are some individuals and groups that, predictably enough, try to paint the future as one that is too dangerous for nuclear plants to operate in.",
            "This take is naïve. Nuclear operators and regulators will adjust to mitigate any genuine climate risk, just as they mitigate others. Even accounting for the sharp rise in temperature last year, the rate of increase is relatively slow and allows ample time to act. There is simply no urgent reason to shut down existing plants and certainly no reason to prevent new build, where developers will make a full assessment of climate scenarios.",
            "This take is also absurd and ignores the far greater impacts these climate events would surely have on major population centres. Why focus fear solely on nuclear facilities when the weather of such a world would kills thousands and displace millions?",
            "Even where there is no radiological threat, antis point out that there is still a threat as warming waters force nuclear plants to idle during hot water spells. Here at least they have some evidence as the number of forced outages at French nuclear plants (especially) has increased and become an annual media event. Stanford University Professor Mark Jacobson has leant on this as an argument that nuclear has no role to play in the low-carbon future, as it simply cannot be counted on. So much for nuclear reliability!",
            "The banal truth is that no energy source likes the extreme heat and this is why we need to engineer resilient energy systems. Nuclear actually performs better than most renewables during hot spells. In fact, the energy loss of heat-related nuclear outages is imperceptible in global capacity factor figures. It is lost in the noise of strong overall fleet performance. It is entirely possible that performance of the global nuclear fleet will improve in coming years, despite weather disruptions, as lagging operators gradually catch up to best-performers by improving completion of planned outages and reducing the number of unplanned ones.",
            "On the other hand, hydropower output can be devastated by drought, as Brazil has experienced. Evidence also shows that, in Europe at least, the wind often goes away during hot spells. A wind drought to accompany a water one. Solar panels too are less efficient at higher temperatures.",
            "Nuclear is also the only low-carbon energy source that can readily engineer-in greater protection against hot spells, putting in HVAC. If ever truly needed many plants could presumably construct cooling towers in case of permanently lessened water availability. Nuclear plants are also naturally resistant to storm threats in a way that wind turbine and solar panels will never be.",
            "But industry shouldn’t dismiss these climate-related criticisms out of hand. Being resistant to damage from certain weather threats is not the same thing as boosting overall energy resilience. The energy system is only as strong as its weakest link, and during a storm that link is the grid itself.",
            "In fact, nuclear plants will often go offline as a precaution against a cyclone or flood, before the event even reaches them. This is a shame really, as it’s hard to think of a time when that energy might be more desperately needed.",
            "The other part of resilience is recovery, and here too some of the criticism sticks. If there is a grid disruption most of today’s nuclear plants must go into shut down. They will also be the last facilities to come back online as a stable external power supply is a safety perquisite.",
            "Continuing a theme, nuclear technology and operations simply have to step up to meet the needs of a climate- changed world where fossil fuels are all but phased out. One farsighted academic has pioneered work in the subject of how to make nuclear energy more resilient, and the industry should make itself more familiar with the work of Sherrell Greene.",
            "Focusing on two items on the wish list. The ability for future reactors to operate in island mode and to provide black-start capability to the grid could become immensely valuable. Fortunately, this is a feature that is expected of SMR technologies and indeed some vendors (notably NuScale) have marketed this.",
            "If climate change and the need to adapt is the entry point for nuclear resilience, it is certainly not the only external threat industry should be bracing for. The last five years suggest that we are now living through a period where various disruptions are more frequent. The world has bounced from a pandemic, to a commodity and energy crisis, and now faces greater geopolitical instability and the prospect of regional conflicts. Cyber security is an ever greater concern. Who really knows what tomorrow will bring?",
            "We may not all be heading towards the end of days, but we do appear to be living through ‘interesting times’. As an industry obsessed by risk, the nuclear sector is already well-placed to adapt accordingly. Nuclear technologies and the industry itself are indeed crucial to global adaptation efforts."

        "text": [
            "Impressive recent growth in the SMR project pipeline is just one more element of a tidal wave forming for the next great nuclear breakthrough.",
            "In the first quarter of 2024 the small nuclear reactor (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW. This, according to a new report from analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, represents growth of some 65% in the three years since 2021.",
            "Noting that just five countries lead the project pipeline – Canada, the Korean Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States are driving some 58% of those projects – the WoodMac analysis adds that even the current global project pipeline would require an investment of close to US$176bn.",
            "It’s clearly a substantial growth rate and is backed by serious investment, even if the whole extent of the current pipeline never reaches a positive final investment decision. And it’s a district possibility, if not outright probability, that such a situation may come to pass as some of these projects fall by the wayside. After all, there are obvious risks to consider, particularly in light of the high profile NuScale retrenchment. As an industry leader – and still the only SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – NuScale had been widely seen as something of a flag-bearer for this burgeoning new nuclear industry.",
            "It’s understandable then that the decision to abandon the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) being developed in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) was taken by many as a significant blow to the credibility of SMRs as a whole.",
            "However, to reach that conclusion would undoubtedly be an ill-considered approach. NuScale may have taken a step backwards, but it is hardly in full-blown retreat. Almost immediately after the CFPP decision was announced Standard Power revealed plans to work with NuScale to develop two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Standard business is as a provider of services to data companies and this may be taken as a giant neon sign pointing to at least one of the underlying drivers behind a global SMR boom. The unabated growth of energy-hungry data centres is likely to see an early and productive partnership between the two industries. They certainly won’t be alone though, given Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also the founder of Terrapower with its 345 MWe Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor technology.",
            "There’s other clear evidence of gathering momentum behind an SMR-led nuclear market too. With multiple policy initiatives reflecting a new appraisal of nuclear in general, there are also SMR-specific government-backed measures designed to push SMR technologies off the drawing board and into operation. Important regulatory efforts underway include the US NRC, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) recently signing a trilateral deal to collaborate on SMR and advanced modular reactor (AMR) design assessment. The agreement is designed to enable both good practice and experience of reviewing SMR/AMR designs to be shared between the regulators. All three bodies are already engaged with SMR design assessment – the NRC is conducting pre-application activities with Westinghouse regarding design certification for its AP300 SMR, as well as with Holtec International for its SMR 300, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear for licensing approval of its BWRX-300 design, for example. This new measure marks an important step toward a unified regulatory framework that is so important to the success of SMRs that are expected to be deployed in many different jurisdictions.",
            "Given the underlying fundamentals it’s perhaps not so surprising that in their net zero scenario, WoodMac sees SMRs accounting for around a third of the global nuclear fleet. It’s not a cloudless horizon, inevitably there are both economic and technical risks and challenges that must be overcome and to do so will require a long-term concerted effort from government, regulators and the private sector. But taken in the round there is every indication that the 65% growth in the project pipeline seen over the last three years will come to be regarded as a pretty poor show in the years that follow."

Higher net loss reported in the period “was driven by a one-time $3.2m charge associated with continuing our transition from an R&D-based company to commercial operations, and a $9.0m non-cash adjustment to the fair value of our warrants due to an increase in the Company’s share price”.",
            "“The criticality of NuScale’s near-term deployable SMR (small modular reactor) technology has never been greater than amidst today’s rapidly expanding power demand landscape,” said NuScale President & CEO John Hopkins. “Both government and private sectors are struggling with the balance of achieving carbon reduction pledges amidst unprecedented growth in energy usage driven by the emergence of hyperscale data centres, artificial intelligence networks, and the industries supporting them.”",

            "However, Rolls-Royce says it no longer has time to build it and make the first pressure vessels by the early 2030s when it had hoped to launch its first SMRs. Rolls-Royce will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third-party supplier. Plans for the second factory will still go ahead. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce SMR told the Daily Telegraph that the company had now “prioritised work on our modules assembly and test facility”. It added: “Our efforts are focused on identifying the best site to support our deployment at pace.”",
            "The sites considered for the pressure vessel factory could now be shortlisted for the second plant, but no decision has yet been made. The company may revive plans for a heavy pressure vessel factory sometime in the future, provided that it manages to build up a robust pipeline of orders. A UK government spokesman said: “Our world leading SMR competition aims to be the fastest of its kind, helping secure billions in investment for the UK, meaning cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term.”",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWt. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK.",

The site is well known for its first reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I), which started operations in December 1951. EBR-I was the first nuclear reactor to produce usable amounts of electricity. The reactor was also novel in that it used a liquid metal coolant and operated using a fast neutron spectrum that enabled demonstration of nuclear fuel breeding, a key concept for maximizing uranium resource use. Over the ensuing decades, 52 reactors were operated on the site establishing the technical and scientific basis that underpins the safe operation of our current commercial reactors as well as for the development of future advanced reactor concepts.

        "text": [
            "UK-based Sheffield Forgemasters has been awarded a strategic nuclear qualification, which the company says positions it to support development and delivery of the next generation of civil NPPs. The nuclear qualification came after an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III Division I NCA 3300 (NCA 3800), NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations.",
            "Ian Nicholls, group technical director, at Sheffield Forgemasters, said, “We undertook the ASME audit in November and have now received confirmation that the audit recommendation has been approved by the committee. The accreditation is a huge development with heightened requirements and protocols embracing all our processes, employees and selected sub-suppliers.”",
            "The qualification followed the company’s announcement of a ground-breaking development in the acceleration of welding for large nuclear vessels, using Electron Beam Welding to reduce more than a year’s worth of manual welding to less than 24 hours. In February Sheffield Forgemasters completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW).",
            "Nicholls added: “The ASME accreditation, coupled with our development of Electron Beam Welding for large diameter, nuclear grade vessels, places Sheffield Forgemasters at the pinnacle of development for small modular reactors and presents significant possibilities for the UK’s domestic nuclear new-build programme.”",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters is the only company in the UK capable of manufacturing reactor vessel components for SMRs, and this together with the ASME status, gives the company capability in delivery of advanced power-generation technology. As well as being the sole UK supplier of large, nuclear-grade forgings and castings, Sheffield Forgemasters’ MO and NPT status now makes it one of the only UK companies qualified for fabrication of the main components within a civil NPP.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters. which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, first gained ASME accreditation as a Nuclear Materials Organisation in 1992 but it had lapsed, with the lack of nuclear new-build in subsequent years. The ASME code is the most comprehensive series of guidelines for civil nuclear manufacture in the world with an emphasis on doctrines that have parallels with the European Nuclear manufacturing code, RCC-M, and other submarine nuclear standards.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK.

In July 2016, Sheffield Forgemasters and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet.

            "There is no technology development more important to the future of the nuclear industry than widescale deployment of SMRs. Long promised, these designs do not represent a fad, they are completely integral to the future of nuclear energy and complementary to larger designs.",
            "Stick around in the nuclear industry long enough and you are bound to become a cynic. Many join the industry as starry-eyed optimists and idealists, but over time – the looong timescale of nuclear policy and project developments – that spirit fades. Look at the big picture and ask yourself how much has really changed in the last 20 years? In many nuclear countries, and specifically Western ones, what you will see is a litany of premature plant closures and stalled new-build programmes.",
            "At conferences, the industry comforts itself with stories of advanced technology messiahs, but where are they? Most seem to have got lost in the journey from paper to steel and concrete, or at best stuck at one government-funded demonstration unit. As for the newer reactor designs that have actually been constructed, overwhelmingly they are evolutions of large light water reactor technologies. Overwhelmingly the construction performance and numbers built have been underwhelming.",
            "It is easy to become jaded and convinced that nothing will change in the nuclear industry, to become closed to the idea of it. But if enough folk get trapped in this fatalism then the industry will decay as surely as the radioactive isotopes it handles. Change is necessary, it is welcome, and of these potential changes none are more important to the future of nuclear than the development of SMRs. While the pathway to SMR deployment has been torturously long, the impacts stand to redefine the sector.",
            "Take a moment to reflect on what SMRs really represent. We used to talk of nuclear technology developments primarily in terms of Gen IV reactors – molten salt, sodium-cooled fast spectrum, etc. Today, it is customary to at least start these conversations with a description of reactor size and potential applications. This simple change normalises nuclear and makes it understandable to a larger public, no longer solely the domain of scientists, engineers and nerds.",
            "There is an ongoing debate about whether SMRs will ever be able to compete with large reactor designs, whether economies of factory production, easier financing and standardisation will ever be able to compensate for lost economies of scale. While this debate is valid it is a mistake to think there is a single answer. The factors influencing nuclear economics and construction success are different country by country. They include things such as the established industrial base, labour costs, regulatory approach, market structure, and much more. What’s true in the USA is unlikely to be true in Europe and certainly won’t be true in South Korea or African countries. Of these, market factors will probably have the largest impact on whether SMRs or large reactors are more competitive and become the focus in the near term.",
            "This debate often misses something more fundamental. This is not an apples for apples comparison. SMRs promise to provide more than just grid-scale electricity. Their size and design allows them to be placed in new settings – next to industrial centres, in remote communities, on ships.",
            "They can readily provide heat, hydrogen and motive force in addition to electricity. SMRs radically expand the market envelope of nuclear energy, and this is profoundly more important than the relative economics between large and small. What is most likely to determine the success of any given SMR design/designer is whether it successfully identifies a market niche, meets the requirements of customers and forms partnerships with a competent supply base.",
            "The key universal benefit that SMRs offer is flexibility, not cost. Flexibility here defined in a broad sense and including application, siting, output (load following) and even flexibility of financing. People don’t expect a sports car to be cheaper per person mile travelled than a bus. It’s curious that this expectation exists for SMRs.",
            "Individual SMR designs that promise to do everything whilst also being radically cheaper deserve scepticism. There is a hint of snake oil in the SMR space. This is natural and to be expected in a competitive start-up sector. More generally though, where industry scepticism towards SMRs used to make sense 10 or so years ago, it simply does not now. It frankly makes more sense to be sceptical of large reactor projects in Western countries than SMRs, given announcement after announcement of disappointing construction performance.",
            "This remains true even in light of the cancellation of the NuScale and UAMP Carbon Free Power Project and the recent news that some other Western SMR starts-ups have recently had to scale back or change financial partners.",
            "In the commercial-led approach to SMR technology deployment the path was always going to be bumpy. Consolidation is to be expected sooner or later. The question is whether governments take a hand in down-selecting certain promising designs and vendors, or just leave the emerging sector to struggle on.",
            "And, for the avoidance of doubt – yes, we will need both large and small reactors in the coming decades. SMRs are inherently more complementary to large reactors than they are to be considered competition. Indeed, some visionaries have outlined a scenario where the deployment of SMRs allows companies (and countries) to regain the necessary nuclear competencies in a manner that doesn’t bet the farm, and that will eventually allow them to build large reactors efficiently again.",
            "SMRs have clearly now become the buzzword in nuclear innovation and the badge under which advanced reactor technologies are expected to be researched and developed. While it is a bit silly to hit all technologies with an arbitrary 300 MW size limit and insist on an automated manufacturing approach, it also tolerable if it secures funding and allows progress to be made.",
            "The other crucial innovation that SMRs unlock is in business models. Microreactors are especially noteworthy, with vendors proposing reactor leasing arrangements. The idea of sending an assembled and fuelled reactor to a site, plugging it in, using it for a while and then transporting it away – all whilst never operating/refuelling/maintaining it themselves – is clearly a tantalising one. Big tech especially is paying close attention.",
            "SMRs bring the innovation to the nuclear industry and make it sexy again. But equally they demand innovation from other parts of the fuel cycle and the industry’s supporting bodies. This may now be the primary challenge standing in the way of successful SMR deployment. Regulators especially have proven slow and reluctant to approve crucial enabling features and certify novel designs. Even more disappointing has been the continued snail’s pace on international harmonisation and design certification.",
            "In terms of fuel supply the lack of HALEU and facilities ready to produce this is a well-known bottle neck. But we also need to see the same culture of innovation emerge in the back end – in waste management, reprocessing and disposal – if the real potential of SMRs and a more flexible and adaptive nuclear sector are to be unleashed.",
            "In case you missed it, SMRs are no longer future technology. They are part of the fabric of nuclear sector today. The SMR age officially began on 19 December 2019 when the twin reactors on the Akademik Lomonosov started providing electricity (and later heat) to Pevek. It was further cemented when the high temperature gas cooled reactors connected to the grid in Shidaowan. China and Russia have realised the SMR promise and are set to build more. As usual, other countries are struggling to catch up.",
            "Maybe it’s that old idealism talking, but when those first Western SMR projects do spark up it should mark the end of the long nuclear stagnation in Europe and USA and unleash a new wave of nuclear energy development globally.",

        "text": [
            "Romania, supported by US, is to build six small modular reactors (SMRs) in the locality of Doicesti, Dambovita, some 90 kilometres from Bucharest. The reactors can power 46,000 homes and could create 4,000 jobs, amounting to an investment of $6bn partly financed by the US. The reactors, designed by US NuScale, could be operational by the end of 2029.",
            "According to Romanian Energy Minister Sebastian Burduja, the project will see Romania transformed into a leader in the nuclear field. “For too many years, we've been used to catching up, often breathlessly, behind others. It's time for us to write the future of the world,” he said. “Romania can be on the world map with the first nuclear power plant, the first small modular reactors.”",
            "Burduja said discussions with American experts and officials had confirmed the safety of the technology noting that a similar plant was to be built in the US state of Idaho, but the project was cancelled due to high costs amounting to roughly $9.2bn whereas the plant in Romania will be cheaper.",
            "“The Idaho project did not benefit from infrastructure, transformers, electrical lines, or river water. As such, it required more engineering improvements,” said Cosmin Ghita, CEO of Romania’s nuclear utility Nuclearelectrica (SNN).",
            "The US Ambassador to Bucharest, Kathleen Kavalec, announced that the US EXIM Bank and the US International Development Finance Corporation had committed to financing to ensure the success of the project in the amount of $3bn and $1bn, respectively. “Their financial investment underscores our shared commitment to a sustainable energy future. We recognise that the path to progress lies in collaboration, and this project embodies that. Works are scheduled to last until 2030.",
            "“I have just had the opportunity to tour the Doicesti Small Modular Reactor (SMR) site. The rapid progress here is a testament to Romania’s vision, guiding us toward a cleaner, more sustainable energy future,” she said in the press release. “As I have just seen, Romania is poised to become a regional clean energy hub. The Doicesti SMR project is at the forefront of this transformation.”",
            "She continued: “Experience has shown that the American NuScale technology being used in the project is safe. As the sole existing commercial SMR technology approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it comes with assurances of the highest levels of safety and security. The United States is committed to deploying these types of cutting-edge solutions to combat the climate crisis and expand access to clean energy.”",
            "She said the US Embassy team “collaborates daily with SNN, RoPower, NuScale, and Fluor – the driving forces behind Doicesti’s transformation, to move this project forward. Together, we can make Doicesti a shining star in the constellation of carbon-free energy generation”.",

            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report: ‘",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets",
            "’ which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector’s progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale’s pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance.",
            "It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale’s VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "Above: Relative latecomers are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector’s early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

            "Reporting its fourth quarter and full year results for 2023, US-based NuScale Power said progress continued toward “commercialisation of small modular reactor (SMR) technology to meet consumer demand for safe, reliable, 24/7 and carbon-free baseload energy”.",
            "NuScale President & CEO John Hopkins said over the course of 2023, “we made significant progress towards commercializing our SMR technology, including continued activities to ensure readiness for manufacturing of our first NuScale Power Modules, building traction amongst data centres and further developing industrial applications for SMRs, such as process heat, hydrogen, and ammonia production”.",
            "He added: “Additionally, as the first and only SMR to receive US Nuclear Regulatory Commission design approval and certification and have Long Lead Materials in production, NuScale maintains our position as the global first mover in commercial SMR development. We continue to receive serious interest from major technology and industrial companies, utilities, national and local governments, and others seeking 24/7 clean, reliable energy and process heat.”",
            "The NuScale SMR is a 77 MWe (250 MWt) pressurised water reactor (PWR) designed to be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGR SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. NuScale says its SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries. However, the first project, which was expected to begin operation in 2029 in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) at the US Department of Energy's (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as part of the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) was cancelled.",
            "“Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough subscription to continue toward deployment,” a joint statement said at the time. NuScale had already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components or the project and South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility had begun producing forgings for the plant. Other projects are planned in Poland and Romania.",
            "In its Business Update, NuScale listed the following progress:",
            "In Romania, the RoPower project is working to advance into the next phase of development by initiating Phase 2 Front-End Engineering and Design.",
            "NuScale technology was selected by Standard Power to support the development of two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The facilities are planned to produce nearly 2 GWe through the deployment of 24 NuScale Power Modules.",
            "Standard Design Approval (SDA) application for an uprated 77 MWe module design was accepted for review by NRC in July 2023 and NuScale received a schedule for an anticipated 24-month review process. The increased power output will support the capacity needs of a wider range of customers with 12 modules producing nearly 1 GWe.",
            "As NuScale accelerates its commercialisation efforts, it is also initiating the manufacture of NuScale Power Modules. Notably, our supply chain partners commenced the production of long lead time components, including forgings and other materials associated with the first NuScale Power Modules.",
            "NuScale’s Financial Update said the balance sheet includes cash and equivalents of $125.4m ($5.1m of which is restricted), and no debt. “In response to the burgeoning market opportunities and the reality of lengthy sales and development cycles, in January 2024, NuScale announced cost efficiency actions projected to result in approximately $50-60m in annualised savings. [This was immediately after the collapse of the UAMPS project]. The Company is redirecting resources to the most immediate commercial opportunities with a focus on advancing revenue-generating projects, securing new orders and positioning NuScale towards long-term success.”",
            "NuScale reported revenue of $4.6m and net loss of $56.4m for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, compared with revenue of $3.4m and a net loss of $47.2m, respectively, for the same period in 2022. Revenue of $22.8m and a net loss of $180.1m for the 12-month period ended 31 December 2023, compared with revenue of $11.8m and a net loss of $141.6m for the same period in 2022.",
            "NuScale had more than 550 employees at the start of 2023. Its headquarters are in Portland, Oregan but most of the staff are in Corvallis. NuScale’s actions following the UAMPS included a reported workforce reduction of 154 full-time employees.",

The event was hosted at the Korean Embassy in London by Ambassador Yoon Yeocheol and attended by UK Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to Korea, Sir John Whittingdale MP.",
            "The partnerships are a further step towards delivery of Holtec’s SMR-300 technology in the UK. The SMR-300 is a pressurised water reactor (PWR) using technology based on existing standards in the US and UK and uses PWR fuel similar to that already used at Sizewell B, and other new UK reactors under development including Hinkley Point C. Holtec has been developing its SMR since 2011. The SMR-300 has undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "In December 2023, Holtec Britain was awarded £30m ($37.6m) of grant funding from the UK government’s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to complete Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of the SMR-300, which was also shortlisted by Great British Nuclear (GBN) at the end of October 2023. The other five short-listed companies are Rolls Royce SMR, EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. If successful in the Great British Nuclear SMR competition, Holtec plans to establish a factory in the UK to build the major mechanical SMR components and support other aligned manufacturing needs in clean energy and defence sectors.",
            "Holtec says an exercise to find the best location for a factory will be launched in the coming weeks. If established, the factory will support deployment of 5 GW of on-grid UK electricity from SMR-300 by 2050 and create a major export hub. Holtec Britain’s Senior Advisor, Professor Dame Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge stated, “Holtec is committed to delivering SMRs in the UK creating high-value well-paid jobs and providing clean energy to help us reach net zero. This agreement is another important step on this journey.”",
            "“Based on our strong partnership with Holtec, we have prepared for the GBN SMR competition with top-tier UK construction company Balfour Beatty and world class engineering firm Mott MacDonald, giving us even more confidence in our ability to successfully win the contract and execute the project,” said Young-Joon Yoon, President & CEO and of Hyundai E&C.",
            "Balfour Beatty Group CEO Leo Quinn, said SMRs can offer a more flexible, scalable solution. He added that the partnership “is perfectly positioned to address the growing demand for clean energy in the UK and support the UK’s transition towards a Net Zero future”.",
            "Cathy Travers, Group Managing Director of Mott MacDonald said: “International collaboration from across the nuclear industry is key to its successful deployment, which is why we are bringing decades of collective experience to bear as we explore this path with Holtec Britain and Hyundai E&C.”",
            "Gareth Thomas, Director of Holtec Britain told Reuters: \"Holtec will be investing approximately £600m in the construction, design and build of a new factory and production site over the next 15 years.\" Local authorities and businesses will be invited to submit expressions of interest to host the factory, outlining which sites could be available and how ready they would be for work to start on the factory. The factory could provide around 400 highly-skilled jobs in the next three-to-five years, Thomas said. Holtec already has an SMR factory in New Jersey in the USA, but believes a UK site could provide a base to export its technology to Europe and the Middle East.",

        "text": [
            "As part of his recent UK budget statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “I can announce that this week the government has reached agreement on a £160m ($203m) deal with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site in Ynys Môn and the Oldbury site in South Gloucestershire.” This was confirmed in paragraph 5.120 of the Budget Statement. Hunt said the purchase had been made \"given the importance of securing nuclear sites for the success of the nuclear programme\".",
            "In January 2021, Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power notified the UK Planning Inspectorate that it was withdrawing its application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey where it had planned to construct a nuclear power plant with two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors. The £20bn project had been expected to provide employment and business opportunities for the region.",
            "Hitachi had announced the suspension of the project in January 2019 and its intent to withdraw entirely in September 2020. In light of this, and in the absence of a new funding policy from HM Government, Hitachi decided to wind-up Horizon as an active development entity by 31 March 2021. Hitachi continued to manage the site under the control of its subsidiary Hitachi Europe Limited. \"This will be done with a view to considering development proposals from commercial or public sector developers who may come forward, and Horizon will continue to support this intent until the end of March,” said Horizon CEO Duncan Hawthorne. “Beyond this period Hitachi Europe will remain available to respond to any parties who may have an interest in acquiring these sites.\"",
            "In his budget speech, Hunt added that, as well as seeking a site for a new large-scale NPP, \"the government is now moving to the next stage of the SMR process, with six companies invited to submit their initial tender responses by June this year\". He added that \"no decisions have been taken on projects\". The government earlier outlined plans to increase nuclear energy capacity to 24 GWe by 2050, with a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of that strategy. In 2023, the government and the new Great British Nuclear (GNB) arms-length body set up to help deliver extra nuclear capacity began the selection process for a suitable SMR technology. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of that process.",

            "The latest in the long series of nuclear technology promises, that of the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), keeps gaining potency, as illustrated by the evolution of the discourses between the 2022 and 2023 Reuters SMR and Advanced Reactor conferences. The nuclear community has been highly successful in creating a sense of urgency, in the face of climate and energy security crises, thereby lending the promise considerable legitimacy. By contrast, the road is long before the SMR promise reaches sufficient credibility – a second key success factor for any techno-scientific promise – by persuading investors and other stakeholders of the industry’s ability to deliver.",
            "The promise is facing an increasingly risky phase, as shown by the recent cancellation of the NuScale project in Idaho. The greater the expectations, the deeper is the disappointment if the hopeful discourses fail to gradually translate into policy instruments, funding schemes – and ultimately, R&D, prototype and commercial projects. Yet, the credibility and the very success of the SMR promise may matter less for a growing number of industry players and nuclear advocates who see SMRs less as an end and more as a means of getting back to the “real business” of building large reactors.",
            "Is the SMR promise legitimate?",
            "The urgency of tackling the climate change and energy security challenges has lent the SMRs the legitimacy, and hence the political support, that is vital for any techno-scientific promise. If 2022’s Atlanta conference was replete with frustration and nostalgic references to the foregone times of political leadership under the Atoms for Peace programme, last year’s motto seemed to be that the nuclear community has now won the political battle – and that “there’s no path to net zero without nuclear”. Fred Dermarkar, the President and CEO of Canada’s nuclear science and technology laboratory AECL, opened his speech with great enthusiasm: “It’s a heart-stopping historic moment!… For how long have we been asking for leadership?…Well, we have it now!” The prominent role of nuclear in the recent joint statement by PM Trudeau and President Biden on energy-sector collaboration served as a sign of political leadership. Alongside the frequent references to IEA and IPPC reports, in 2023 the speakers evoked the recent Ontario grid operator’s report, which suggests that to reach its net-zero emission target by 2050, the province could need up to 17,800 MW of new nuclear capacity, both SMRs and large reactors. Reaching the climate targets without stable nuclear baseload might be possible but extremely costly, the Atlanta speakers reasoned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the downsides of stable and rather inflexible baseload in the decentralised and renewables-dominated grids of tomorrow were not explored.",
            "Legitimacy alone is not enough, however, if the promise-makers fail to convince key stakeholders of the ability of the technology to effectively tackle the problem. The concern of the industry’s ability to deliver was even more acute in 2023 than the year before. Where to find the requisite resources and abilities to complete the SMR designs, persuade investors, rebuild supply chains, pass through the regulatory maze, and then eventually construct new reactors at the pace needed to satisfy the demand, and – according to a pledge by a group of over 20 countries at COP 28 – triple the global nuclear capacity by 2050?",
            "Historical experience of the radical downscaling of electricity growth forecasts in the mid-1970s calls for caution. Yet, if demand does indeed shootsthrough the roof, how is the SMR industry to compete with its rivals, for the needed resources, for both highly skilled and unskilled workforce?",
            "The industry question of “can we deliver?” had by 2023 surpassed the concerns for cumbersome safety regulation as an obstacle to SMR deployment. Gone were the previous year’s complaints about “too much democracy” in safety regulation, instead the regulators and government speakers now openly challenged the industry. Ramzi Jammal, Chief Regulatory Operations Officer at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), pointed out that international regulatory harmonisation was well underway, including plans to set up an International Technical Support Organization (ITSO) to assist regulators in embarking countries. Jammal had a scathing message to the industry: “You are behind us, let me tell you bluntly… Get your act together, standardise the codes and move on in that direction. Otherwise, you are going to get something you are not going to like!”. Björn Peters, the co-founder of Dual Fluid, developing a lead-cooled SMR, echoed Jammal: once the industry comes up with a truly good design, “licensing will follow, politics will follow”, but the real challenge is to “convince… in each utility the top 20 people or so to buy a few” reactors.",
            "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Julie Kozeracki made an almost desperate plea for action: “At LPO (DOE’s Loan Programs Office), I have 300 billion dollars in loans that almost nobody wants, for nuclear deployment.” With a pinch of sarcasm, Kozeracki noted that “the nuclear industry really loves press releases, they love MoUs, they love letters of intent. But I can’t finance a supply chain or build a workforce on a press release. I need signed contracts!”",
            "The SMR promise is still far from proving its credibility in the eyes of investors. Symptomatic was that Westinghouse, with its AP300, had replaced NuScale as the 2023 conference’s opening showcase. NuScale’s recent troubles – the steady decline of its share price since August 2022, the cancellation in November 2023 of its planned first-of-a-kind project in Idaho, for the lack of subscribers – illustrate the fragility of the promise of new, even light-water, reactor designs. The absence of Rolls-Royce, another posterchild from the 2022 conference, points in the same direction.",
            "But why should investors believe that this time all will be different, that the industry has learned its lessons and that SMR projects will not run vastly over time and over budget, like the recent AP1000s in the US and EPRs in Europe? By educating the finance community, answered Kalev Kallemets, director of the Estonian SMR start-up Fermi Energia. “The public has moved on, but the financing has not… in nuclear, we are living in the post-traumas. It’s important to bring that very conservative field of finance also to the 21st century.” However, the recipe based on the “deficit model” – that citizens must be educated, and thus liberated from their “irrational fears” – has not worked with the general public and is unlike to work with the finance community. A more serious initiative is the plan to establish an International Bank for Nuclear Investment (IBNI), presented in Atlanta by its chairman Daniel Dean as a “long-term partner and pro-industry, pro-market and pro-investor supporter and enabler of SMR/Gen IV stakeholders”. Crucially, IBNI would establish “a globally recognised and harmonised” set of standards and criteria for SMR technologies, thereby seeking to help scale-up and commodify SMR delivery across the world.",
            "Consultants and pro-nuclear climate activists Kirsty Gogan and Eric Ingersoll, from Terra Praxis, painted even bolder visions of scaling up via “productisation”. Their vision of a move away from cumbersome, risky, and difficult-to-finance one-off projects towards modular factory production is elemental to the SMR promise. Turning the vision into practice may be difficult. Even SMR advocates have shown scepticism towards the idea of modularity as factory production. Many prominent nuclear-sector cheerleaders on social media are equally critical.",
            "Exploiting the window of opportunity",
            "Being able to deliver is fundamental, yet the Atlanta 2023 speakers stressed that doing it fast is vital. “We must build reactors now!”, said Fred Dermarkar from the AECL, “to show that we can deliver”, not least to enable the nuclear industry to stay in the game. The creation of IBNI may help, but even there, timelines are becoming stretched, with plans to have the Bank operational by 2026. Views diverge on what the current “window of opportunity” for SMRs in fact consists of. For some, it is the growing public acceptance, spurred by climate change and energy security concerns, and the fading of the memories of the Fukushima disaster. For others, the opportunity lies in the unprecedented yet ever so fragile political demand and leadership. Many nuclear critics argue that the development of battery technologies, grid management and demand-side solutions will soon close the “window” and render SMRs uncompetitive with renewables. In contrast, and echoing the general sentiment in Atlanta, Julie Kozeracki argued that nuclear does not even need to compete with renewables but instead with “other clean, firm options” such as “solar with really long-duration storage, or natural gas with carbon capture, geothermal, or hydropower”.",
            "Instead of safety regulation, the lengthy siting procedures and impact assessments were at the 2023 conference highlighted as a major obstacle to fast delivery of SMRs. Great hopes were placed on repurposing former coal or decommissioned nuclear sites, which could help cut down the planning, assessment and site preparation time down to 4-5 years from the current 8-9 years. However, Scott Hunnewell, Vice President of the New Nuclear Program at the TVA, reminded delegates of the difficulties of repurposing, including the highly distinct requirements and conditions for coal and nuclear sites. Public acceptance cannot be taken for granted either, even in communities with populations desperate for new economic activity and familiar with risky industries.",
            "The question haunting the 2022 conference was that of leadership: who is to move first and commit to an SMR project? A year later, Canada, with supply chains in shape – largely thanks to the recent and ongoing refurbishments – had consolidated its role as a potential leader of yet another promised nuclear renaissance in the West. “The world is looking to Canada!,” exclaimed Brian Fehrenbach, Director of Business Development at the Organisation Canadian Nuclear Industries (OCNI). More accurate might be to say that all eyes are on Ontario, where OPG is to construct a first-of-a-kind GE Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Darlington nuclear site, with the expected completion date of 2028. The announced timetable has not slipped, yet. Empirical evidence on costs and feasibility, based on this project, were to precede any commitment to a wider SMR programme, yet in July 2023, the Ontario provincial government jumped the gun, by confirming OPG’s plan to build three additional BWRX-300s on the same site. SaskPower is eagerly waiting for cost experience from the OPG, to decide in 2029 whether to follow suit and launch the construction of four BWRX-300s.",
            "Most of the leading SMR designs may be foreign, especially American, but the Canadian government’s commitment to nuclear is arguably stronger than ever.",
            "The policy frameworks and collaborative networks (SMR Roadmap, Action Plan, strategic plan, and feasibility study) are there, laying the basis for the three “streams” of SMR development – light-water SMRs for grid electricity, advanced designs mainly for industrial heat and power, and micro-SMRs for off-grid uses in remote communities.",
            "But have the Canadians learned from past policy failures? Has the country left behind its policy tradition that political scientists Michael Howlett and Andrea Migone have characterised as one of “overpromising and underdelivering”? Are the supportive discourse, creation of networks, and relatively modest financial support simply just another way of “kicking the can down the road” rather than a determined strategy? Sceptics predict a similar fate for SMRs as that which befell the nearly mythical Arrow aircraft carrier, supposed to consolidate Canadian technological leadership in the 1950s. The then Prime Minister Diefenbaker abruptly stopped the vast technology programme in 1959, arguing that rapid changes in geopolitics and technology had made Arrow obsolete. According to rumours, pressure from Americans unwilling to face competition from their northern neighbour was a vital contributing factor. The SMR promise will end like the Arrow did, critics argue: the Americans will, in the end, snatch the markets and put the Canadians back to their place.",
            "SMRs: A stepping stone back to megaprojects?",
            "For many in the nuclear community, the SMR promise appears increasingly as an instrument, a stepping stone on the way back to constructing large reactors, rather than an end in and of itself. Last year in Atlanta an entire session, chaired by OCNI’s Fehrenbach, explored the relationships between SMRs and large nuclear reactors. While the legitimacy of the SMR promise has thus far largely relied on the notion that nuclear megaprojects are just too risky, costly, and slow, SMRs are now often portrayed as a useful, if not indispensable, bridge towards large reactor projects. As presumably safer, cheaper, and multifunctional, SMRs could help to overcome the public opposition and scepticism that has handicapped large nuclear projects, so the arguement goes. Moreover, the SMR promise helps to keep nuclear in the headlines, attract talent, and retain the skills and competences needed for the construction of large reactors – a line of reasoning particularly valid in Canada, with its home-grown CANDU knowhow and well-established nuclear institutions. Finally, enthusiasm for SMRs is partly motivated by defence interests, as highlighted by policymakers and nuclear-sector insiders.",
            "Beyond the value of the SMRs as a “stepping stone”, the rather vague overall SMR promise serves various constituencies, regardless of the actual success of any specific design. By declaring their support and providing funding for R&D into SMRs, politicians can show they are acting upon the climate and energy security challenges; the R&D community benefits from new challenges and funding opportunities; and investors can make a quick buck by speculating on the stocks of SMR companies. Vendor start-ups may be among the few for whom the success of their chosen SMR design is decisive. The instrumental value of SMRs might help explain the contradiction between the rather pessimistic evaluations of the potential economic viability of SMRs on the one hand, and the growing enthusiasm towards these technologies in the policy world on the other. What counts may not be the viability of the technology itself but instead the value that the promise itself can provide, in various ways, to the diverse involved communities.",

        "title": "NEA launches second edition of its Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",
            "Much greater technological detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. The 424 pages provide data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. However, this depends largely on information from the designers. Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines."

        "text": [
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW). Sheffield Forgemasters Research, Design & Technology Director Jesus Talamantes-Silva said the company had achieved “a significant milestone in assembling a nuclear vessel demonstrator, using electron beam welding for the first time at this scale, with 100% success and no defects”.",
            "Completing four, thick, nuclear-grade welds took less than 24 hours – work which typically requires a year. \"With a diameter of three metres and a wall thickness of 200mm, construction of the vessel showcases the reliability and capabilities of LEBW, setting a dramatic new standard for weld-joining thick-walled components, previously untrialled in a demonstrator model,\" the company noted.",
            "The operation deployed specially developed parameters, meticulously fine-tuned during the welding development stage, including innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld, ensuring a clean and complete weld-join.",
            "Senior development engineer and project lead Michael Blackmore believes the implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental, potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation. \"Not only does this reduce the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material, but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the UK and beyond, that's how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters said demonstrating LEBW technology's potential opens new horizons for \"more efficient, low-cost and less time-heavy nuclear assemblies\" with far-reaching implications for other projects which require thick-walled welded assemblies.",
            "Jacob Pope, development engineer and LEBW machine tool installation lead said: “We thank the government's Department for Energy Security & Net Zero for enabling the project through its Nuclear Innovation Programme. We also thank our esteemed partner, Cambridge Vacuum Engineering, for their invaluable support throughout this endeavour. Their remote and on-site assistance played an instrumental role in the success of this milestone, highlighting the collaborative spirit that drives us forward.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters, which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, is the only UK company able to manufacture the large forgings required for SMRs. The company said future activities include a joint industrial project “supported by key participants from the USA and UK”. The aim is “to initiate a code case or multiple cases to facilitate the deployment of this technology in accordance with the standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)”.",
            "In December, the company said it was on track to regain ASME status as a supplier of heavy forgings and castings to the civil nuclear market. An ASME Section III Division I NCA 3300, NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, has recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations. This would allow it supply castings and forgings (material) for civil nuclear applications and also be qualified to carry out weld construction activities on these materials.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK. Under the MOU, X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK.",
            "Earlier, in February 2023, the company signed an MOU with with Holtec Britain to design components for Holtec’s SMR-160 SMR and identify the best routes to manufacture. This followed similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, SFI and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 SFI signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK.",

            "“This is the first privately funded project deploying SMRs anywhere in Europe, and our goal is to be generating clean energy with in ten years’ time,” CNP noted. “There is mature market-led demand in Teesside for clean, reliable energy – in this instance a programme to build a specialised site that provides green sustainable power for the region and supports the development of a Green Energy and Chemical Hub on the North Tees Group Estate, with the ambition of producing power to liquids (e-fuels and e-chemicals) through an offtake ecosystem on the north bank of the River Tees, near Stockton-on-Tees.”",
            "CNP added that the North Tees Group Estate is reclaimed and regenerated industrial land, “and the provision of clean, always-on energy from at least four AP300s will help attract inward investment and high-value jobs”. The development will work in partnership with local business and the regional authorities.",

It is also “complementary to and supportive of Westinghouse’s participation in Great British Nuclear’s (GBN) SMR technology selection process”. It will expand “workforce, training and supply chain localisation via multiple deployment projects”.",
            "CNP CEO Paul Foster said the project “brings together Westinghouse’s proven technology and mature supply chain with our depth of expertise in nuclear programme delivery, in a region that is transforming its industrial landscape”. David Durham, Westinghouse President, Energy Systems said the AP300 SMR “is ideally suited not just to support grid generation, but also for industrial sites for generating clean and secure energy and the ability to produce hydrogen, e-fuels, desalination and district heating”.",

It will utilise identical AP1000 technology, to include major equipment, structural components, passive safety, proven fuel, and I&C systems. Westinghouse says the AP300 “will bring to bear a mature supply chain, constructability lessons learned, fast load-follow capabilities and proven O&M procedures and best practices from 18 reactor years of safe AP1000 operations.” Like the AP1000, the AP300 is designed to operate for an 80+ year life cycle.",

            "Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale’s Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: “The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren’t what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you’re grounded in the best technological positions.”",
            "Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: “In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.”",
            "that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: “The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren’t yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.”",
            "Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: “There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they’re undertaking.”",
            "However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. “The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it’s very much hinged on policy sentiment.” Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: “The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.",
            "Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. “Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.”",
            "Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.",
            "Kotak adds: “It’s exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they’re working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.”",
            "Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.",
            "The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: “Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they’re all being predicated on the fact that they’re trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that’s a positive.",
            "A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.",
            "Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.",
            "The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.",
            "“There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There’s a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,” she says.",
            "The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.",
            "Canada’s introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a ‘fundamental and necessary component’ of the low-carbon energy system.",
            "In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada’s federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.",
            "As Kotak says: “Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It’s only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.”",
            "The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project.",
            "Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH’s BWRX-300 SMR for the project.",
            "Kotak picks up on these developments: “It’s great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.”",
            "The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a ‘Nuclear Alliance’ consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe’s energy goals.",
            "In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament’s recent approval of the Government’s nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France’s ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country’s electricity mix.",
            "The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH’s BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.",
            "Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.",
            "“We’re seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates’ TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,” says Kotak.",
            "Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: “Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market.” She adds: “The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources – nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal – need to be considered.”",
            "The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.",
            "“From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn’t taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,” says Kotak.",
            "Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: “Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals.” As Kotak concludes: “As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we’ve seen with other energy sources.”"

            "Kozloduy NPP subsidiary, Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild (KZNPP-NM – Kozloduy NPP Novi Mostnosti) has announced that five companies have expressed interest in building units 7&8 at Bulgaria’s Kozloduy NPP under an EPC (engineering, procurement & construction) contract. KZNPP-NM invited expressions of interest in January with applications to be submitted by 2 February.",
            "While the units are to have Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, US-based Westinghouse will not take part in the construction but will retain overall control of the project. Applicants were required to demonstrate construction experience and commissioning of at least two nuclear units, to have solid experience in nuclear and turbine island of at least two units or have supplied and installed equipment for two units within the last 15 years. Applicants were also expected to demonstrate at least $6bn in turnover and profit for five years from 2018 to 2022.",
            "Deputy Energy Minister Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's official BTA news agency in December that the aim was to achieve a price of about €6bn ($6.5bn) for each of the units. For comparison, in 2014, when an earlier agreement was signed for the construction of Kozloduy 5 using AP-1000 technology, its price was estimated at $7.7bn.",
            "The Ministry of Energy did not reveal the names of the companies. However, at the end of January, KZNPP Director Valentin Nikolov told reporters that unofficial interest had been expressed by US Bechtel, which is already working with Westinghouse projects in Poland and the Czech Republic, and South Korea’s Hyundai, another Westinghouse partner. Other potential candidates included China National Nuclear Corporation, Électricité de France (EDF) and US-based Fluor, the parent company of small modular reactor company NuScale.",
            "Nikolov told a nuclear conference in Sofia that a financing option is being considered based on 30% as equity capital and 70% as attracted capital. Preliminary talks with banks have already been held, he noted, but the details will become clear at a later stage. In December, the Bulgarian parliament approved a government proposal to inject up to BGN1.5bn ($834.7m) into Kozloduy NPP for the construction of the two new reactors. According to Nikolov, between 5,000 and 10,000 people are expected to be directly involved in the construction of the two units and supporting activities.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades.",
            "In January 2023, the Bulgarian Parliament by a majority vote decided on the need to build two new reactors (units 7&8) using AP1000 technology and obliged the government to negotiate with the US government on this issue. In March KZNPP-NM and Westinghouse set up a joint working group to plan deployment of the AP1000 reactor in Bulgaria. In June, Westinghouse signed a Front-End Engineering & Design (FEED) contract with KZNPP-NM for a AP1000 reactor to be constructed at the Kozloduy NPP site.",
            "According to the parliamentary schedule for construction of the new units, the construction company must be selected by 30 April 2024 and will then join a consortium with Westinghouse. The participants in the construction consortium will share responsibilities for the design, construction of the equipment, delivery and installation, but a Bulgarian design company will control implementation at the consortium level. The activities for construction and installation, commissioning and start-up of the new reactors will be fixed in a separate document, which, however, will be part of the general contract between KZNPP-NM and the consortium.",

        "title": "Prodigy and Westinghouse to develop floating NPP",
        "text": [
            "Canadian firm Prodigy Clean Energy and US-based Westinghouse are designing a transportable NPP (TNPP) featuring a Westinghouse eVinci microreactor with the aim of launching the first project in Canada by 2030. The TNPP will comprise 5 MWe eVinci microreactors installed on a floating Prodigy Microreactor Power Station. According to a Westinghouse blog, the TNPP would be pre-fabricated and transported to site to supply power and heat to “remote industrial sites, data centres, communities, defence installations, and to islands and island nations”.",
            "To date, the only operational purpose-built floating NPP is Rosatom’s 70 MWe/58 MWt Akademik Lomonosov moored at Pevek in Chukotka in the Russian Arctic Russia’s Far East, which began supplying heat and power to the region in May 2020. Rosatom is in the process of building several morefor Artic industrial sites.",
            "According to Westinghouse, “The IAEA defines a TNPP as ‘a factory manufactured, movable nuclear power plant… capable of producing final energy products such as electricity and heat’.” it said. “This includes ‘Floating Nuclear Power Plants’ that are docked close to where the energy is needed, reducing the need for building the permanent infrastructure.”",
            "Prodigy’s design is for a shipyard-fabricated vessel that would be outfitted and transported by a dedicated heavy-lift carrier to its mooring. “But then the deployment itself would have specific infrastructure in place to hold and house the vessel in a safe place,” Prodigy Clean Energy President & CEO Mathias Trojer explained during a November 2023 panel at the IAEA’s first symposium on FNPPs. This is in effect a replica of the Akademik Lomonosov project.",
            "Trojan added: “We are merging proven technologies in nuclear engineering and nuclear civil construction with decades of experience in marine manufacturing, [operations and maintenance (O&M), lifecycle management of vessels, and integrating these with well-established approaches to nuclear and heavy equipment transport.” He said: “By selecting SMRs with proven safety and operability features at an adequate level of technology readiness, and capitalizing on best practices across these three industries, Prodigy will deliver FNPPs that are safe, robust, economical, but most importantly, licensable under current frameworks and ready for near-term implementation.” However, as yet, the eVinci technology is not proven and still in the design stage,",
            "Prodigy is developing two TNPP projects – the Microreactor Power Station, which can be marine or land-based, and a Grid-Scale Station, which would be installed at a shoreline within a protected harbour. Prodigy earlier signed a memorandum of understanding with NuScale Power for a grid-scale marine TNPP with up to 12 NuScale modules (for a combined output of 924-MWe). The companies completed conceptual design and economic assessments for the potential project in 2021 but it remains to be seen how this will be affected by the recent cancellation of NuScale’s project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) to construction of six SMRs at the US Department of Energy's (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL).",
            "The eVinci microreactor is a transportable reactor that is fully factory built, fuelled and assembled, and capable of delivering combined heat (up to 13 MWt) and power (up to 5 MWe). Its small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment, with superior reliability and minimal maintenance, making it suitable for use in remote locations. It will use TRISO fuel. It is one of several advanced reactor designs being supported through ARDP to help accelerate the development and deployment of new reactor technologies.",
            "Westinghouse said work toward a potential TNPP design for the eVinci, has progressed relatively quickly. “A multinational corporation operating strategic critical minerals assets in Canada funded a study in 2019-2020 to identify more reliable clean energy sources. In the study, Prodigy assessed the eVinci microreactor for deployment in a marine facility fixed at shoreside to power a remote mine.”",
            "In 2022, Westinghouse and Prodigy signed an agreement to further a potential TNPP design customised for eVinci. To date, supported by an award from Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund, the companies have completed “milestones” for conceptual engineering and regulatory studies. Westinghouse said the next steps include “completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project in Canada by 2030”.",
            "Addressing the IAEA panel in November, Trojer acknowledged that several challenges lie ahead for the widespread deployment of FNPPs. “Executing the development and deployment of an FNPP is a very complex exercise that needs to be carefully planned and systematically carried out,” he said. While the Akademik Lomonosov “is a highly successful proof of concept” as the industry sets out to “pioneer a new paradigm, there are significant questions that must be answered around the design, replicability, standardisation, the regulations, and more generally, the legal framework”.",

        "text": [
            "The International Energy Agency (IEA) in its latest report, Electricity 2024, dedicates a significant amount of space to nuclear power – a departure from its previous studies which treated it as peripheral. In its press release on the new report, IEA says the increase in electricity generation from renewables and nuclear \"appears to be pushing the power sector's emissions into structural decline\". Over the next three years, low-emissions generation is set to rise at twice the annual growth rate between 2018 and 2023. Global emissions from electricity generation are expected to decrease by 2.4% in 2024, followed by smaller declines in 2025 and 2026.",
            "According to IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol the power sector currently produces more CO2 emissions than any other in the world economy, “so it's encouraging that the rapid growth of renewables and a steady expansion of nuclear power are together on course to match all the increase in global electricity demand over the next three years”. He added: “This is largely thanks to the huge momentum behind renewables, with ever cheaper solar leading the way, and support from the important comeback of nuclear power, whose generation is set to reach a historic high by 2025.”",
            "The 170-page report generally includes nuclear alongside other renewables as a key factor in electricity demand, supply and CO2 emissions up to 2026. Nuclear is mentioned 227 times in the report including a dedicated 10-page ”spotlight” on nuclear power generation.",
            "Clean electricity supply is forecast to meet all of the world’s demand growth to 2026. “Record-breaking electricity generation from low-emissions sources – which includes nuclear and renewables such as solar, wind and hydro – is set to cover all global demand growth over the next three years…. The rapid growth of renewables, supported by rising nuclear generation, is set to displace global coal-fired generation, which is forecast to fall by an average of 1.7% annually through 2026,” the report notes.",
            "“By 2025, global nuclear generation is forecast to exceed its previous record set in 2021. Even as some countries phase out nuclear power or retire plants early, nuclear generation is forecast to grow by close to 3% per year on average through 2026 as maintenance works are completed within France, Japan restarts nuclear production at several power plants, and new reactors begin commercial operations in various markets, including China, India, Korea, and Europe, it notes.",
            "The overview, however, is somewhat distorted by the omission of Russia, which has one of the most ambitious nuclear expansion programmes in the world with several new units due to come on line in the next few years. By 2035, Russia plans to build 17 new large power units aiming to increase the share of nuclear generation in the overall energy balance from 20% to 25% by the 2040s. While the IEA report includes reference to Russian reactors being built abroad, it ignores its domestic development.",
            "The report’s nuclear “spotlight”, says that between 2024 and 2026, an additional 29 GW of new nuclear capacity is expected to come online globally, more than half of them in China and India. “With new plants starting commercial operation in various regions, as well as French nuclear recovery and expected restarts in Japan, we forecast global nuclear generation will be almost 10% higher in 2026 compared to 2023. In 2025, global electricity generation from nuclear energy will have exceeded its previous record level in 2021.”",
            "IEA notes that, “with a minority of European countries currently planning to phase out nuclear energy, many emerging and a number of advanced economies are planning to phase in or expand nuclear energy generation”. Based on the number of NPPs currently under construction and new ones being planned, “the growth in nuclear power is so far mainly in Asia”.",
            "Citing World Nuclear Association estimates. IEA says that, as of November 2023, 68 GW was under construction, with a further 109 GW currently planned and 353 GW proposed. “Based on reactors under construction with expected completion up until 2026, Asia is set to surpass North America as the region with the largest installed capacity.” China continues to lead in global nuclear capacity additions, with 27 GW currently under construction.",
            "IEA says technological leadership in nuclear power “is shifting towards China and Russia” noting that “technology providers for 70% of the reactors currently under construction were China and Russia”. The report also mentions India’s plans to triple its nuclear capacity by 2032, “which corresponds to capacity additions of almost 13 GW, with 6 GW currently under construction”.",
            "In Europe, “the political landscape for the deployment of nuclear power is evolving” despite phase out policies in Germany and Spain. Led by France, 14 European Union member states have joined an alliance to co-operate on nuclear energy. The goal of the alliance is to add 50 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, which means a 50% increase of installed nuclear capacity in the EU. In addition France plans to construct six new European Pressurised Reactors (EPR). with plans for a further eight reactors after 2026. There are also plans for nuclear development, by newbuild or life extension, in the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Finland, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Poland and Ukraine.",
            "In the USA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is considering lifetime extensions for operating reactors from 60 to 80 years. Around 6 GW of capacity extensions have already been approved, with another 10 GW under review or expected. However, 21 GW of nuclear capacity (23%) is expected to suspend operations between 2030 and 2040. “The replacement of this capacity will be a major challenge for the US nuclear sector,” IEA notes.",
            "“In Canada, 1.2 GW of capacity is planned to come online by 2036 at the Darlington site. In addition, the province of Ontario has announced plans to start predevelopment for the addition of 4.8 GW of capacity. A major construction project in South America is ongoing in Brazil, where the extension of the ANGRA site is delayed by almost four years, now scheduled for 2027 after initial plans for commercial readiness by 2023. Argentina plans to add a reactor to its Atucha site in co-operation with China.”",
            "IEA says construction risk of nuclear projects remains the largest hurdle for financing. “Globally, nuclear construction projects that started between 2010 and 2020 had an average delay of around three years, which amounted to an additional 50% increase on top of the initially planned construction time. China had an average delay of just over two years, while the global average, excluding Chinese projects, is three and a half years, with some projects up to eight years behind schedule.” It adds that “delays in Europe and the United States exceed what is observed in other parts of the world, with China especially posting significantly fewer delays”. Through cutting construction times and delays, and with the extensive experience of the construction of multiple plants in recent years, China is able to build NPPs at significantly lower cost and with minimal delays compared with the US and EU.",
            "Reducing construction risk can significantly bring down the cost of capital – a major cost factor for nuclear projects, the report says. “Complete and comprehensive design and planning should be completed before any construction begins. Further, high standards for documentation as well as integrated planning of interconnected dependencies are essential. Structural factors, such as supply-chain disruptions and skilled labour shortages need to be considered.”",
            "In addition to reducing construction risk, improving financing conditions will be important for the deployment of nuclear capacities. “In the case of incomplete financial markets, government interventions such as contracts for difference (CFDs), guarantees or market design measures can be economically justified. However, the risk of over-subsidising nuclear energy through these government-backed instruments can also be a concern.” Projects can be directly funded through state financing as in China and India and governments “can also step in as guarantors to bring down capital cost” In addition, state actors interested in selling technology can also provide vendor financing, “as done by Russia for the construction of Rooppur nuclear reactor in Bangladesh or the El-Dabaa plant in Egypt”.",
            "Typical measures include buil-own-operate as for the Akkuyu NPP being built by Russia in Türkiye or CFDs agreements as agreed on for the new Hinkley Point C reactor in the UK. “Dedicated institutions with focused expertise and pooled capital can also be beneficial. Within this context, the International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure (IBNI) intends to provide a wide range of financial and advisory services for the development of nuclear projects in its member states. According to its representatives, they expect 20-30 countries to sign the joint declaration for the establishment of the institution between December 2023 and the Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels in March 2024.” However, IEA points out that more than half of the world’s major private banks have excluded nuclear energy from their green financing frameworks.",
            "The report also looks at small modular reactors (SMRs) noting that the smaller project size and possible serial production helps to facilitate the financing of projects. While there are a range of technologies with different use-cases being developed “currently, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), there are only two countries operating SMRs, China and Russia”.",
            "Referring to the discontinuation of the NuScale SMR project set to deploy the first VOYGR SMR in Idaho (US) in 2023, IEA says the outcome and influence on the financial viability of NuScale remains unclear. “This event underlined the difficulties and vulnerabilities of pilot SMR projects, raising concerns about the future of them.”"

KSU, which trains operators and maintenance personnel for Swedish NPPs, will support Fermi Energia in conducting courses and utilising simulator technologies and other training tools during the preparations for deploying and SMR plant in Estonia.",
            "KSU will be a long-term training partner for Fermi Energia to ensure the future safe operation and maintenance of the NPP through professional training of future plant employees. The protocol of common intentions sets out mutual interests in the development of competences in the nuclear energy sector, focusing on the development of training and qualification schemes, programmes, personnel qualification systems, skills testing and the implementation of training programmes.",
            "\"Fermi Energia has been cooperating with KSU for three years,” said Fermi Energia management board member Henri Ormus. “They have provided valuable seminars and training on nuclear energy and introduced nuclear energy as part of practical visits to Swedish nuclear plants. KSU is GE Hitachi's partner in developing the BWRX-300 reactor training programme, so we see KSU as a long-term partner in creating, developing and training the operators and other personnel of the Estonian nuclear power plant.” KSU’s agreement with GE Hitachi was concluded in January 2023 and the following month, Fermi Energia chosen GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 SMR for deployment in Estonia by the early 2030s.",
            "Fermi Energia was founded by Estonian energy and nuclear energy professionals specifically to develop deployment of SMRs in Estonia. In July 2019, the company launched a feasibility study on the suitability of SMRs for Estonia's electricity supply and climate goals beyond 2030. This followed a financing round from investors and shareholders. At that time, four SMR designs were included in the feasibility study: Moltex Energy SSR-W300, Terrestrial Energy IMSR-400, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 and NuScale Power’s SMR.",
            "In 2022, before selecting the BWRX-300, Fermi Energia had also considered tenders from NuScale and the UK’s Rolls-Royce. Fermi Energia said the criteria for selection were technological maturity, establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "The BWRX-300 design is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is the 10th evolution of GE’s boiling water reactor (BWR), hence the “X” in its name. The design is based on the Generation III+ 1,520MWe ESBWR, which the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified in 2014. The BWRX-300 is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Pre-licensing Vendor Design Review and a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Pre-application design review.",

            "Until November, NuScale appeared to be leading the field to deploy the first small modular reactor (SMR) in the USA. Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and NuScale Power had agreed to construction of six small modular reactors (SMRs) at the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as part of the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP). However, the project was cancelled. “Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough subscription to continue toward deployment,” a joint statement said.",

This compared to revenue of $3.2 m and a net loss of $49.6m for the same period in 2022 , meanwhile cash, equivalents and short-term investments had stood at $252m at the the end of Q1.",
            "On a call with analysts in November, Ramsey Hamady, NuScale’s chief financial officer, said the firm expected to “take in about $50m worth of cash from customers from work that we do.” However, the company spent more than that in the previous three-month cycle, HuffPost noted. “This isn’t just a fixed-expense business. There’s variable expense, and there’s a lot of discretionary spending,” the paper cited Hamady as saying. “We spend more as we have contracts, and we pull in our spending as contracts either get pushed out or delayed or whether we want to focus more on discretionary spend or nondiscretionary spend.”",

            "The final report pf Estonia’s Working Group on Nuclear Energy has concluded that the introduction of nuclear energy would support the achievement of climate objectives, security of supply and stability of the energy system.",
            "Over the past two and a half years the National Nuclear Energy Working Group analysed the potential of small modular reactors (SMRs) in line with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Milestones Approach for the development of national nuclear infrastructure, which lists 19 important steps for the introduction of nuclear energy.",
            "The 164-page report – Opportunities for the Deployment of Nuclear Energy in Estonia (Tuumaenergia Kasutuselevotmise Voimalused Eestis) said nuclear energy would provide additional support to renewable energy. The Working Party considers that, provided there is timely planning, adequate funding, political and public support, the introduction of nuclear energy in Estonia will be achieved.",
            "According to Antti Tooming, Undersecretary of the Nuclear Energy Working Group, Undersecretary-General of the Ministry of Climate, nuclear energy has proven itself in many countries around the world. “Other energy has the potential to ensure a stable energy supply in Estonia for future generations.” He added that interest in the introduction of nuclear energy, especially SMRs, is currently experiencing major growth around the world. He emphasised that any country that decides in favour of nuclear energy, must not undermine the expansion of renewable energy or delay emission reduction policies. The report notes: “In conclusion, it is important to ensure that the introduction of nuclear energy does not undermine the increase in renewable energy production and storage capacities and does not lead to a delay in reducing emissions.”",
            "The deployment of nuclear energy can make a significant contribution to achieving Estonia's climate goals, ensuring security of supply and stability of the energy system, without limiting the development of renewable energy.",
            "Introducing nuclear energy into a country without previous experience requires years of preparation and the start of power generation from a nuclear power plant would take 9-11 years, the report noted. It will require preparation of a legal framework, the development of competences and site selection as the next steps.",
            "A new public authority must be set up to regulate the safety of nuclear energy, employing a total of about 80 people during operation of the plant. In addition to the existing staff of the Climate & Radiation Department of the Environment Agency, which will be merged into the new body, more than 60 new staff, including 20 specialists in the field of nuclear energy, should be hired, some from abroad for at least the first years.",
            "Assuming NPP construction is financed by the private sector and that the role of the state is to establish a framework for nuclear energy use, from implementation of the nuclear programme to the start of electricity production a total of €73m ($79m) would be needed for the 9-11 year period. A further €54m would be needed over 10 years to support the necessary emergency services and facilities required for nuclear plants.",
            "The report said the introduction of nuclear energy would generate additional revenue in the form of higher tax revenues and the revitalisation of economic activity. This would exceed the cost of establishing and maintaining a national framework during in the plant construction phase. SMRs with a capacity of less than 400 MWe would be suitable in Estonia and the choice of technology should be based on follow experience and fuel supply.",
            "“Although the nuclear power plant plans take into account up to 1200 MW or up to four reactors, the small size of the Baltic Electricity Market, National Renewable Energy and security of supply targets and European carbon-free in view of the likely development of the market for hydrogen products, three or four are envisaged…[if] the reactor is being built on the hydrogen products market instead of electricity generation.”",
            "In the first months of 2024, the Government and Council of the Republic will discuss the possible launch of a nuclear programme. Estonia plans to phase out domestic oil shale by 2035. A draft report by the working group issued in 2022 estimated Estonia could get its first nuclear power plant by 2035. “The long-term sustainability of Estonian oil shale power plants (2035+ view) is declining, as a large part of the plants are old and have less and less competitiveness in the electricity market due to high carbon emissions,” the report notes. “To a certain extent, gas stations are certainly supporting the Estonian electricity system and necessary for Estonia, primarily for providing fast frequency reserves. However, if we talk about covering the base load on a large scale, then a nuclear power plant is potentially the most advantageous solution in terms of electricity price.”",
            "In February 2023, Estonia's privately held nuclear energy company, Fermi Energia, selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 SMR) for deployment in Estonia by the early 2030s. In 2022 Fermi Energia had accepted tenders from US-Japan joint venture GE Hitachi, US-based NuScale and the UK’s Rolls-Royce. Fermi Energia said the criteria for selection were technological maturity, establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness, and participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "In April 2023, four potential locations across Estonia, which could accommodate a NPP were identified by a Finance Ministry analysis. The four locations are at Toila, Ida-Viru County, Kunda, Lääne-Viru County, Loksa, Harju County and Varbla, Pärnu County. The analysis was in effect a feasibility study on whether a nuclear plant would be viable anywhere in Estonia, with the conclusion being that it would be. The analysis was conducted by infrastructure consultancy firm Skepast & Puhkim, whose representative, Triin Lepland, told a press conference that any site selection would take place in stages.",

            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report:",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets’",
            "which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector's progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia's",
            ", the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale's pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance. It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale's VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium developing by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector's early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

            "Six small modular reactor (SMR) designs have been selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK – are those considered most able to deliver operating reactors by the mid-2030s and support the UK’s ambitions to reach 24 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Gwen Parry-Jones, CEO of Great British Nuclear, explained: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029.”",
            "The SMR competition is part of a plan for the UK to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy. A nuclear power revival is a central plank of that strategy and the companies through to the next stage will be invited to bid for government contracts later this year. The winning bidders are expected to be announced in spring next year and contracts are due to be awarded in the summer. Announcing the initial tranche of winning entrants, UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: “Small Modular Reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.”",
            "EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited are the companies that have been chosen for the next stage of the process. Key design details and developments are outlined below:",
            "EDF’s NUWARDTM is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor with an integrated primary loop producing 340 MWe from two independent reactors rated at 170 MWe each or 540 MWth. The two units will be housed in a single building and will share common equipment where possible.",
            "According to EDF, the design is focused on standardisation, modular manufacturing and simplicity for in-factory mass production, and flexibility in the construction and operation phases. Furthermore, the design has been developed to support load following and adapted for non-electric uses. With a design availability of around 90%, the fuel cycle is two years and the service life is 60 years. The core features 76 fuel assemblies.",
            "In March this year, EDF created the NUWARD subsidiary in line with its objective to achieve first nuclear concrete in 2030 for its reference SMR plant in France. After finalising the conceptual design, NUWARD is now shifting to the basic design phase.",
            "The NUWARD subsidiary will continue to work with historic partners CEA, TechnicAtome, Naval Group as well as new partners Framatome and Tractebel who were onboarded last year. Tractebel will be responsible for the civil engineering preliminary studies and the evaluation of costs, for example.",
            "Earlier this year EDF submitted the NUWARD design to France’s Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority), marking the start of the pre-licensing process while in June 2022, EDF announced that the design would be the case study for a European early joint regulatory review led by ASN with participation from Finland’s Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB).",
            "Renaud Crassous, NUWARD’s President said: “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the NUWARDTM SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030”.",
            "According to EDF’s SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years.",
            "GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR generating 870 MWth that is based on a larger BWR that is already licensed and operating. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is a Generation III+ reactor certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. The SMR version, the BWRX-300, uses natural circulation and passive cooling isolation condenser systems as well as fully passive safety systems. It’s fuel enrichment, averaging 3.81% and with a 4.95% maximum, puts it firmly in the realms of conventional commercially available fuels and it has a design refueling cycle of 12-24 months as well as a 60-year operational design life.",
            "The construction technologies incorporated into the design adopt advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques that have been proven in the oil and gas, tunneling and power industries. As a result of this approach and using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, GE Hitachi suggests the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in as little as 24-36 months while also achieving an approximate 90% volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW it should also account for around half the amount of concrete. As with other SMR designs, the BWRX-300 claims a cost-competitive approach that can be deployed for both electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating.",
            "An advanced reactor, GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 sets itself apart from other SMR designs with its proven, less complicated attributes and anticipates the design will be deployable globally as early as 2029 thanks to proven know-how and innovative construction techniques. Launched in 2017, the SMR is the 10th evolution of the BWR light water reactor design from GE.",
            "The design has achieved some notable success. This year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to explore the construction of multiple advanced nuclear reactors including proposals for a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site, starting with a plant design and an NRC license application with a view to potentially getting an operational SMR at the site around 2032. Meanwhile, last year Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) selected the BWRX-300 for single-unit project that was initially anticipated to begin operating as early as 2028.",

The design, which has been in development since 2010, features a reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components that are located underground, as well as a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down or dissipate decay heat. A key part of the SMR-160 roll-out as envisioned by Holtec is to deploy the reactor as a replacement for the boilers found in coal-fired power stations and reusing the majority of the existing assets. The use of multi-stage compressors that are capable of uprating SMR-160’s steam (700 psi @ 595 Deg F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant are a critical part of this plan. Furthermore, the ability of the SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure also opens new development opportunities, such as using high-pressure steam for industrial applications.",
            "Having been shortlisted, the aim is to start construction of the first UK SMR-160 unit as early as 2028 and Holtec intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s in serial production by 2050 across the UK, amounting to 5.1 GW.",
            "This year South Korean national financial institutions K-Sure (Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) and Kexim (Export-Import Bank of Korea) signed agreements with Holtec and Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to provide financial support for SMR-160 projects around the world.",
            "Holtec has a collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C from late 2021 that will see Hyundai perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction. The reactor will be initially manufactured at Holtec’s Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus in Camden, New Jersey.",
            "The SMR-160 design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "More recently, Ukraine’s nuclear generating company Energoatom signed a cooperation agreement that envisions implementation of an SMR-160 pilot project with targeted grid connection by March 2029. The deal further contemplates up to 20 additional SMR-160 units in Ukraine and a manufacturing facility.",
            "The NuScale SMR is a PWR dubbed the NuScale Power Module. This a small PWR is designed to generate 77 MWe at 250 MWth and with be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGRTM SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. It will use standard light water reactor fuel and is the only small modular reactor to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As with other SMR designs, the NuScale Power Module was developed to supply electricity but also potentially generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications. The design features passive operating and safety systems and the modules are submerged in a pool built below ground level.",
            "NuScale SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries and the first project is expected to begin operation in 2029 in Idaho. NuScale has already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components and, in May, South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility began producing forgings for the first VOYGR-6 power plant to be built for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "Earlier this year Polish metals company KGHM Polska MiedzKGHM received preliminary state approval for a planned SMR which followed on from a 2022 agreement with NuScale to work on deploying a VOYGR plant in Poland by 2029.",
            "A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed this year by Romanian nuclear utility SNN, NuScale, Romanian companies E-INFRA and Nova Power & Gas, US-based Fluor Enterprises and South Korea’s Samsung C&T Corporation to collaborate on the deployment of VOYGR plants in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania aims to be the first country in Europe to deploy a VOYGR SMR and earlier this month Romania’s National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities approved the Licensing Basis Document for the NuScale design.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWth. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK where it has completed the first phase and is expected to complete the second step by July 2024.",
            "Commenting on the shortlisting, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce SMR CEO, said: “We have the only SMR technology in a European regulatory approval process, putting us almost two years ahead of any of our competitors. Securing a domestic contract is vitally important to unlock the enormous global export potential of our clean energy technology.”",
            "This year Rolls-Royce SMR and Sumitomo Corporation completed a joint feasibility study which shows the reactor could offer a significant advantage for the production of low-carbon hydrogen when cost, availability and carbon emissions are taken into consideration.",
            "The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finnish power company Fortum to explore opportunities for the deployment of SMRs in Finland and Sweden. Last year Fortum began a two-year feasibility study to explore necessary conditions for deployment of SMRs.",
            "A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs and expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s. Rolls-Royce is also discussing deployment of its SMR with the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and the Netherlands.",
            "The Westinghouse AP300TM small modular reactor is currently the only SMR based on a licensed, operating nuclear reactor design. Launched in May this year, the design is derived from the operating AP1000 PWR which makes it unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks. It is an advanced, Generation III+ single-loop pressurised light water reactor.",
            "It utilises the same engineering, components and supply chain as the AP1000 which Westinghouse says will thus enable streamlined licensing and leveraging of available technical skills. The company adds that the advantageous economics of the AP300 are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development. Four AP1000 units are operating in China with a further six under construction and one is operating at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, USA, while a second is nearing completion there. The simplified, modular, ultra-compact nuclear island also reduces construction costs and schedule, Westinghouse says. For these reasons the company argues that it is confident that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "The AP300 SMR features advanced passive safety systems designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown condition without operator action, back-up power or pumps and has an output of 300 MWe from 990 MWth.",
            "Commenting, Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO said: “We look forward to this opportunity to demonstrate that the AP300 SMR is the best option for the UK.”",
            "Earlier this year Westinghouse Electric Company and Finland’s Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the possibilities for the development and deployment of AP300 reactor projects in Finland and Sweden. This deal was followed by a similar MoU agreement with Slovak state-owned nuclear company JAVYS and another with Ukraine’s Energoatom.",
            "The successful development of SMRs could completely transform how nuclear power stations are built and result in billions of pounds of investment in the UK and elsewhere. The flexibility of design means that SMRs could also play a significant role is decarbonising hard-to-reach sectors like chemicals, building materials and other energy-intensive industries. Although six companies’ designs have been shortlisted for the next phase of the UK competition, much will depend on a successful roll out of the winning designs, not just in the UK but much further afield too. SMRs clearly offer much promise but the success of SMRs will also mark a key breakthrough for nuclear technology more broadly."

            "Poland's Climate & Environment Ministry issued decisions-in-principle for the construction at six locations of BWRX-300 small modular reactors (SMRs). A total of 24 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactors are planned for the sites.",
            "Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) in April shortlisted seven locations in Poland for further geological surveys to host SMR plants based on GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300, for which it holds the exclusive right in Poland. The locations were: Ostrołęka, Włocławek, Stawy Monowskie, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Nowa Huta, Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone and Warsaw.",
            "OSGE then submitted applications to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for decisions-in-principle on the construction of SMRs all those locations except Warsaw.",
            "The Ministry’s decisions-in-principle for the six locations is the first step in the process of administrative permits for investments in nuclear power facilities in Poland. This entitles OSGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "Rafał Kasprów, President of OSGE’s Management Board announced the decisions during the Net Zero Nuclear forum at the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai. \"The decisions enable us to launch a programme to build a fleet of BWRX-300 reactors in Poland to provide zero-emission, stable energy sources for the energy, industry and heating sectors,\" he said.",
            "GE Hitachi, BWXT Canada and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) in December 2021, signed a Letter of Intent to cooperate in deploying BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland. OSGE – a joint venture between chemical producers SGE and PKN Orlen applied to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency in July 2022 for the assessment of the reactor design.",
            "However, the Climate Ministry’s positive decision has been thrown into doubt after the Internal Security Agency (ABW – Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) issued a negative opinion on the plans, according to Polish media. Polityka weekly reported that the ABW noted that the Climate Ministry is required to obtain the ABW’s opinion as part of its assessment of the nuclear project.",
            "While ABW’s opinion is not binding, a negative assessment makes it unlikely the Ministry would approve the SMR plans, according to industry news service Energetyka24. OSGE confirmed that the ABW had issued a negative opinion but issued a statement strongly objecting to the agency’s assessment. OSGE accused ABW of being “incompetent and irresponsible” in the context of Poland’s increasingly urgent need for an energy transition away from coal. It also called for the agency’s reasoning for its decision to be declassified.",
            "“In the course of more than 230 days of proceedings, the ABW did not once meet with either the applicant, OSGE, the technology supplier, US-based GE-Hitachi, or see the data on the proposed locations,” company said in a statement. “We do not know on what basis ABW issued its opinions.” OSGE said its requests to declassify ABW’s reasons for its opinion had been rejected and that it would pursue the case further in court. “We are convinced that these are neither substantive nor professional reasons.”",
            "Business Insider said the negative ABW decision was known in the Ministry and to OSGE at least a month ago, both of which had appealed against it. Business Insider's unnamed source officials at the Ministry of Climate repudiated ABW’s opinion which reportedly concerned the technology itself. Pressed for are consideration of the decision, ABW issued a negative opinion for the second time, Business insider noted.",
            "Reporting on the dispute, TVN24 Business cited OSGE as saying:",
            "\"The world is moving towards both large and SMR nuclear technologies, as confirmed by the current COP28 global climate conference. To achieve the goals of decarbonising Polish energy, many state and private investments are needed.” The company insisted that it had been \"transparently\" conducting the process of implementing technology from the beginning. ABW had provided \" neither substantive nor professional reasons\". OSGE added “will continue its licensing, environmental and location activities related to the construction of the BWRX-300 fleet for the needs of Polish industry, heating and energy\".",
            "TVN24 also received a statement from ABW, which said, as a public authority it “acts only on the basis and within the limits of law”. Minister and Coordinator of Special Services Mariusz Kamiński defended the ABW decision accusing OSGE of “manipulations and lies”. He added: “Before issuing an opinion, the Agency conducts a multi-element opinion procedure aimed at assessing the impact of the indicated investment on the internal security of the state.\" With respect to the application submitted by OSGE, “it should be noted that in the opinion of ABW, the investment carried out by the company unduly protects the interests of the Treasury, including Orlen”. He insisted that the activities of ABW were aimed at \"soundly safeguarding the interests of the Republic of Poland, and were conducted in accordance with the regulations and maintaining the highest standards\".",
            "These developments come amid uncertainty about what is going to be the next government's stance on nuclear energy, following elections in October. Opposition leader Donald Tusk is hoping to lead a coalition government of three opposition groups. His statements indicate that he is in favour of large-scale nuclear. “Nuclear power plants are essential. We are out of time,” he said in November. However, according to PAP, his view on SMRs is less clear. Commenting on the OSGE-ABW dispute he noted that “this civil war” between state institutions “on such an important issue must raise concern”. He criticised Orlen and the government for ignoring the ABW’s concerns and pushing ahead with the plans.",

        "text": [
            "A recent statement from Fitch Ratings casts doubt on any new nuclear construction in the US in the immediate future. Similar concerns were voiced during discussions at a full committee hearing of the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources to Examine Opportunities and Challenges Associated with Advanced Nuclear Reactor Commercialisation.",
            "Fitch noted that without “broader joint action, improved cost competitiveness and/or greater certainty of cost and delivery, most US public power systems are unlikely to pursue new nuclear construction over the next few years, and those that do face the risk of weakened credit quality”.",
            "The recent announcement by the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and NuScale Power to terminate their Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) illustrates the challenges facing public power systems as they consider new nuclear construction, Fitch said. “The project was unable to attract interest from enough purchasers to continue development, despite the plant's modular design, improved safety measures and the offer of low-cost government funding, likely due to schedule delays and cost concerns.”",
            "Interest in new nuclear generation “should remain piqued as a result of proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants, as well as widening concerns about the effects of climate change and more aggressive carbon-free energy standards”. However, “until the cost of new construction can be assured through insurance or guarantees provided by the US government or highly creditworthy entities, widespread ownership agreements can broadly distribute and limit project exposure, and new design construction is proven to be both feasible and replicable, these risks will remain formidable barriers to participation”.",
            "Fitch noted that nuclear projects “are large, costly and complex, and developers have a historically poor record of completing new projects on time and within budget”. The agency cited the projects launched at the Summer and Vogtle nuclear stations in 2013 that were “plagued by scheduling delays, fabrication challenges, labour shortages and significant cost overruns almost from the beginning of construction”. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) completed its Watts Bar unit 2 in 2016 after work was suspended in 1985 and resumed in 2007, Fitch said. “However, the final cost was roughly $2bn higher than initially planned.” It was only the operational breadth and financial strength of TVA allowed that the utility to absorb the costs and maintain its then current ratings.",
            "Meanwhile, the US Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee hearing chaired by Joe Manchin discussed opportunities for advanced nuclear considering federal support from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, commercialisation challenges and the need to onshore nuclear energy supply chains.",
            "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $2.4bn to support competitive Department of Energy (DOE) awards for advanced reactor demonstration projects at commercial scale. The IRA provided ten years of certainty to commercialise advanced reactors through a 30% investment tax credit or $25/MWh production tax credit for new nuclear plants, along with making tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees available for nuclear projects, said Chairman Manchin, opening the hearing. “The IRA incentives were not just about building power plants, but also securing our nuclear supply chain. Congress provided $700m for High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is the fuel that most advanced nuclear technologies need, including Pele, Terrapower, and X-Energy.”",
            "However, “despite all of the federal and private sector support, we’re witnessing struggles and hesitancy in getting advanced nuclear projects off the ground”, he said. There are large design, cost, and regulatory uncertainties associated with first-of-a-kind nuclear technology, he added, which is why numerous federal programmes were put in place to help reduce these risks. “But someone will need to go first, and unfortunately many of the utilities I’ve spoken with won’t get in the game until others have done it first. We also must continue to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent judiciously and we’re managing risks – and learning from instances like the NuScale project with UAMPS, which fell far short of our expectations.”",
            "Manchin also commented on the need to offset China and Russia’s growing influence on international nuclear energy development. “We must push back and they cannot succeed. To regain our civil nuclear leadership, we need to demonstrate domestically that we can develop and deploy the next generation of nuclear energy to attract our international partners. We also need to export these technologies to our allies and partners to help reduce their energy dependence on foreign adversaries.”",
            "He also discussed Russia’s dominance over the nuclear fuel supply chain. “Currently, Russia is the only commercial supplier of HALEU, the fuel used for our DOD [Defence Department] micro-reactor project, DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Projects, and many other advanced nuclear technologies.” The bipartisan Nuclear Fuel Security Act of 2023 “authorises a DOE programme to onshore US uranium conversion and enrichment capacity, for both traditional and advanced reactors”, said Manchin. “We must re-establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and our bill will do just that. I’ve also worked … to introduce legislation that would limit and eventually ban uranium fuel imports from Russia. Today, I’m calling on my Congressional colleagues to include these critical nuclear fuel bills and associated funding in the defence and appropriations packages we’re currently negotiating.”",
            "The committee heard witnesses from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) at the Office of the Secretary of Defence, Dow chemical company and the US Nuclear Industry Council.",
            "Dr John C Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL described the various projects underway. These included MARVEL, an 85 kW DOE test reactor; Pele, a partnership with DOD and BWXT that will utilise TRi-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel. INL, working with Southern Company and TerraPower also plans to conduct the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE), which “will become the world’s first fast spectrum salt reactor experiment to achieve criticality”. These first three systems will be authorised for operation under DOE authority, as opposed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing. The first planned NRC-licensed reactor on the INL site is the Oklo Aurora microreactor in 2027. INL intends to use existing reactor facilities as test beds for reactor demonstrations via the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) to streamline testing, demonstration, and, ultimately, deployment of advanced reactors into the market.",
            "“We are making steady progress, said Wagner. “But we cannot rest easy, as the recent ending of the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) Carbon Free Power Project shows. The era of constructing paper reactors must end. We have to identify our challenges, address, and overcome them. We need to accelerate the systems and build the supply chains needed to rapidly develop and deploy advanced technologies at scale, in our nation and around the world. The project did not end because of technical flaws [but] was suspended because of economics.”",
            "He added: “We cannot abdicate our world leadership in nuclear energy development and deployment. When we build new systems – and export our technologies, materials, and services – we also export our values. A nuclear power plant is designed to operate for six to eight decades. When a country sells a nuclear reactor to another nation, it begins what can be a century-long relationship that encompasses many areas.”",
            "Countries will look for developers who can quickly, safely, affordably, and effectively develop a reactor and get it deployed. “And because U.S. developers are not competing on equal terms, too many of these nations will turn to China, Russia or our friends in South Korea. This presents not just a missed opportunity, but in the case of Russian and Chinese expansion, a danger to US national security.” INL is also working to supply HALEU from DOE-owned materials. “But our lack of domestic fuel cycle capabilities is already hurting efforts to deploy the next generation of technologies needed to allow our commercial fleet to produce 24/7, carbon-free power more than 93% of the time,” Wagner noted.",
            "Optimistic presentations were made by Dr Jeff Waksman SCO Program Manager, about projects being developed by DOD and Edward Stones Vice President, Energy & Climate at Dow about its planned project with X-Energy. However, Jeffrey S Merrifield, a former Commissioner at NRC and Chairman of the Advanced Nuclear Working Group of the US Nuclear Industry Council was more circumspect",
            "He acknowledged that companies such as Dow, Microsoft, Google and Nucor were all considering how nuclear energy to meet their energy needs. These companies share is a large balance sheet and conduct extensive infrastructure design and construction. “Thus, they are not deterred by the additional complexity and patience that comes with the deployment of nuclear power.” However, apart from large state-owned or quasi state-owned utilities, including Ontario Power Generation in Canada and Tennessee Valley Authority other power utilities are hesitant.",
            "“Financial markets and public utility commissions have viewed what is admittedly a tortuous path that it took to get Southern Company’s Vogtle units 3-4 online and the failure of the VC Summer project and have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to repeat that example. Despite the provision of government-backed loan guarantees and other federal tax incentives that are intended to jump start the order process, utility executives … have a variety of built-in incentives for not jumping to the front of the line.",
            "What utilities fear the most is that they will commit to building a first-of-a-kind plant and that there will be financial and timing risk on the back end of the project that could put the utility at economic risk.”",
            "He proposed further support from the federal government and Congress , noting: “As a nation, our skills at building very large infrastructure projects, to put it politely, are ‘rusty’ and we need to have additional investment in university-based engineering programmes.” He added: “Some of the capabilities needed to build new nuclear units either don’t exist or have limited options in the US. While some of these come from friendly nuclear supplier countries such as South Korea and Japan, the vast potential for new nuclear deployment certainly begs the question as to why more of this supply of components can’t be fabricated and built in the US.”",
            "To achieve the economies of scale needed to efficiently and cost effectively manufacture multiple lines of small modular reactors (SMRs), further incentives will be necessary."

            "Poland's Ministry of Climate & Environment has issued a decision-in-principle for a second large NPP. Two South Korean-supplied APR1400 reactors are planned in the Patnów-Konin region of Wielkopolska province in central Poland. A positive decision by the Ministry of Culture & Higher Education makes it possible to start work at the site and confirms the compliance of the planned investment with the objectives of Poland's energy policy. According to the plan, the two reactors with a total installed capacity of 2,800 MWe will provide 22 TWh of energy annually, which corresponds to 12% of current electricity demand in Poland.",
            "The decision-in-principle is the first step in the process of administrative permits required for investments in nuclear power facilities in Poland. It entitles ZE PAK and PGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "PGE PAK Energia Jadrowa (PPEJ) submitted its application to the Ministry in June. PPEJ is a joint special purpose vehicle set up by Polish public company ZE PAK (Zespól Elektrowni Patnów-Adam-Konin) and Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) – both Treasury owned – to implement the project to construct the NPP in Patnów. The plant will comprise two reactors supplied by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). PPEJ was established just five months after the letter of intent was signed in Seoul in October 2022 between PGE, ZE PAK and KHNP. PGE and ZE PAK will each own 50% of the shares in PPEJ, which secures the interest of the Polish Treasury in the project.",
            "Jacek Sasin, Poland’s Minister of State Assets said energy security is the basis for the functioning of the state, and in view of the challenges related to energy transformation, only nuclear power can provide a stable basis in the coming years to ensure access to cheap and clean energy and support economic development. “The implementation of the project that PGE PAK Energia Nuclear wants to implement together with the Korean side in Pątnów fits perfectly into the plans that the government has in this respect,” he noted. “The issue of a fundamental decision for this draft confirms this. So I hope that the further implementation of this project will not stop or prevent anything.”",
            "Wojciech Dąbrowski, President of the PGE Management Board said the basic decision “is crucial for the construction of a nuclear power plant and allows us to move on to the next stages of the investment”. He added: “We received it less than 13 months after signing the letter of intent. In the case of such a large investment, this is a very good result. It is also proof of the commitment and good cooperation of all partners in the project and confirmation that the ambitious plan to launch the first unit by 2035 is very realistic. The power plant will provide consumers with cheap and clean energy, and Poland, along with renewable energy sources, with energy security and independence.”",
            "This project is developing in parallel with Poland’s official nuclear power programme. Poland has ambitious nuclear power development plans. In September 2021, it was announced that six large pressurised water reactors with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040 to reduce its reliance on coal. Construction of the first 1.0-1.6 GWe plant was expected to start in 2026 for commissioning in 2033. Subsequent units will be implemented every 2-3 years. In November 2022, the government announced the first plant, with a capacity of 3,750 MWe, would be built in Pomerania using US Westinghouse AP1000 technology. An agreement outlining a plan for delivery of the plant was signed in May by Westinghouse, Bechtel and state-owned Polish utility Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe (PEJ).",
            "In April, PEJ had applied to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for a similar decision for the Westinghouse project and in July the Ministry issued a fundamental decision approving the plan. It formally confirmed that investment in Poland’s first NPP is in the public interest and in line with state energy policy.",
            "PPEJ President Jakub Rybicki said in August that he expected the Patnów project to begin operation in 2035. “We are starting negotiations with our Korean partner regarding the feasibility study, agreements on financing our project and the creation of a Polish-Korean company that will directly lead this process,” he noted.",
            "However, currently KHNP is facing a lawsuit filed by Westinghouse in October 2022 alleging intellectual property infringement. Westinghouse insists that KHNP’s APR1400 nuclear reactor is based on Westinghouse technology. KHNP contests this. “After launching its own nuclear programme, Korea gradually built up technology, carrying out research and development projects with long-term plans for over 30 years.

            "The recent visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to Kazakhstan resulted in a raft of agreements covering a wide range of areas. Kazakhstan President Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev said the visit was of special importance in terms of determining the prospects for the development of relations between the two countries. He noted that the independent development of the two countries was not an obstacle but resulted in a mutually beneficial partnership” which was “well understood in both Kazakhstan and Russia”.",
            "During extensive negotiations between the high-level delegations from both sides key areas were identified for future cooperation and a number of agreements were reached aimed at strengthening cooperation in health, energy, transport, agriculture, sports and other areas. The two presidents reaffirmed that both sides were keen to strengthening multilateral relations and “to advance the integration process in the Eurasian space”.",
            "While nuclear energy was not part of the official talks, it was the subject of numerous interviews by officials from both sides. While Kazakhstan has firm plans to build its first NPP, has selected a site and is considering offers from a number of suppliers, these plans are temporarily on hold pending a national referendum on the issue. In September President Tokayev acknowledged that public opinion in Kazkahstan was divided on the nuclear issue. “Considering how much suffering the Semipalatinsk test site caused to our people, one can understand their suspicions. Therefore, we must continue public hearings, detailed, large-scale discussions on this issue,” he said. “We need to make a final decision on important strategic issues by referendum. This was my promise to the people before the elections in 2019. The question of whether or not to build a nuclear power plant is a very important question for the future of our country. Therefore, I believe that it should be resolved by a national referendum. We will determine the exact deadline later.”",
            "In the meantime, however, plans, discussions and lobbying continue. In the run up to his visit to Kazakhstan, President Putin gave a wide-ranging interview to Kazakhstanskaya Pravda newspaper, which was published on the Kremlin website. In response to a question on energy, Putin noted: “As you know, the leadership of the Republic of Kazakhstan is considering the issue of constructing a nuclear power plant on its territory. If the decision to implement this project is made, Rosatom state corporation is ready to develop a corresponding project using the most advanced technologies, in compliance with the highest environmental requirements and safety standards. This will increase the energy supply of the Kazakhstan economy and give a powerful impetus to the socio-economic development of the country.”",
            "The following day, Rosatom Director General Alexey Likhachev, in told Izvestia, that Rosatom intends to invest in uranium mining in Kazakhstan. He said: \"Kazakhstan is the top uranium producer – we will develop cooperation taking into consideration of interest of third countries, creating alliances, and investing in production in Kazakhstan.\" He also added that if Kazakhstan says \"yes\" to nuclear power, “Rosatom will be able to promptly implement the project of nuclear power plant construction in the country”. He added: “We will offer a reference solution that can be viewed in the Russian Federation and Belarus.” He emphasised that Kazakh partners had already had the opportunity to carefully study Rosatom’s experience in the construction of NPPs, having visited the its facilities, including the Akkuyu station in Turkey, as well as the Belarus NPP.",
            "The same day, Kazakhstan's Energy Minister, Almasadam Satkaliev noted that Kazakhstan is considering various proposals for the construction of a NPP. \"The Rosatom company is one of the vendors,” he said. “In addition to Rosatom, applications were submitted by the France’s EDF, companies from Korea and the People's Republic of China. And we are also considering proposals from two American companies – General Electric and NuScale – we are studying technologies for installing small modular reactors.” He confirmed that the decision will be made after the referendum.",
            "In August, the Energy Ministry had provided an update on previously conducted studies related to the choice of reactor technologies and siting for Kazakhstan’s first NPP.

The team commended the Romanian authorities for their effective preparations for the future deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) and made some recommendations for improvement.",
            "The 12-day mission was conducted at the request of the Government of Romania and hosted by the National Commission for Nuclear Activities Control (CNCAN), the national regulatory authority for the safety and security of nuclear facilities and activities. The 20-member team comprised 16 senior regulatory experts from 15 countries, as well as three IAEA staff members and one observer from the European Commission.

Romania plans to host a demonstration lead-cooled fast reactor for the development of a Generation-IV Lead-cooled Fast Reactor technology. In addition, medical and industrial applications of radioactive sources are widely used. Romania operates one waste disposal facility and plans to build two more, including one deep geological repository.",
            "The mission marks the start of the third IRRS mission cycle to Romania after previous missions in 2006 and 2011. This latest mission is a full-scope mission and covered all facilities and activities.",
            "“Romania has a comprehensive and mature regulatory infrastructure for nuclear safety.

            "The team recognised Romania’s inclusion of medical exposure oversight in the scope of this mission as a sign of openness, transparency, and commitment to continuous improvement for safety. However, the team noted that one of Romania’s key challenges was to better define and coordinate radiation protection roles and responsibilities between CNCAN and the Ministry of Health, which both deal with radiation source facilities and activities.",
            "The other main challenge was for the Government to ensure adequate resources for CNCAN. In addition, CNCAN should assess its organisational structure and develop a comprehensive human resource plan to manage available resources efficiently. The IRRS team made several recommendations and suggestions, including:",

        "text": [
            "Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and Oregon-based NuScale Power have mutually agreed to terminate the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP). The project envisaged construction of six small modular reactors (SMRs) at the US Department of Energy's (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL). “Despite significant efforts by both parties to advance the CFPP, it appears unlikely that the project will have enough subscription to continue toward deployment.” A joint statement said. “Therefore, UAMPS and NuScale have mutually determined that ending the project is the most prudent decision for both parties.”",
            "Since UAMPS announced its plan to develop the CFPP using NuScale SMRs in 2015, the parameters of the project have changed several times. In 2015, the plan was for 12 50MWe NuScale AMR modules for a plant that could produce a total of 600 MWe. This increased to 720MWe, when UAMPS opted to scale up to 60MWe modules. Subsequently, in 2021, UAMPS participants chose to build 77MWe modules but downsized the plant from 12 units to six, which would yield 462 MWe.",
            "UAMPS, a political subdivision of the state of Utah established in 1980, is a consortium of cities in Utah, Idaho, New Mexico and Nevada. As a project-based energy services entity, UAMPS provides a range of power supply, transmission, and other services to its 50 members, which include public power utilities in seven western states: Utah, Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, and Wyoming. CFPP Partners include NuScale Power (developer of the nuclear power modules), Fluor Corporation (construction and licensing contractor), and DOE.",
            "In late 2020, DOE awarded the cooperative $1.35bn over 10 years for the project, subject to congressional appropriations. CFPP at that time had 33 participants. The number has since fallen to 27.",
            "In March this year, NuScale placed its first upper reactor pressure vessel (RPV) long lead material (LLM) production order with Doosan Enerbility intended for the CFPP. This was shortly after CFPP participants had agreed to continue the development and deployment of the project despite rising costs. In January, NuScale had said the target price for power from the plant would be $89 per MWh, a 53% increase on the previous estimate of $58 per MWh.",
            "This had led to concerns that potential customers may be unwilling to pay so much for the power generated. UAMPS, nevertheless, approved the budget and finance plan with 26 of its 27 members supporting it. The CFPP was then expected to begin operation in 2030.",
            "However, January also saw the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issue its final rule certifying NuScale’s SMR design, making it the first SMR to be certified by the agency. In July, CFPP applied to NRC for a Limited Work Authorisation (LWA), requesting approval to start early construction activities before receiving a Combined Licence (COLA). The LWA application was the first part of the project’s COLA, with submission of the second part planned for January 2024. NRC in September docketed CFPP’s application for a LWA, setting set an end date for review of August 2025.",
            "NuScale Power was the first SMR developer to undergo a business combination to progress commercialisation of its technology. In May 2022, it had merged with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp to create the world's first publicly traded SMR technology provider.",
            "However, earlier this month, the company came under pressure after a lengthy report by Iceberg Research entitled “NuScale Power ($SMR): A fake customer and a major contract in peril cast doubt on NuScale’s viability”. Iceberg alleged that NuScale had sold 24 reactors to a “fake customer”. This referenced a deal NuScale had announced in October to supply Standard Power with 1,848 MWe of power provided by 24 SMRs to power two US data centre sites. Iceberg predicted that Standard Power would be unable to support the contract. NuScale, in response said the Iceberg allegations were “riddled with speculative statements with no basis in fact and demonstrates a limited understanding of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and the nuclear power industry.”",
            "NuScale President & CEO John Hopkins, commenting on the cancellation of the CFPP noted that through the company’s work with UAMPS and partnership with DOE, it had “advanced our NuScale Power Modules to the point that utilities, governments and industrials can rely on a proven small modular reactor (SMR) technology that has regulatory approval and is in active production”.",
            "He added: “Our work with CFPP over the past ten years has advanced NuScale technology to the stage of commercial deployment; reaching that milestone is a tremendous success which we will continue to build on with future customers. NuScale will continue with our other domestic and international customers to bring our American SMR technology to market and grow the US nuclear manufacturing base, creating jobs across the US.\"",
            "UAMPS CEO & General Manager Mason Baker said: \"This decision is very disappointing given the years of pioneering hard work put into the CFPP by UAMPS, CFPP LLC, NuScale, US Department of Energy, and the UAMPS member communities that took the leadership role to launch the CFPP. Yet, this decision is the best course for the UAMPS members participating in the CFPP and doing what is best for those member communities will always be the guiding light in such decisions.”",
            "He added: “We have learned many invaluable lessons during the development of the CFPP that we will carry forward in future development work to meet the future energy needs of the UAMPS member communities. We look forward to continuing to provide innovative and cost-effective new resource solutions to our members, and, at the same time, we hope NuScale is successful in deploying its technology.\" NuScale’s share price fell by over 40% on the news of the cancellation.",
            "DOE had provided $232m for the UAMPS project since October 2020. A DOE spokesperson said the work will be valuable in the future, adding: “\"While not every project is guaranteed to succeed, DOE remains committed to doing everything we can to deploy these technologies to combat the climate crisis and increase access to clean energy.\"",
            "The collapse of the project is raising questions in other countries with SMR plans. Commenting on the situation, Canada-based The Energy Mix said.",
            "The failure of the US project “is shining a light on public subsidies that might keep similar technology under development in Canada, even if it’s prone to the same cost overruns that scuttled NuScale Power Corporation’s Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) in Utah”.",
            "The publication quoted Gordon Edwards, President of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, as saying: “Private investors in Utah forced NuScale to divulge financial information regarding the cost of electricity from its proposed nuclear plant,” and “cost became the deal-breaker”. He added: “Publicly-owned utilities in Canada are not similarly accountable. The public has little opportunity to ‘hold their feet to the fire’ and determine just how much electricity is going to cost, coming from these first-of-a-kind new nuclear reactors.”",
            "Similarly, Romanian Insider noted: “The small nuclear reactor (SMR) technology and the SMR project in Romania came under scrutiny after NuScale dropped one of his projects in the US because of the excessive costs that increased by 53% and made it economically inefficient.” In Romania, NuScale is developing a similar SMR project at Doicesti. NuScale now has four projects under development in the US, one in Canada, three in Asia, one in the Middle East and three in Europe (Poland, Bulgaria and Romania).",

            "The nuclear fuel used in NPPs today has changed little since the initial deployment of nuclear power more than half a century ago. The fuel design for water-cooled reactors since the dawn of the nuclear power industry has been based on ceramic uranium oxide (UO2) fuel pellets, enriched to less than 5% U-235, contained in zirconium-alloy cladding tubes.",
            "While continuous incremental improvements have been made on this basic fuel design, and modern commercial nuclear fuel outperforms the original fuel, modern fuel still consists of the same basic design elements of UO2 fuel pellets contained in zirconium-alloy cladding tubes. Incremental advancements in the performance of this fuel design may continue, but far-reaching advancements in commercial nuclear fuel performance will likely require fundamental changes.",
            "Conversely, Lightbridge’s advanced metallic fuel rod design, being developed for use in existing water-cooled reactors and water-cooled SMRs, is fundamentally different than current fuel and offers a host of simultaneous step-change improvements.",
            "Lightbridge metallic fuel rods are multi-lobed and helically twisted, consisting of a metallic uranium-zirconium alloy fuel core, that is co-extruded and metallurgically bonded to a zirconium-alloy cladding, and a central zirconium-alloy displacer that can be alloyed with burnable poisons.",
            "The fuel core is an alloy consisting of approximately 50% uranium and 50% zirconium by weight. The uranium component of the fuel alloy can be enriched up to 19.75% U-235. Enrichment above 5% and below 20% is known as High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium or HALEU. The cladding is composed of a zirconium alloy that is standard in conventional nuclear fuel. The helically twisted design provides self-spacing of the rods in a fuel assembly, eliminating the need for spacer grids.",
            "Because of its design features, the metallic fuel has inherently superior technical performance in several key areas compared to conventional cylindrical fuel rods consisting of UO2 pellets in zirconium-alloy cladding tubes:",
            "Lightbridge metallic fuel has significantly higher thermal conductivity than ceramic UO2 fuel, and since Lightbridge cladding is metallurgically bonded to the fuel, there is no fuel-cladding gas gap as in conventional fuel rods. This results in Lightbridge Fuel operating at lower fuel temperatures, which translates into increased safety margins and better performance in normal, off-normal, and accident scenarios.",
            "The multilobed, helically twisted design of the Lightbridge Fuel rods provides a significantly higher heat transfer area and greatly improved coolant mixing than cylindrical fuel rods. Since Lightbridge fuel rods are self-spacing and do not require spacer grids, they can accommodate increased coolant flow rates with lower pressure drop across the core. The use of the low pressure-drop Lightbridge Fuel is notably advantageous in SMRs that use natural circulation and passive safety systems.",
            "Lightbridge Fuel uses HALEU, containing adequate fissionable material to achieve power uprates, cycle-length extensions, and reach high burn-ups in light water reactors, reaching up to 50% or more burn-up beyond the current commercial fuel limits.",
            "Mechanical integrity of the cladding:",
            "Lightbridge Fuel utilises standard zirconium-alloy cladding material. However, unlike conventional pellet-in-tube fuel rods, the cladding is metallurgically bonded to the fuel and serves primarily as a barrier to fission product release instead of being the fuel rod’s primary structural component. As such, Lightbridge cladding is not subjected to the same mechanical stresses as in conventional fuel rods, allowing the fuel rod to maintain its mechanical integrity (both structurally and as a fission product barrier) to high burn-ups. Additionally, since the cladding is metallurgically bonded to the fuel, any breach of the cladding will only result in an isolated and localised amount of fuel being exposed to the coolant, reducing the consequences of a cladding breach.",
            "Mechanical integrity of the fuel:",
            "The fuel exhibits low swelling and excellent fission product retention in water-cooled reactor conditions, ensuring that the uranium-zirconium fuel alloy maintains its mechanical integrity and that low stresses are imparted on the cladding from the fuel. The co-extruded metallic fuel and cladding comprise a robust fuel rod design that withstands other mechanical loads from power transients, flow-induced vibration, seismic events.",
            "The significantly reduced amount of U-238 in fresh Lightbridge metallic fuel contributes to improved proliferation resistance, since much less plutonium is produced during irradiation and it is in a proliferation-resistant isotopic mix.",
            "Since Lightbridge Fuel can achieve high end-of-life burn-ups, the throughput of fuel required to operate water-cooled reactors (including for uprated power and extended cycle lengths) is significantly reduced, resulting in lower waste volumes.",
            "These advantages inherent to the fuel design enable it to operate at higher power over longer time at lower fuel operating temperatures, with increased safety margins, while producing less waste that is more proliferation resistant than current fuel. The robust mechanical design makes it inherently better suited to withstand power adjustments, offering enhanced operational flexibility and enabling both large plants and SMRs to load follow.",
            "The fuel design is an improved version of a mature fuel technology that incorporated uranium-zirconium fuel alloy composition and was used for decades in water-cooled maritime reactors. Improvements made in the design to optimise it for use in commercial water-cooled reactors include adding the central displacer to reduce fuel temperatures, using a modern nuclear fuel cladding alloy, and implementing the multi-lobed geometry for optimised heat transfer and coolant mixing. The maritime fuel used high-enriched uranium, and exhibited excellent performance to very high burn-ups, up to more than double the current end-of-life burn-up limits for commercial nuclear fuel. Since Lightbridge Fuel uses HALEU instead of high-enriched uranium, the expected burn-up levels are well within the experience base of maritime fuel, giving high confidence that it will demonstrate robust performance through its end of life in water-cooled NPPs and SMRs.",
            "In support of future qualification and licensing efforts, the Lightbridge team together with several research institutions have conducted numerous studies, including simulation studies in a variety of conditions in various types of water-cooled reactors, thermal-hydraulic and vibration experiments, proof-of-concept irradiation testing of extruded multi-lobed fuel rodlets in a research reactor, as well as preliminary demonstration of manufacturing processes. Additionally, two GAIN Voucher awards enabled Idaho National Laboratory (INL) to design an Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) capsule irradiation experiment for the fuel, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) performed casting demonstration work for manufacturing ingots of the fuel alloy using depleted uranium and zirconium alloy.",
            "Lightbridge is currently conducting fuel development activities at INL, where the scope of work includes refinement of fabrication processes, irradiation testing of fuel material coupons, and corresponding post irradiation examinations of the irradiated materials. These studies will validate, under nuclear quality assurance standards, fundamental material properties during irradiation and are aimed to inform subsequent testing on rodlets under various conditions in the ATR and the Transient Reactor Test Facility (TREAT).",
            "Additionally, two ongoing studies, funded through the US Department of Energy (DOE) Nuclear Energy University Program (NEUP) – one led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and one led by Texas A&M University – are being conducted to investigate neutronic, thermal, and thermal hydraulic performance of the fuel in NuScale SMRs under normal and off-normal conditions, via simulation studies and laboratory experiments. These ongoing fuel development activities support the goal of licensing Lightbridge metallic fuel rods for use in existing NPPs and water-cooled SMRs.",
            "Use in existing and future reactors",
            "Lightbridge Fuel can be used in both existing nuclear power plants and small modular reactors designed to use conventional nuclear fuel, with no major plant modifications. In both cases, this enables step-change improvements in safety, fuel performance, waste reduction, and proliferation resistance. This leads directly to improved power plant economics, since the plant can produce more energy over a longer period between refueling outages, and operational flexibility is enhanced. For example, using the fuel in a four-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR) can enable a 10% power uprate and a fuel-cycle extension from 18 to 24 months, without the need for significant plant modifications.",
            "In new-build reactors, including gigawatt-scale NPPs and SMRs, the balance-of-plant equipment can be designed to make optimal use of the advanced fuel that can enable power uprates of up to 30% above levels achievable with conventional fuel.",
            "SMRs are designed to be faster to build, require a smaller upfront capital investment than large reactors, and aim to achieve economies of series production.",
            "Use of the Lightbridge fuel in SMRs to increase power density while maintaining robust safety margins can also make them more economical and further enhance SMRs’ competitiveness with other energy sources.",
            "In a future where the global installed nuclear capacity is dramatically increased to meet climate goals, it is likely that new installed capacity will consist of both gigawatt-scale NPPs and SMRs. Due to its ability to operate with high power density and its inherently robust design, the use of the Lightbridge fuel in future water-cooled NPPs and SMRs would require building fewer reactors to achieve the same installed capacity.",
            "Lightbridge Fuel constitutes a significant advancement in water-cooled reactor fuel, offering improvements in safety, fuel performance, waste reduction, proliferation resistance, and power plant economics. It promises to set a new standard for nuclear fuel for water-cooled reactors.",

I remain confident in X-energy’s attractive value proposition, and I appreciate the support we have received from AAC and other investors.”",
            "X-energy CEO J Clay Sell team listed the company’s accomplishments in the last year. “We have advanced the initial deployment of four Xe-100 units with Dow on the Texas Gulf Coast, signed a joint development agreement with Energy Northwest for up to 12 Xe-100 units in central Washington, progressed the Xe-100 from basic design to the Final Design Readiness Review phase and signed a cooperative agreements with both the US Department of Defense and US Department of Energy to further advance the development of a mobile microreactor design.”",
            "He continued: “Looking ahead, we will continue to execute against our strategy that capitalises on our proprietary clean energy technology, competitive advantages and strategic relationships to the benefit of our customers and stakeholders around the world.”",
            "David Kaplan, AAC Co-Chairman & CEO, and Co-Founder, Director & Partner of Ares Management Corporation said: “While the persistently volatile public market conditions over the course of 2023 have led to this mutual decision, we remain steadfast in our belief in X-energy’s exceptional talent, differentiated nuclear technology and mission to deliver affordable, zero-carbon energy on a global scale.” An investment vehicle affiliated with Ares Management Corporation has agreed to make a private investment into X-energy in order to support its continued growth as a private company.",
            "Neither party is required to pay the other a termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the agreement. AAC determined that it will not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and intends to dissolve and liquidate. AAC anticipates that the last day of trading in the public shares will be 6 November",
            "In December 2022, the business combination had ascribed a pre-money equity value of approximately $2bn to X-energy, the companies said. The transaction was then expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 subject to approvals. In June, X-energy and AAC updated their agreement that revising X-energy's pre-money equity value sown to $1.8bn. In September, Ares had increased its total investment to $80m through a $50m PIPE investment on top of an initial $30m investment announced in December 2022.",
            "X-energy is developing its Xe-100 pebble bed high-temperature gas reactor design with an output of 200 MWt or 80 MWe using TRISO (tri-structural isotropic) fuel. X-energy says the reactor, optimised as a four-unit plant delivering 320 MWe, can provide baseload power to an electricity system or use its thermal output to support industrial applications with high pressure, high temperature steam.",
            "In January this year, X-energy announced a strategic investment of $25m from South Korea's DL E&C and Doosan Enerbility in a private round of financing to advance the global deployment of the Xe-100.",
            "NuScale Power was the first SMR developer to undergo a business combination to progress commercialisation of its technology. In May 2022, it merged with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp to create the world's first publicly traded SMR technology provider.",
            "However, NuScale is also facing difficulties after a lengthy report by Iceberg Research entitled “Nuscale Power ($SMR): A fake customer and a major contract in peril cast doubt on NuScale’s viability”. Iceberg alleged that NuScale had sold 24 reactors to a “fake customer”. This referenced a deal NuScale announced in October to supply Standard Power with 1,848 MWe of power provided by 24 SMRs to power two US data centre sites. Iceberg predicts Standard Power will be unable to support the contract. NuScale said the Iceberg allegations were “riddled with speculative statements with no basis in fact and demonstrates a limited understanding of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and the nuclear power industry.”",
            "Iceberg says in a disclaimer: “Our research and reports express our opinions, which we have based upon generally available public information, field research, inferences and deductions through our due diligence and analytical process. To the best of our ability and belief, all information contained herein is accurate and reliable, and has been obtained from public sources we believe to be accurate.”",
            "The Standard Power deal is bigger than NuScale’s other contract, with the government-backed Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) to provide Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) with 462 MWe. Iceberg said NuScale has “around 15 months before its cash runs out” and that the UAMPS contract is reaching a crucial stage. Overall shares in NuScale have fallen around 75% since their peak in late 2022, from around $14 to around $3.5.",
            "NuScale said it “will not engage in a point-by-point rebuttal of every falsehood” but added that is important to set the record straight on some key points. “We are proud that developers and customers are selecting NuScale SMRs as their technology of choice to power their projects and meet their carbon-free energy objectives.”",
            "NuScale says: “Standard Power conducted a comprehensive review of baseload, reliable and secure power sources that are the most critical component for operating data centres in the AI-sector. That comprehensive and independent study led Standard Power to select NuScale’s SMRs as the technology of choice for its power facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania.” NuScale said it has analysed Standard Power’s extensive data room “and is confident that our power modules are appropriate for the selected sites”. It added that Standard Power has already begun site preparation.",
            "NuScale expects customer agreements to drive revenue next year. “NuScale generates cash and revenue from three sources: the sale and delivery of NuScale Power Modules, licensing support, and services provided. NuScale has already generated income from services for our committed customers and we expect our customer agreements to generate additional revenue in 2024.”",
            "NuScale says it has $197m in total cash and no debt as of 30 September. “The Company’s customer agreements will continue to drive NuScale towards cash flow profitability and our healthy balance sheet enables access to sources of capital as needed.”",
            "With respect to the CFPP project, NuScale says it has its own project challenges “not attributable to NuScale’s SMR technology”. It adds: “The work we have completed to date has advanced our nuclear power modules to the point that utilities, governments and industrials can rely on a proven SMR technology that has regulatory approval, is in active production and is ready for commercial deployment.”",
            "\"NuScale’s Senior Leadership and Board of Directors stand firmly behind the strength of our business,\" said John Hopkins, NuScale President and CEO. \"Not only do we have a solid, debt-free balance sheet and a talented and dedicated team, but we are years ahead of the global competition as the only SMR technology provider and producer with US regulatory approval and that is ready for commercial deployment. We are confident in our position to drive the global energy transition and we look forward to continuing to lead.\""

            "RR Standard Power, which supplies infrastructure as a service to advanced data processing companies, plans to develop two facilities powered by small modular reactors (SMRs) producing 2 GWe in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The projects will use technology from US NuScale Power Corporation and ENTRA1 Energy to supply energy to nearby data centres. NuScale will provide its SMR technology – the only SMR design approved by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "In 2022, NuScale formed an exclusive global partnership with ENTRA1 to commercialise NuScale’s SMR technology whereby ENTRA1 has the rights to develop, manage, own and operate energy production plants powered by NuScale SMRs.",
            "\"We see a lot of legacy baseload grid capacity going offline with a lack of new sustainable baseload generation options on the market especially as power demand for artificial intelligence-computing and data centres is growing,” said Maxim Serezhin, Standard Power Founder & CEO. “We look forward to working with ENTRA1 and NuScale to deploy NuScale’s proven SMR technology to deliver carbon-free, baseload energy to address this large gap in the generation market.\"",
            "He added: “By bringing together ENTRA1’s superior strengths in project development and investment with NuScale’s proven SMR technology, consumers can reduce their emissions footprint and help meet decarbonisation goals while delivering the reliable 24/7 service to energy consumers.\"",
            "Clayton Scott, NuScale Chief Commercial Officer said ENTRA1 Energy has a strong global pipeline of energy production projects totalling multiple gigawatts of power generation using NuScale’s technology. \"Together, we can more effectively meet the growing demands for renewable, carbon-free energy solutions. With power demand growing in the semiconductor, artificial intelligence, data and other tech sectors, ENTRA1 and NuScale are uniquely positioned to supply baseload and reliable power.\"",
            "NuScale’s VOYGR SMR plants are powered by the NuScale Power Module, a small PWR that can generate 77 MWe or 250 MWt (gross), and can be scaled to meet customer needs through an array of flexible configurations up to 924 MWe (12 modules). NuScale says the design is being considered for deployment by more than 10 countries. It describes it as \"based on proven pressurised water-cooled reactor technology, and was developed to supply energy for electrical generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications\".",
            "NuScale Power Modules are fully factory-fabricated with no in-field construction and operate with conventional nuclear fuel, which is widely available and has an established regulatory framework. This keeps costs low, consistent and predictable – and makes power plants using NuScale technology less expensive to build, operate and maintain. NuScale President &CEO John Hopkins noted: \"By deploying our innovative NuScale SMR Technology to more consumers around the world, we’re taking an important step toward addressing the world’s enormous decarbonisation needs.\"",
            "Standard Power’s plans for the two facilities will require NuScale to provide 24 units of 77 MWe modules collectively producing 1,848 MWe from both the Ohio and Pennsylvania sites. Standard Power estimates that each proposed SMR-powered data centre project will employ a significant number of skilled workers during the construction period. Standard Power will leverage its local community partnerships to advance education programmes as well as job creation programmes focusing on local labour."

            "The UK Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) and Great British Nuclear (GBN) have selected six companies to advance to next phase of the small modular reactor (SMR) competition for innovative nuclear technologies.",
            "The companies are EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International , Holtec Britain Limited, US-based NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited. The government and GBM said the chosen designs are considered as the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s. The next stage of the process will be launched as soon as possible where successful companies will shortly be able to bid for government contracts. The aim is to announce in Spring 2024 which of the companies the government will support, with contracts awarded by Summer 2024. “This timetable aims to make this competition the fastest of its kind in the world,” DESNZ noted.",
            "The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) competition is part of the government’s plan to revive nuclear power and for the UK to lead the global race to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper energy and greater energy security. The government aims for up to a quarter of all UK electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The statement pointed out that, “as well as backing SMRs and other emerging nuclear technologies, the government is also investing in the large-scale project at Sizewell C, a near exact replica of Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be in construction for over a generation”.",
            "Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said SMRs “will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy for British families and businesses, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and grow the economy”. She added: “This competition has attracted designs from around the world and puts the UK at the front of the global race to develop this exciting, cutting-edge technology and cement our position as a world leader in nuclear innovation.”",
            "Minister for Nuclear & Networks Andrew Bowie said the programme “provides the blueprint for how the government can work together with industry to grow the economy and set the future of new, exciting nuclear technologies”.",
            "Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN CEO, said: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029. These companies will now be able to prepare for the next stages of the competition, aiming for a final contract agreement in the summer, potentially benefiting from significant support from the public purse.”",
            "The government’s objective has been to select technologies which offer the greatest confidence in being able to make a final investment decision in 2029 and be operational in the mid-2030s.",
            "For companies who were not successful in this initial process, the next opportunity could be the government’s consultation on alternative routes to market for nuclear technologies which is due to be launched soon. This will look at how to support newer technologies so that the UK can benefit from them as well.",
            "The government is set to consult later in the year on how best to ensure other nuclear technologies can potentially get underway in the UK – and this could include some of the technologies that were not selected through this process.",
            "The six technologies selected all depend to a large extent on traditional nuclear technology. The 470 MWe Rolls-Royce SMR design is based on a small pressurised water reactor. The design was accepted for UK Generic Design Assessment review in March 2022 and Rolls-Royce SMR expects to receive UK regulatory approval by mid-2024. A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium – which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI – expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.",

            "The company noted that the SMR will also be able to provide energy for the manufacture of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. It will occupy approximately one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear generation site, thereby reducing local ecological impacts. The SMR will be factory built, enabling completed modules to be transported by truck, train or barge, reducing vehicle movements and completion risk and increasing build time certainty.",

The Centre is supported by the US Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) capacity building programme. The US mission statement says FIRST “supports Romania’s leadership in being a trailblazer in Europe to deploy SMR technology, and in training the workforce of the future to advance climate action, energy security, and energy access throughout Europe and the world”.",
            "The E2 Centre simulator “fulfils the commitment made by [US] Ambassador Bonnie Jenkins, Under Secretary of State for Arms Control & International Security, at the Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26),” the US mission noted. “As part of the ‘Nuclear Futures Package’, the Under Secretary announced a SMR simulator to support Romania’s ambitious civil nuclear energy programme and stated desire to be a SMR hub in the region. Romania, with more than 26 years of experience in safe nuclear power operations and performance is an ideal partner in deploying the first SMR in Europe. This technical assistance builds upon the US-Romania Intergovernmental Agreement for cooperation on Romania’s civil nuclear power programme (IGA) signed in December 2020, cementing a multi-decade relationship on civil nuclear advancement.”",
            "The US-Romania partnership has developed significantly since 2019, when SNN and NuScale signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to evaluate the development, authorisation and construction of SMRs in Romania. This was followed by the IGA in 2020, while US Exim Bank concluded a MOU with Romania’s Ministry of Energy, on energy investment projects in Romania totalling $7bn. In 2021 NuScale and SNN signed a collaboration agreement to accelerate the implementation of the first SMR in Europe.

The 26 years of Romanian safe operation expertise are the basis for further developing Romania’s nuclear energy programme. The energy transition is not possible without maintaining and expanding the role of nuclear power and it requires strong international partnerships, like the one we are enhancing today. I thank our American partners for their continuous support.”",
            "NuScale Power said its 2021 teaming agreement with SNN aimed to deploy a 462 MWe NuScale VOYGR-6 power plant in Romania by the end of the decade. It added that NuScale and RoPower had already begun front-end engineering and design work for the Doicesti site as the preferred location for the deployment of the VOYGR power plant.",

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company has submitted its pre-application Regulatory Engagement Plan with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for its recently launched AP300 small modular reactor (SMR). Westinghouse claims it is the only SMR “truly based on an Nth-of-a-kind operating plant” and describes it as a “game-changer”. The 300 MWe single-loop pressurised water reactor is a scaled-down version of its AP1000.",
            "It will utilise identical AP1000 technology, to include major equipment, structural components, passive safety, proven fuel, and I&C systems. Westinghouse says the AP300 “will bring to bear a mature supply chain, constructability lessons learned, fast load-follow capabilities and proven O&M procedures and best practices from 18 reactor years of safe AP1000 operations.”",
            "The advanced passive safety system “automatically achieves safe shutdown without operator action and eliminates the need for backup power and cooling supply”. This also directly translates into a simplified design, lower CAPEX and smaller footprint. Like the AP1000, the AP300 is designed to operate for an 80+ year life cycle.",
            "Westinghouse notes that the Gen III+ technology has regulatory approval in the US, the UK and China, as well as compliance with European Utility Requirements (EUR) standards for NPPs. “Design certification is anticipated by 2027, followed by site specific licensing and construction on the first unit toward the end of the decade.”",
            "Westinghouse President & CEO Patrick Fragman said it is “the only SMR offering available that is based on deployed, operating and advanced reactor technology”. He added: \"It is using the DNA of the AP1000 in terms of technology.\" It “has unique advantages in terms of robustness of the safety case, simplicity of the design, with huge implications in terms of costs and time to construct and obviously an ease of deployment because, with the AP1000 being already deployed, the AP300 SMR will leverage the existing supply chain, the existing design, the existing licensing pedigree\". Fragman described it as “no more and no less than an AP1000 with one loop instead of two loops”. This means it is reusing a majority of components, systems, equipment. “The fuel is identical, the constructability lessons are identical,\" he said.",
            "Dr Rita Baranwal, currently Westinghouse Chief Technology Officer, has been named as Senior Vice President in the Energy Systems business unit and will lead the team developing the AP300 SMR. Baranwal is a former Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy at the US Department of Energy and was director of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative at Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "Currently, the AP1000 is not licensed or operating anywhere in Europe. In the USA, two AP1000 reactors are under construction at the Vogle NPP (units 3&4) in Georgia. Unit 3 was finally connected to the grid in April and unit 4 is nearing completion. However, both are significantly delayed and overbudget. When construction began in 2009 they were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017. Cost has more than doubled.",
            "Two Westinghouse AP1000 units are in operation at each of China’s Sanmen and Haiyang NPPs after some delays and two CAP1000 units, the Chinese version of the AP1000, are being built as the second phase at each station. The proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at China’s Lufeng NPP was approved by the National Development & Reform Commission but has not yet received State Council approval. Plans to build further AP1000 units in China, however, have been dropped in favour of Chinese Hualong-One units.",
            "Westinghouse has, meanwhile, been lobbying hard in former Eastern European countries. As a result, AP1000 units have recently been selected in Poland and are being considered by Bulgaria, while nine others are planned in Ukraine.",
            "As to SMRs, the AP300 may face stiff competition. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is also planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",

        "text": [
            "The small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses. (Credit: Wim van ‘t Einde on Unsplash)",
            "The nuclear industry hopes that small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses of the energy system; supplied as a package, delivered in modules that can be quickly and easily assembled on-site and providing heat or power to neighbouring customers or to the grid as a whole.",
            "In theory, using a small modular technology that is quickly rolled out in numbers allows the supply chain to make efficiencies, builds operating experience for owners and investors alike and drives the technology down the “cost curve”. That process has become familiar in the energy industry as wind turbines, solar PV and batteries have been rolled out in numbers that have risen from a few hundred units to become a mainstay of the energy industry in less than two decades. In fact the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted in its March report that between 2010 and 2019 “sustained decreases” saw unit costs fall by 85% for solar PV, by 55% for wind power and by 85% for lithium ion batteries. That came with deployment at the end of the period 10 times that at the start for solar PV.",
            "Can nuclear SMRs follow the same route? Or has the industry’s current scattergun approach limited its opportunity to follow other clean energy technologies down the cost curve?",
            "There are several consistent aspects to technologies that have successfully negotiated the curve. They are (initially) small; a single familiar technology has been used; it has been rolled out in numbers; they can be accommodated on a variety of sites; experience of the first projects has been quickly absorbed; and that data has given third party financiers confidence to invest in follow-on projects. Lithium ion batteries, for example, are being rolled out at gigawatt scale, yet the largest installations, housed in facilities very like shipping containers, contain arrays of familiar small batteries. Innovation has been required in operating them as a mass array, integrating them with the grid, developing markets for the services they can offer (response, rather than baseload power) and modelling and managing the best operating regimes. Now there is ‘market pull’ as electricity system operators value the services they can provide.",
            "SMRs are still at the ‘market push’ stage. The International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) says it is aware of more than 80 designs that have been mooted, but its Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS) lists 48 reactor designs in the SMR category that are at some point in the design phase. In fact, nearly a dozen of those actually fall outside IAEA’s own SMR definition, which puts an upper limit of 300 MWe on the reactor rating and the 300 MWe designation also means some of the more elderly conventional designs, such as India’s PHWR, are included in IAEA SMR listings.",
            "The IAEA’s ARIS list has seven distinct types of technology at an early or late stage of design, with designs varying within each class. A dozen are versions of light water reactors that might be considered closest to the PWRs and BWRs that currently form the majority of working reactors. Seven are based around lead coolant, nine around sodium coolant and five around lead bismuth coolant. Six have helium coolant and five are based around fluoride and graphite. Two combine a graphite moderator with a molten salt coolant.",
            "Reducing costs by replication requires ‘learning by doing’ – ie building the reactors. That requires several issues to fall into place: a well-understood design, ideally with an operating track record, and a pipeline of sites that gives the supply chain confidence to invest. Where has the SMR industry reached in that process?",
            "An SMR barrier that is not faced by many other types of electricity generation is the nuclear licence. This requires both a licence for the technology and for the site and it is a bottleneck that each technology has to pass through. The first to do so was NuScale, which won design approval for the six-module VOYGR variant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January this year. However, design approval for the technology does not necessarily mean it can be installed at a chosen site. The US NRC approval for NuScale allows a utility or other operator to reference the design, but the operator has still has to apply for a combined licence to build and operate it as a nuclear power plant anywhere in the USA.",
            "Likely to be the next to receive design approval is the GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which “leverages the design and licensing basis” of GEH’s US NRC-certified ESBWR. It was entered into the US NRC licensing process in 2020. BWRX-300 has already completed phases one and two of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s (CNSC) vendor design review process and in December 2022 GEH announced that it has submitted it into the UK’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA).",
            "The UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) also last year took on GDA of a new reactor from the UK’s Rolls Royce SMR. The reactor is described as an SMR by the company, although at 440 MWe it is considerably above the IAEA’s upper limit to meet that definition.",
            "All three of these designs are based on well-known nuclear technology that has been deployed and has a track record of operation. Although the SMR version has numerous differences, these designs are likely to have the familiarity needed for mass rollout.",
            "What has been the progress towards choosing sites for the potential SMR fleet?",
            "In contrast to large nuclear units, which are necessarily much more influenced by site characteristics, the key requirement for SMRs is replication. That means the site should be able to host several units or there should be a large number of potential sites available. It is no surprise that the technologies that have passed furthest through the design licensing process have a head start when naming sites for deployment.",
            "NuScale’s progress through the licensing process has given it a strong position in raising potential buyer interest. It is selling its 77 MWe NuScale plant in three, six or 12 unit versions branded as ‘VOYGRTM’ and it is working with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) on a combined licence application for a six-module plant to be sited at the Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "The application will be submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) next year and is targeting units to start up in 2029 and 2030. The UAMPS consortium recently reapproved the project despite cost increases. UAMPS said a new budget plan “will move the small modular nuclear reactor project into an aggressive 2023 workplan, which focuses on completing the preparation of the application to construct and operate the plant, to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 2024.” This year it will also procure long lead material – NuScale Power has already placed an upper reactor pressure vessel order with Doosan Enerbility – and will develop a more detailed construction estimate.",
            "NuScale has signed agreements with two other utilities that could open the door to more deployment. They are via Dairyland Power (which serves Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois) and Associated Electric Cooperative Inc (which serves 2 million people in Missouri).",
            "In addition, NuScale Power has also unveiled a large number of Memoranda of Understanding with potential site owners in other countries. The most advanced is Romania’s RoPower Nuclear, which is owned equally by S.N. Nuclearelectrica and Nova Power & Gas, and which signed a contract with NuScale Power for front-end engineering and design (FEED) work in December. Phase 1 of the FEED work awarded to NuScale will define the major site and specific inputs for a VOYGR-6 plant to be deployed at the Doicesti power station. Importantly, Doicesti was not previously a nuclear site and instead has small coal-fired generation units.",
            "Similarly, in Poland, NuScale now has agreements with companies in which it is providing ‘support’ as they investigate deploying VOYGR at sites that have not hosted nuclear technology in the past. One is a joint venture of Unimot (which offers Polish wholesale and retail customers fuel products, gas and electricity) and Getka (a US energy company) and the other is KGHM, a Polish metals extraction company and a large industrial energy user. KGHM has already begun discussions with the National Atomic Energy Agency (NAEA) and has signed an early works agreement with NuScale.",
            "NuScale can also point to Memoranda of Understanding in Europe with Bulgaria, Ukraine and Czechia. Outside Europe it has similar agreements in Jordan and Kazakhstan. All, of course, require the reactor to be licensed.",
            "Also securing potential customers is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMR. It secured its first site last year when Ontario Power Generation selected it for deployment at Darlington. OPG aims to complete the first commercial construction at the site in 2028. Notably, GEH has signed project delivery agreements with SNC-Lavalin and Aecon for that project. Design acceptance by CNSC will give a head start for a second deployment by SaskPower which has selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan, although that is timed for the mid-2030s.",
            "This year GEH also announced that Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has begun planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site in Tennessee.",
            "The regulatory approval process has been kicked off in Poland, where Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners have submitted an application to Poland’s National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE says it wants to deploy “at least 10” BWRX-300s with the first in operation by the end of this decade. In addition, Fermi Energia announced that it had selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Estonia.",
            "Rolls Royce has not yet secured a site in its home market for its SMR. It believes the reactor will be of interest for so-called ‘industrial clusters’, areas which the UK has given a particular focus for decarbonisation. Government funding for the industrial clusters has been directed towards development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen production, rather than opening the sites for new nuclear. The new nuclear option is currently restricted to specific sites in England and Wales (Scotland has a moratorium on new nuclear) identified when the government decided to restart nuclear build 20 years ago. In the end the sites identified were previous nuclear sites. Planning law reform currently under way should widen that pool of sites but, currently, industrial sites would require special permission from government. However, Rolls Royce has also found willing partners in Poland. The state- owned Industria business, a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Agency JSC, has selected the Rolls-Royce SMR for the Central Hydrogen Cluster, with plans to produce 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen each year. It wants up to three units and Rolls-Royce SMR said that may open the door to “opportunities to replace more than 8 GW of coal-fired power plants in southern Poland with SMRs throughout the 2030s”.",
            "NuScale, GEH and Rolls Royce have sought design approval first and built customer numbers as the reactor advances through the process. But X-Energy may undertake the process in partnership.",
            "X-Energy is part of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) and will receive $1.2bn in cost shared funding from DOE over the life of the ARDP effort. Now it has signed a joint development agreement (JDA) with US chemicals conglomerate Dow to use X-Energy’s Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactor for process heat and electricity. The JDA scope includes the preparation and submission of a Construction Permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). X-energy is said to be preparing to submit a license application to the NRC.",
            "They plan to build X-Energy’s first unit at a Dow industrial site – one of several the company has along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Texas. A site is expected to be chosen by the end of this year.",
            "Dow represents a fleet deployment opportunity in itself – it operates manufacturing sites in 31 countries where the Xe-100 could be used to decarbonise operations. It may join forces with X-Energy to license the technology to other industrial customers as well as to power utilities. X-Energy had previously been in discussion with Energy Northwest and Grant County in Washington state, which would now have follow-on units.",
            "Clearly, the Polish market will be a kick-starter for the industry. That presents its own risks: the European market for new and existing nuclear is made more problematic because some of Poland’s fellow EU members are opposed to any type of nuclear power and will object to it. Equally, however, EU members would like to see Poland able to close its coal industry and clean up its energy industry as a whole and that may benefit SMRs.",
            "What about the large number of other technologies competing to roll out? It is likely that their opportunity will come after mass deployment of the leading options have created market ‘pull’. If the model of a small-scale reactor that is used on an industrial site is familiar to investors and to the public, it lowers those risks to deployment and can allow a new technology to be presented to an investor comfortable with accepting risk.",
            "Again, the battery market is instructive. Mass deployment of lithium ion batteries has developed both the supply chain for delivery and installation and the skill set for making returns for investors. Now the ‘market pull’ is there, attention has turned to the next technology. A recent analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance says “sodium ion batteries are more expensive than lithium ion today because of low volumes and underdeveloped supply chains. But BNEF sees potential for material savings and energy-density improvements that would provide a viable pathway for sodium ion cells to cost half what lithium iron phosphate does today”.",
            "The nuclear industry is grappling with deploying SMRs but two or three versions are showing the characteristics that have been successful for other asset classes. The technology is relatively familiar, while the small size of units mean they will be deploying in 10s, rather than singly. The question will be whether that can step up to the hundreds or thousands, to gain the true benefits of replication. That may see promising designs fall by the wayside – but that is an experience familiar across asset classes, when falling costs due to replication overtake a technology that would, on paper, look more economic. In that case experience suggests the broader energy industry and the investment community will “not let the best be the enemy of the good” and take a pragmatic decision: familiarity wins.",
            "Some SMRs are under construction worldwide are based on familiar light water designs, but are not obviously replicable in a ‘series build’ outside their home market.",
            "CAREM in Argentina is a small PWR, rated at 32 MW, intended to take advantage of an indigenous nuclear supply chain – some 70% of the components will come from Argentinian companies. In 2021 the Argentine government announced an effort to complete the reactor within three years, although the project has been in gestation for many years and dates back to the mid- 1980s. A potential follow-on project, planned for Formosa, is not identical as it would be rated at 100 MWe.",
            "China’s Linglong 1 project at Changjiang is also a small-version PWR, rated at 152 MWe and in 2016 it was the first SMR to pass a safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency. First concrete was poured in mid 2019 and late last year it was reported that equipment installation had begun.",
            "China and Russia have both named follow-up sites for their SMRs. China plans two 200 MW units in Baishan and Russia named Kurchatov in Kazakhstan as an expected home for two 300 MW units.",

He noted the potential use of small nuclear reactors for water desalination as well as power production.",
            "In an interview with Russia’s Sputnik, he said: “We have done all the studies. The infrastructure is in place, and studies on site selection and the provision of cooling water are in place. Now we are comparing technologies and we want to get the go-ahead from the government. There is a problem of providing water for cooling and a financing problem, and we are studying these details with all well-known companies, including the Russian ones, in order to choose the best model in Jordanian conditions.”",
            "Touqan said had been decided to use small reactors for water desalination and electricity generation, adding that the use of a floating NPP in Aqaba is being considered, but that may raise concerns among neighbouring countries. He ruled out the possibility that Jordan would be ready to construct a large reactor within the next 10 years, and that the choice of small reactors was justified because of potential water shortages.",
            "Russia and Jordan agreed in 2015 on two atomic reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts each, but in 2018 it was announced that Jordan had abandoned the project. In the same period, the two countries signed an agreement to develop a project to build a low-energy nuclear power unit (about 200 megawatts) in Jordan.",
            "Jordan had intended to have two 1000 MWe nuclear units in operation by 2025 but has now cancelled such plans. However, it had signed multiple nuclear cooperation agreements. The Committee for Nuclear Strategy, set up in 2007, had planned for nuclear power to provide 30% of electricity by 2030, and to provide for exports. In 2008 JAEC investigated plant technologies including AECL’s Candu-6, the Areva-Mitsubishi Atmea 1 and a KHNP design.",
            "In 2009 JAEC contracted Tractabel Engineering for a siting study at Al Amra in Al Mafraq province and signed WorleyParsons for the pre-construction phase of a two-unit plant. In 2013 JAEC decided on two AES-92 units on a build-own-operate basis with Rosatom Overseas. However, in 2018 the project was cancelled on the grounds of cost in favour of small modular reactors, and a new agreement was signed with Rosatom Overseas. A MOU was also signed with Rolls-Royce for an SMR feasibility study, and another with X-energy on its 76MWe Xe-100 HTGR. Talks were held with CNNC in 2018 on the possible construction of a 220MWe HTR-PM reactor for operation from 2025, and in 2019 an agreement was signed with US NuScale.",
            "Jordan has an operating research reactor. In 2009 JAEC selected a consortium headed by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute with Daewoo to build the 5 MWt Jordan Research & Training Reactor at the Jordan University for Science & Technology at Al Ramtha. The reactor, similar to South Korea's 30 MW Hanaro reactor, uses 19% enriched fuel and has the potential to be upgraded to 10 MWt. First criticality was in April 2016 and the reactor was commissioned in December."

The applications came after the adoption of an updated nuclear energy law allowing such applications to be submitted at the beginning of the process. This ensures state support for any project before any significant investment is made. A decision-in-principle formally confirms that investment in a plant is in line with public interest and the state policies, including energy policy.",
            "The decision will enable PEJ, a special purpose vehicle wholly owned by the State Treasury, to apply for subsequent administrative decisions, including a siting and a construction permit. PEJ’s application includes a description of project characteristics, such as the maximum total installed capacity, the planned operating period and details of the technology to be used in the construction of the plant.",
            "PEJ said the description provided was \"in line with government documents, including the resolution of the Council of Ministers of 2 November 2022, recognising the need to build a nuclear power plant with a capacity of up to 3750 MWe in the area of the communes of Choczewo or Gniewino and Krokowa and based on US AP1000 reactor technology\".",
            "It added: \"An important element of the application for the decision-in-principle is the justification of the importance of the implementation of this project for securing the electricity demand in Poland. The rationale also emphasises the compatibility of PEJ's project with strategic government documents, including Poland's Energy Policy until 2040 and the European Union's climate policy.\"",
            "PEJ acting President Łukasz Młynarkiewicz said the application represents another important step “towards obtaining all the necessary administrative approvals to begin construction of Poland's first nuclear power plant”. The application was submitted on the earliest date possible, “as we are keen to significantly accelerate the pace of implementation of this key project” and are also “aware of the significance of this project and the importance of the further stages before us, which we will implement according to the approved schedule”.",
            "In September 2021, Poland announced that six large pressurised water reactors with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040 to reduce its reliance on coal. Construction of the first NPP is to start in 2026, with the first 1.0-1.6 GWe reactor being commissioned in 2033. Subsequent units will be implemented every 2-3 years. The coastal towns of Lubiatowo and Kopalino in Choczewo municipality in Pomerania province were named as the preferred location for the first plant.",
            "\"The implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme is one of the greatest challenges Poland has faced in recent decades, both in terms of complexity and the competencies it demands,\" said Mateusz Berger, Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure. \"The submission of an application for the decision-in-principle for the construction of the first nuclear power plant marks an important stage showing the maturity of the project implemented in Pomerania.”",
            "In November 2022, the government selected Westinghouse to supply the plant. PEJ and Westinghouse signed a Bridge Contract in February, covering ten main areas, including: development of a detailed delivery model; preparation of a security assessment and a quality programme; and, also, identification of potential suppliers with a focus on Polish companies. Westinghouse will prepare a list of requirements necessary for the execution of the investment, including adjusting the AP1000 technology to meet local regulations. The contract assumes the preparation of the principles of external financing for the project.",
            "Meanwhile, Poland's ZE PAK, Polska Grupa Energetyczna and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power signed a letter of intent to cooperate on a NPP project in Patnow based on South Korean APR1400 reactors.",
            "The application by copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź is for a SMR. KGHM said that, until completion of the administrative procedure, it will not provide information on the course of the proceedings or details of the application. KGHM said it is one of the largest Polish companies and at the same time one of the largest energy consumers in the country. “That is why our involvement in energy projects, among which the nuclear project is of primary importance, is obvious, said Tomasz Zdzikot, President of the KGHM Management Board. “This is a project which will guarantee the stability of our operations in the future.”",
            "In 2022, KGHM signed an agreement with US NuScale Power for preliminary work representing the first step in the process of implementing SMR technology within the business activities of the KGHM Group. The target is to deploying a first NuScale Voygr SMR power plant in Poland as early as 2029. KGHM is investigating possible sites.",
            "KGHM wants to explore the deployment of SMR technology to repurpose or replace existing coal-fired power plants and provide electricity and heat for its industrial processes. KGHM is also looking more generally to diversify its energy sources. By 2030, 50% of the electricity used by KGHM will come from its own sources, including renewables. The Sierra Gorda mine in Chile is already powered by 100% with renewable energy.",
            "In July 2022, KGHM submitted an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency (NAEA) to evaluate NuScale's SMR technology and prepare a site study. Under a task order signed in September, NuScale will continue to support KGHM's application to the NAEA through activities including drafting additional preliminary safety analysis reports and coordinating with the NAEA. The task order also sets the stage for the subsequent tasks in the Early Works Agreement as proposed by NuScale. The VOYGR will have six modules, each with an installed capacity of 77 MWe. NuScale's SMR technology gained approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in August 2020."

            "Romainia’s nuclear utility SN Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN) says it put into operation its Feldioara Branch during January-March as part of its strategy for development of an integrated nuclear fuel cycle.",
            "SNN agreed in 2021 to purchase the uranium processing line assets of Compania Nationala a Uraniului (CNU) at Feldioara as part of a plan to develop a Romanian integrated fuel cycle. In December 2022, SNN acquired a concession to some assets from CNU as well as a property right on the land related to these assets from the Ministry of Energy. These assets were then leased to FPCU Feldioara (a subsidiary of SNN) for the operation and start-up of the production process. Between January and March 2023, all the necessary steps were taken to authorise the production process and prepare the facilities for the start operation.",
            "“The strategic decision to acquire part of Feldioara’s assets necessary for the processing of the raw material was aimed at preserving and developing the Romanian integrated nuclear fuel cycle, the integrated production capabilities in SNN,” said SNN Cosmin Ghita. It was also aimed at “ensuring the production of fuel assemblies and the optimal operation of NFP Pitesti and Cernavoda NPP, in the context of expanding the capacity of the nuclear power plant, at an advantageous transaction cost”. He added: “With investment projects worth €12bn for the upcoming decade, our purpose is to consolidate nuclear capabilities and provide Romania with full investment capacity.”",
            "At the same time, a subsequent contract was signed with Kazakhstan’s National Atomic Company, Kazatomprom, to provide the technological requirements for UO2 production. All the necessary steps were taken to transport the uranium concentrate and deliver the contracted quantities to ensure the start of production when the subsidiary was completed, SNN said.",
            "The transport was carried out using the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route under optimal conditions and in a very short period of time. SNN said acheiving this transport and the supply of uranium concentrates for the second time using this route confirmed that this option is a viable one and can be strengthened in the future. The Trans Caspian route was first developed in 2018 in case Kazatomprom's usual west-bound shipment route via St Petersburg became unavailable. It passes through Azerbaijan and Georgia and on to the Black Sea without entering Russian territory.",
            "Ghita also noted that the refurbishment of Cernavoda NPP unit 1 and the project to construct units 3&4, as well as development of small modular reactors in cooperation with US-based NuScale Power, would contribute to Romania’s energy stability, socio-economic development, the development of the nuclear industry and the training of a new generation of engineers. “The completion of these projects requires solid nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure and are all overarched by SNN’s mission to reenergise Romania with clean energy beyond the 2030s,” he said. The 700 MWe Cernavoda 1 was commissioned in December 1996 and Cernavoda 2 in 2007. Construction of three more units began, but was stopped in 1990. The Cernavoda 3&4 project aims to complete two further Candu 6 reactors. Cernavoda 1&2 supply 20% of Romania’s electricity.",
            "Kazatomprom confirmed that it had delivered uranium for Romania's NPP. Kazatomprom won the SNN open tender for the supply of uranium oxide to Romania's nuclear power industry in December 2022. Kazatomprom is the largest uranium producer in the world with natural uranium production totalling about 24% of the total global primary uranium production in 2021. The group has the largest uranium reserve base in the industry. Kazatomprom, together with subsidiaries, affiliates and joint organisations, is developing 26 deposits combined into 14 uranium mining enterprises. Kazatomprom’s main export markets are China, South and East Asia, North America and Europe.",

            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

The work was carried out under the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) voucher programme.",
            "Lightbridge is developing a new fuel design that incorporates an extruded metallic bar composed of a zirconium-uranium matrix within a zirconium alloy cladding. Lightbridge says this will: significantly increase fuel thermal conductivity (compared with ceramics) promoting lower operating temperatures; offer complete retention of fission products avoiding release of those products upon cladding failure; and support higher power and longer fuel cycles.",
            "The fuel is designed to work in both new and existing reactors. Lightbridge also claims that its fuel increases power output and extends the length of the fuel cycle and offers nuclear plants a better solution for load-follow operations on a grid with renewables.",
            "Working in collaboration with PNNL, the project scope was to demonstrate Lightbridge’s nuclear fuel casting process using depleted uranium, a key step in fuel manufacturing. Several castings were performed throughout the project, and the cast ingots were analysed. The casting methodology was gradually modified based on the characterisation results",
            "Lightbridge has long enjoyed support from DOE and various US national laboratories. In 2018, Lightbridge and France’s Framatome launched Enfission, a 50-50 joint venture (JV) company to develop, license and sell nuclear fuel assemblies. The previous year Lightbridge and Framatome (then Areva) had signed an agreement to set up a JV to develop, manufacture and commercialise Lightbridge’s advanced metallic fuel.",
            "In May 2019, Lightbridge Corporation announced that Framatome had received a voucher from the DOE GAIN programme to support development of Lightbridge fuel in collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory (INL). This was Framatome’s third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design conducted by the Enfission JV. Framatome said the voucher would enable it to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel.",

The initial phase of work aims to generate irradiation performance data for Lightbridge’s delta-phase uranium-zirconium alloy relating to various thermophysical properties. The data will support fuel performance modelling and regulatory licensing efforts for the commercial deployment of Lightbridge Fuel.",

The two sites in Dětmarovice and Tušimice are currently coal-fired power plants, which are being transformed for emission-free operation. As part of its Vision 2030, ČEZ Group is committed to preparing for the construction of SMRs with a total capacity of over 1,000 MWe after 2040.",
            "In addition to these first three SMR construction sites, ČEZ is exploring other locations. These include the Prunéřov, Ledvice, Poříčí and Mělník coal sites as well as the Dukovany NPP. However, initial analysis has already recommended that the Poříčí power plant location should not be further developed due to the almost certain presence of a nearby active fault near the site, which precludes the placement of nuclear technology.",
            "\"Small modular reactors are not a substitute for large nuclear units, but a complement to the energy mix of the Czech Republic as a suitable replacement for coal-fired power plants and large thermal power plants,” says Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ Board of Directors and Chief Renewables Officer. “The SMR construction programme represents a great opportunity for the Czech economy. It offers production of nuclear equipment, substantial involvement in the supply chain, and the creation of a regional service and training centre.”",
            "He added: “In order to take advantage of the opportunities of the SMR programme, action must be taken quickly. We expect that new nuclear sources, including SMRs, will also be significantly represented in the upcoming update of the State Energy Concept. This, in the long term, builds the Czech energy mix on a combination of nuclear and renewable sources.\"",
            "The Dětmarovice and Tušimice power plant sites will undergo further intensive exploration and monitoring before it is finally clear whether they are suitable locations for a nuclear power source. The exploration work, which began in the first half of February, is primarily focused on excluding the existence of active tectonic faults, assessing the hydrogeology of the area and analysing the bedrock. This phase should be completed by the autumn and others will then follow. ČEZ noted that the transformation of a non-nuclear site into a nuclear site requires a series of exploration activities lasting 3-5 years before the permit process can begin.",
            "The first SMR will be built near the Temelín NPP and should be completed before the new large nuclear unit is launched at the site, which is planned for 2040. ČEZ cooperates with the South Bohemian region and its subsidiary ÚJV Řež as part of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park, which covers research, development and preparation for construction. While the investor for the SMR has yet to be decided the site has been decided. The area is part of the wider Temelín NPP site, which has recently undergone a special seismic mission.",

        "text": [
            "Above: A local power range monitoring (LPRM) system measures neutron flux",
            "The emergence of the small modular reactor (SMR) sector is prompting capacity ramp ups across the supply chain as well as new designs for key equipment areas such as neutron detection. Reuter-Stokes, which has been designing and manufacturing neutron detection devices since the 1950s, is embracing these new opportunities.",
            "Rod Martinez, Reuter-Stokes Vice President, says: “in 1986 we became the OEM manufacturer of neutron sensors for boiling water reactors. Since then, we’ve been making neutron detectors for BWRs and PWRs and our company has expanded to not only provide neutron detection but auxiliary equipment. We’ve made the sensors that these companies need. With the emergence of SMR we’re helping these companies that are new names in the industry to design sensors too.”",
            "Reuter-Stokes has already made market in-roads, recently signing a contract with NuScale to design and manufacture unique neutron detectors for the company’s SMR design.",
            "Although currently the NuScale’s is the only SMR with design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Reuter-Stokes is clear in its ambition to become the go-to supplier for neutron detectors right across the SMR industry by leveraging the company’s experience. Daniel Schreiner, Nuclear Product Manager, for Reuter-Stokes, explains: “From a Reuter-Stokes perspective we want to work right across the sector. Our detectors are essentially reactor technology agnostic. They can work with any kind of reactor, just as long as it generates neutrons.”",
            "The first NuScale project to use the detectors, which are being developed in partnership with Paragon Energy Solutions, will be the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) in Idaho Falls, Idaho, which will see the first VOYGR SMR power plant installed. It is scheduled to begin generating power in 2029. Reuter-Stokes’ detector assemblies will be responsible for monitoring the fission rate while Paragon will develop the signal processing electronics and also the associated reactor protection system. “Our partnership with Paragon, where customers can realise our combined offering of detection technology and control system technology is unique,” says Martinez.",
            "For neutron detection, the major difference between large-scale boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs) is the physical location of the neutron detector. That location drives the geometry and the size.",
            "“For the boiling water reactor fleet our detectors are located inside the nuclear core right next to the fuel bundles. Since they’re very close to the fissioning fuel the detectors can be quite small. On a pressurized water reactor our detectors are located outside of the nuclear core, maybe one or two meters away so they see significantly less neutron flux. Therefore, the neutron detectors are substantially larger and could be up to, say, 40 inches (100 cm),” says Schreiner.",
            "For small modular reactors, companies are developing reactors based on both PWR and, less frequently, BWR technologies. “While the majority of the market is going the PWR route there are some boiling water reactors currently being designed,” says Martinez, adding: “Just about everything else is a pressurised water reactor, such as NuScale, Holtech and Rolls Royce but there’s also some others that are being developed. While they’re well understood and have been theoretically worked on for decades we’re getting to the point where we’re going to construct new fourth generation plants like high-temperature gas reactors or liquid metal reactors so there’s quite a bit of variation out there. Every one has their own pros and cons.”",
            "As Schreiner observes: “We would love to make just a generic detector that worked for everyone but what we’re seeing is that the different SMR developers are different enough that we are going to have to develop bespoke detector designs for each developer. A NuScale reactor detector design is not going to work for an X-Energy reactor detector design and so on. Each one of these reactors is different and is going to require a little bit of engineering work to custom fit our detectors to that specific technology. They’re potentially each going to need a separate design and qualification effort.” For example, on the large gigawatt-scale reactors all of the Reuter-Stokes detectors are of the fission chamber type. However, for small modular reactors, because of the differing technical parameters like temperature and neutron flux, it is possible to use ionization chambers in some instances as well. Because ionization chambers do not contain uranium they don’t require special nuclear material considerations that affect things like logistics regulations. That potentially is another benefit particularly associated with SMR technologies which are designed to be easily transported to site.",
            "Nonetheless, the challenge of new reactor designs new market entrants is picked up by Martinez, who says: “They’ve done a lot of research, but are now in a commercialization phase addressing the challenges and developing the sciences to deliver an SMR facility and all the benefits that brings. We are helping these companies design what they actually need for their particular reactor design from a sensor side with practical experience. We’re already well established and we can help to make the discovery phase and design phase a bit easier. Luckily, that’s one of our sweet spots.”",
            "Phased detector development",
            "To ease the design and qualification process, Reuter-Stokes has launched a three phase programme for SMR developers. “We’ve developed this phased process to try to help in terms of risk management and cost management,” says Schreiner. The problem is that SMR developers don’t always have all the answers when considering neutron detection. “We can’t go directly into detailed design without really understanding what the requirements are for these detectors, the technical specifications and the acceptance criteria for example,” Schreiner says. However, he adds: “Since we’ve been in business for so long, we do have a large catalogue. We have thousands of different detector designs that are both fission chamber-based",
            "and also ionization chamber types. When a new customer comes in and details the neutron flux, the temperature, and the sensitivity required our physicists can go into this database and find two or three detectors that are close. We can use that as the foundation for a custom product offering. We’re not starting from scratch with detailed engineering, we’re starting from maybe anywhere from the 60 to 80 percent complete phase.”",
            "This allows a two to six month front-end engineering effort to be launched – phase one preliminary design – working with the SMR developer and the SMR fuels engineer and talking directly to detector physicists to explore issues such as the location of the detector, what the environment looks like at that specific location and then which detectors from the catalogue could work for this application.",
            "“Once that process is complete now both sides have a really good understanding of what this technical specification looks like. Then the SMR developer can publish its technical specification and we’ll provide a fixed-term quote on phase two, which is detailed design and building a prototype detector to validate all of the physics models and manufacturing processes,” says Schreiner.",
            "Once phase two is complete the process can move to qualification with the relevant nuclear regulatory authorities. “It’s a very rigorous and methodical qualification process for a nuclear safety-related detector to ensure that the detector has been qualified for the safe operation start up and shut down of a nuclear reactor. It’s a huge investment both in design and time and in dollars to get that qualification. Reuter-Stokes’ experience of going through the qualification process helps when it comes to new designs and new types of sensors,” explains Schreiner. He concludes: “It’s mitigating risk and making sure that we control costs as we progress through the phases so that we’re constantly incorporating the lessons learned as we continue to work on the project with the customer”.",
            "The pressure is on all SMR developers to keep costs down as low as possible and Martinez makes a key observation: “The most important thing in terms of making things cheaper is you got to think about it early in the process. If we can have our detector physicists talking directly to the fuels engineer and they can work out where these detectors go before the SMR design is locked in that allows the widest range of detectors that we can choose from our off the shelf database.”",
            "It’s simple steps like this that will ensure the supply chain can support SMR development in making its ambitions a reality."

            "The MOU is the latest in a series of similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, SFI and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 SFI signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK.",
            "SFI Head of Strategy & Business Development for Clean Energy Dominic Ashmore said the latest MOU “complements a broader body of work that we are undertaking for the UK’s future civil nuclear programme” including SMRs, larger NPPs and fusion power. “We’ll work with Holtec to jointly develop the design for manufacture and purchase specifications for specific forgings, with specific attention on providing components which reduce the required machining, assembly, welding, and in-service inspection requirements for those components,” he added.",
            "Holtec plans to deploy a 5 GWe fleet of SMR-160s in the UK by 2050, with first operations planned for the early 2030s. \"We are delighted to partner with Sheffield Forgemasters to further manufacturing routes for key forgings required for this project,\" said Rick Springman, Senior Vice President of International Projects and Executive Committee member at Holtec.",

Government-owned Industria, as part of the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) Group, is leading efforts to develop a supply chain of parts and modules for SMR production. As a leader of Central Hydrogen Cluster, Industria aims to deploy up to three SMRs to produce 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen every year. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is a 470 MWe small pressurised water reactor, which the company aims to launch in the UK by 2030.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson said Poland is a key international market for its factory-built SMR. “This is an important step in our relationship with Industria, he said. It sets out “the basis on which we’ll work together to develop joint plans for using our SMR technology in Poland to decarbonise energy intensive industry and produce clean power for generations to come”.",
            "Poland and the wider region are seeking to decarbonise, while bolstering their energy security, Rolls-Royce SMR noted. It added that its factory-built power solution is perfectly sized to connect to the electricity grid or for off-grid industrial use such as hydrogen production. There are also future opportunities to replace more than 8GW of coal-fired power plants in southern Poland with SMRs throughout the 2030s.",
            "Industria CEO Szczepan Ruman said: “Participation in a supply chain of parts and modules for Rolls-Royce SMR is a great opportunity for our region and for entire industry in southern Poland.”",
            "Through the Central Hydrogen Cluster, “we cooperate with companies from our region as well as from three hydrogen valleys: Lower Silesia, Silesia-Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian”. He added that the initiative has the support of IDA Group with the aim of creating jobs and securing Polish industry’s strong participation in the SMR industry of the future. “Plans for deployment of Rolls-Royce SMR power plants in central and southern Poland will help meet these goals in the 2030s.”",
            "IDA Board President Cezariusz Lesisz said cooperation with Rolls-Royce SMR is a great opportunity to develop a high-tech industrial base for small scale nuclear power in Poland. “Building new competencies of Polish industry is part of a trend of focusing on energy transition and strengthening our country’s energy security and resilience.”",
            "Poland is focusing on nuclear energy as part of its decarbonisation plans and has selected US Westinghouse's AP1000 for the first part of its plan to build up to 9 GWe of nuclear capacity by 2040. Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power has agreed a separate plan to construct a NPP in Patnow with Polish companies ZE PAK and Polska Grupa Energetyczna. There are also other SMR projects underway.

        "text": [
            "Estonia's privately held nuclear energy company, Fermi Energia, has chosen GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's (GEH's) BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) for deployment in Estonia by the early 2030s.",
            "In 2022 Fermi Energia had accepted tenders from US-Japan joint venture GE Hitachi, US-based NuScale and the UK’s Rolls-Royce. Fermi Energia said the criteria for selection were technological maturity, establishment of a reference plant, economic competitiveness and participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain.",
            "Fermi Energia was founded by Estonian energy and nuclear energy professionals specifically to develop deployment of SMRs in Estonia. In July 2019, the company launched a feasibility study on the suitability of SMRs for Estonia's electricity supply and climate goals beyond 2030. This followed a financing round from investors and shareholders. At that time, four SMR designs were included in the feasibility study: Moltex Energy SSR-W300, Terrestrial Energy IMSR-400, GE Hitachi BWRX-300 and NuScale SMR.",
            "The BWRX-300 design is a 300 MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems. It is the 10th evolution of GE’s boiling water reactor (BWR), hence the “X” in its name. The design is based on the Generation III+ 1,520MWe ESBWR, which the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission certified in 2014. The BWRX-300 is currently undergoing a Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission Pre-licensing Vendor Design Review and a US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Pre-application design review.",
            "In January, GEH, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed a contract for the deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at OPG's Darlington site. In August 2022, the Tennessee Valley Authority began planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River Site in Tennessee. In June 2022, Canada's SaskPower selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan in the mid-2030s. In addition, Poland’s ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) plans a fleet of BWRX-300s, aiming to deploy the first by 2030. GEH has also begun the design certification process for the BWRX-300 in the UK.",
            "\"The BWRX-300 is a boiling water reactor based on its operating principle, which is used and well known by many European countries, including Finland and Sweden,” said Fermi Energia CEO Kalev Kallemets. “However, the specific reactor model is much smaller than the ones used in the nuclear plants of our northern neighbours, which allows for greater safety and reduced cost and time. At the same time, it is still possible to rely on the experience of our neighbours and to offer the consumer clean electricity at an affordable and stable price.\"",
            "He added: \"The choice of BWRX-300 by Polish, Swedish and other European companies gives assurance that the competence and supply chain of the selected technology will be sufficient in Europe.\"",
            "\"There are dozens of new SMRs in development around the world – each of them different in some way,” said Marti Jeltsov, Chief Technology Officer of Fermi Energia. “Some developers are experimenting with more exotic technologies that will take a long time to reach market maturity, while others use tried and tested, functional and safe solutions. Estonia cannot be too bold an experimenter with its first nuclear power plant. It also set a number of practical criteria for the choice of technology which, after thorough consideration, fell to GE Hitachi.\"",
            "GEH and Fermi Energia have worked together since signing an agreement in 2019 to collaborate on potential deployment applications for the BWRX-300. In 2021 this was followed by a teaming agreement to work together in key areas including licensing support and supply chain development. \"By leveraging a unique combination of existing fuel, plant simplifications, proven components and a design based on an already licensed reactor, the BWRX-300 offers cost-competitive zero-emission generation in a meaningful timeframe,\" said GEH President & CEO Jay Wileman.",
            "Before nuclear construction can begin in Estonia, a positive decision is required from the Riigikogu (parliament) as well as the initiation of a special national plan to find a suitable location for the plant and the development of nuclear energy legislation. \"We have analysed all the work ahead and consider it realistic to produce reliable, clean and affordable nuclear energy in Estonia by Christmas 2031, which should also be in the interest of society and the country's climate goals,” said Kallemets. “Understandably, this goal requires a serious effort from both the state and Fermi Energia.\"",

The universities include the AGH University of Science & Technology Stanisław Staszic in Krakow, Gdańsk University of Technology, Poznań University of Technology, Silesian University of Technology, Warsaw University of Technology, and Wrocław University of Technology. New training courses for nuclear specialists are to be established at these universities. Anna Moskwa, Minister of Climate & Environment also gave her support to the initiative, as did the European Commission’s newly established Copernicus Academy.",
            "Minister of Education & Science Przemysław Czarnek noted that talks about the need to launch and restore training in nuclear energy had been going on for some time. “New directions must be created, specialties must be revived, but also new directions of scientific research…. The world of science must follow business, must support business, must support entrepreneurship, must support the economy.”",
            "PKN President Orlen Daniel Obajtek said that energy transformation in Poland requires not only investment, but also well-educated staff. He stressed plans to establish the first small modular reactor (SMR) in Poland by 2028. “This is the time to act. We have an ambitious plan for 2038 for 76 SMRs at 26 locations.\" He added: “It will be the largest energy investment in Poland, but also in Europe. It will require tens of billions of euros.” The location for the reactors will be announced in the first half of this year. “We are already working on locations, we are investigating these locations,” he said. \"We can't just think about assets, but we also need to think about human capital. That is why Orlen's cooperation with universities is important.”",
            "He continued: “We must rely on Polish universities that have experience. Some of them can reactivate this experience, some have to build it again, but we have time for this.” He emphasised the need to create an energy mix that would ensure Poland's security. “I often see mistakes made in the past – research was undertaken but ended at the university and did not go further. And we must fix these mistakes. Science must serve business, and business must serve science.",
            "\"Small nuclear reactors are a technology that we decided to develop due to its energy efficiency and role in the process of achieving the company's emission neutrality by 2050,” he noted. “As a zero-emission source, SMR reactors will complement the portfolio of the most modern generation capacity of the Orlen Group. The development of specialised staff for this new energy sector is an important step in strengthening the Polish economy and national energy security.\"",
            "Dawid Jackiewicz, a Board member of ORLEN Synthos Green Energy, said: “The nuclear industry is a new, very promising branch of the economy. Given that one reactor will need over 100 highly qualified specialists, by 2040 we will need over 2,500 specialists….",
            "We are preparing to open the PG Nuclear Energy Centre.\" He added that the new agreement opens the way to reh revival of nuclear power. “It's about about developing a training programme and organising first and second cycle studies from the 2023/2024 academic year.” Chermical company Synthos Green and PKN Orlen earlier formed the joint venture Orlen Synthos Green Energy to build a fleet of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland, the first is planned to be launched by 2030.",
            "Professor Janusz Wojtkowiak from the Poznań University of Technology said each of the six universities is fully aware that the staff will need to be rebuilt. “People were active in the past, I mean during the first nuclear energy programme, but many years have passed. Some staff remained from the second [nuclear programme], which began in 2009 and ended in 2014. But every university sees the need to invest in its staff, support lecturers from abroad.”",

            "Developed with the aim of helping member states to better understand SMR technology, its safety and economic competitiveness, it provides a one-stop shop to access the IAEA’s full array of support and expertise. From technology development and deployment (including non-electric applications) to nuclear safety, security and safeguards, the platform uses as reference the IAEA Nuclear Energy Series publications, Technology Roadmap for Small Modular Reactor Deployment and other resources.",
            "While the technology’s safety and economic competitiveness must be fully demonstrated before SMRs can be more widely deployed, the SMR Platform has developed a medium-term strategy aimed at providing support to governments, operators, industry and regulators to address these and related challenges.",
            "“The Platform is a very powerful interdepartmental mechanism, bringing together expertise from across the organisation on SMRs,” said Stefano Monti, Chair of the Platform Implementation Team and Head of the IAEA’s Nuclear Power Technology Development Section.",
            "More than 80 SMR designs are under development in 19 countries and the first SMR units are already in operation in China and Russia. As a result, SMRs, including microreactors (MRs), are expected to play an increasingly important role in helping to ensure energy security as well as supporting the transition to net zero emissions. The technologies thus provide a unique potential to address some of our most pressing challenges, from climate change to sustainable development.",
            "“SMRs are perhaps the most exciting and most watched emerging technology in nuclear power today,” Mikhail Chudakov, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy, said at the meeting, which took place in September. “Member States from Africa and the Americas to Asia and Europe are developing or interested in deploying SMRs, and in a variety of ways, the IAEA Platform on SMRs and their electric and non-electric applications is helping them to do this effectively, safely and securely,” he added.",
            "Participants at the meeting were given an overview of the latest updates on the Platform, as well as IAEA’s Medium-Term Strategy for SMRs and on the related Nuclear Harmonisation and Standardisation Initiative. Two new publications were also launched, which will provide countries considering SMRs with additional tools.",
            "Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments is a supplement to the IAEA’s Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS) that can help countries to identify reactor designs that suit their needs. It provides the latest data and information on SMRs from around the world, including detailed descriptions of almost all SMRs under development or construction worldwide.",
            "Meanwhile, Small Modular Reactors: A New Nuclear Energy Paradigm “addresses the needs of policy makers and relevant stakeholders, covering not only SMR technology and applications but the entire full cycle, including infrastructure and economics,” said Monti.",
            "“The activities pertaining to the safety and security of SMRs are a priority for the Agency,” said Anna Bradford, Director of the IAEA Division of Nuclear Installation Safety. “Particularly, our focus is to ensure that the important innovations introduced by SMRs are fully considered and consistent with current safety, security and regulatory approaches. These activities are well coordinated with all other important aspects of the work of the Agency considered as part of the SMR platform.” The IAEA",
            "expects to publish a Safety Report on the applicability of IAEA safety standards to SMR technologies by the end of 2022.",
            "Earlier this year the SMR Platform introduced a new web portal, which covers technology development and deployment (including non-electric applications), nuclear safety, security and safeguards as well as fuel, the fuel cycle and waste management. The portal will be expanded to incorporate additional features such as areas for technical working groups, information on national and international SMR projects and programmes. “The portal is designed to serve as a centralised source of information for both external and internal IAEA stakeholders, with different levels of information and data access,” said Monti.",
            "“The IAEA is undertaking important activities on the safety and security of SMRs. For example, we have recently completed the review of applicability of the safety standards to SMRs and other technologies,” said Paula Calle Vives, Senior Nuclear Safety Officer at the IAEA coordinating SMR safety activities. “We have also developed a programme of work to progressively adjust the safety standards so that they better capture the specificities of these new technologies. The Platform portal will enable us to better disseminate this work to member states.”",
            "Some countries are already receiving assistance through the SMR Platform and several cross-cutting task forces have been established to address their needs. One of these is helping to organise an expert mission to Jordan to analyse the economics of using SMRs for electricity generation and water desalination. The IAEA is also supporting Brazil in analysing SMR technologies and market readiness, regulatory issues, and requirements for SMR siting.",
            "“Amid the energy and climate crises, more and more countries are looking at SMRs as an option to improve energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions,” Monti said. “The IAEA can help them on this journey, which can begin with a visit to the new portal of the IAEA SMR Platform and then, if desired, by lodging a formal request for Agency assistance.”",
            "Nuclear harmonisation and standardisation",
            "SMRs also feature in the IAEA’s new Nuclear Harmonisation and Standardisation Initiative (NHSI), which held its kick off meeting in June 2022. NHSI is helping to facilitate the deployment of safe and secure SMRs by bringing together policymakers, regulators, designers, vendors and operators to develop common regulatory and industrial approaches to SMRs. The many SMR designs under development worldwide, including innovative reactors that are yet to be licensed and novel methods of modular manufacturing that are new to the nuclear industry, means that deployment of SMRs in time to address climate change is a difficult and complex task.",
            "The plans to establish NHSI were announced earlier in 2022 by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi, who said IAEA aims to facilitate the safe and secure deployment of SMRs and other advanced nuclear technologies to maximise their contribution to achieving the goals of Agenda 2030 and the Paris Agreement, including reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. “SMRs and other advanced nuclear technologies hold immense promise to help address the climate crisis,” ne noted. “But if countries are to fully benefit from their potential to significantly reduce emissions and provide reliable energy, then some challenges to global deployment must be addressed. That’s what this new initiative is all about.”",
            "The cost advantage of SMRs in part arise from an understanding that prefabricated modules could be produced in factories and assembled on site. However, for this to work across borders, common industrial standards, codes and licensing requirements are needed, so that the same safety standards could apply regardless of the country of installation. A degree of harmony among different national nuclear regulatory approaches will also be necessary.",
            "“On the regulatory side, the aim is to increase regulatory collaboration, to establish common positions on technical and policy issues, to pave the way to greater harmonisation, initially in the pre-licensing phase for SMRs, with an agreed expectation of high levels of safety and security for these advanced designs,” said Lydie Evrard, IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security.",
            "Under the NHSI, IAEA will bring together decision makers from governments, regulators, designers, technology holders, operators and other international organisations under two separate complementary tracks: one for technology holders and operators and another for regulators. These tracks, facilitated by the Agency, will then join up in 2024 under an IAEA framework to further advance the initiative, culminating in roadmaps with concrete action plans.",
            "“For industry, the initiative will seek to provide a list of concrete actions and milestones for technology holders and operators to develop more standardised industrial approaches for design, manufacturing, construction, commissioning and operation of SMRs as well as generic user requirements and criteria,” said Aline des Cloizeaux, Director of the IAEA Division of Nuclear Power.",
            "Even before these recent development, IAEA had intensified its work in providing support to member states in the development and licensing of SMRs. IAEA is also reviewing the applicability of IAEA Safety Standards to SMRs and has supported, since 2015, the SMR Regulators’ Forum, in which national regulators discuss approaches to this new technology. In addition, IAEA has completed the review of over 60 safety standards to guide their application to a range of SMRs and innovative technology lifecycles and recently published a new TECDOC – “Approach and Methodology for the Development of Regulatory Safety Requirements for the Design of Advanced Nuclear Power Reactors – Case Study on Small Modular Reactors”.",
            "It proposes a stepwise, technology neutral approach and methodology for the development and adaption of regulatory safety requirements for the design of advanced nuclear power reactor technologies, with a particular focus on SMRs. It aims to support decision making by national regulatory authorities, and is based on integrated risk-informed, objective-oriented, performance-based approaches. The publication identifies and exemplifies the key design features of SMRs to be considered important for the process of development or updating the regulatory safety requirements. The information presented is based on the experience provided by technical experts from member states with experience of regulatory requirements for advanced nuclear power reactor technologies, and particularly for SMR designs.",

It was connected to the grid in December 2019, and at the end of May 2020 began commercial operation. The FNPP comprises a dedicated system of coastal infrastructure to support the Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit, which is equipped with two KLT-40S pressurised water reactors (PWRs), previously used to power icebreakers, with capacity of 35MWe each. The power capacity of the FNPP is 70MW, the heat capacity is 50 Gcal/h. Russian regulator Rostekhnadzor has issued a 10-year licence to nuclear utility Rosenergoatom to operate the Akademik Lomonosov until 2029. It was the lead project of a series of mobile transportable low power units to be sited in the Far North and the Far East to provide energy to remote industrial enterprises, port cities and gas and oil platforms.",
            "Subsequent units will have upgraded larger RITM-200 reactors each with a capacity of 50MWe. China (under contract to Russia) has begun laying the keel of the hull for the first of these upgraded FNPPs. It is due to be delivered to Russia by the end of 2023 for the completion and installation of the reactors and other equipment, which is already being manufactured by Russia’s Atomenergomash. This is the first of four planned FNPP units intended for operation in the waters of Cape Nagleingyn in Chukotka. Russia is also planning to construct a ground-based SMR in Yakutia using an adapted version of the RITM-200. The plant is scheduled to be launched in 2028.",

            "Both 250MWt reactors reactors have achieved criticality and will drive a single 210MWe turbine. High-temperature gas-cooled reactors use graphite as a moderator and helium as a coolant. The uranium fuel comprises 6 cm-diameter pebbles, each with an outer layer of graphite and containing some 12,000 four-layer ceramic-coated fuel particles dispersed in a matrix of graphite powder. The HTR-PM follows on from China’s HTR-10, a 10 MWt high-temperature gas-cooled experimental reactor at Tsinghua University’s Institute of Nuclear & New Energy Technology, which started up in 2000 and reached full power in 2003. A further 18 such HTR-PM units are proposed for the Shidaowan site.",

As well as relying on passive safety systems, Carem’s entire primary coolant system is contained within the single self-pressurised vessel and uses free convection to circulate the coolant. This eliminates the need for devices such as pumps within the primary circuit and decreases the extent and complexity of the piping system required, as well as reduces the possibility of accidents involving a loss of coolant.",
            "Before work was suspended in 2017, it was in line to be the world’s first operating SMR. The government licensed it as a prototype in 2009. Development started in 1980 by the National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) and technology company INVAP and it was first announced in 1984. Progress slowed in the early 2000s but a 2006 government decree made the Carem25 programme a national priority. A second executive order in 2008 made the project directly responsible to the President of Argentina. Initially, Carem25 was expected to start up in 2017, but work was suspended in face of financial and technical problems. However work resumed in 2020.",

Instead, the combined licence application and NRC’s safety review would address any remaining safety and environmental issues for the proposed nuclear power plant.

            "In another first, an IAEA team of experts in August concluded a safety review of Romania’s process for selecting the site for a planned SMR, which it hopes could become the first SMR built in Europe. In May, the Romanian Government, through state company Societatea Nationala Nuclearelectrica SA (SNN), announced that it had chosen Doicesti, approximately 90 km northwest of the capital Bucharest, as the preferred site for the SMR, following an in-depth study conducted with a United States Trade and Development Agency grant. Romania is considering construction of a NuScale SMR.",
            "Romania requested the IAEA to conduct a Site and External Events Design (SEED) review mission to assess the process that was followed in choosing the preferred site. This was the first ever IAEA SEED mission to look into site selection for an SMR.",
            "Romania documented the site selection process in a preliminary SNN report, which will be followed by a preliminary Front-End Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The SEED mission said a limited amount of additional work is needed on sensitivity analysis and collection of confirmatory data for the FEED study, together with detailed recommendations on the minimisation of project risks. The team provided some recommendations to support the optimisation of the site selection process and to minimise the risk that the following phases will identify important safety issues that may affect project implementation. In particular, the IAEA team recommended that:",
            "All data be collected in a site selection summary report, according to the recommendations issued in IAEA Safety Guide SSG-35, to provide traceable support for later decisions and site evaluation phases.",
            "A suitable graded approach be applied for the specific technology selected for the SMR to be deployed, and in accordance with the potential radiological consequences of accidents, to meet overall safety objectives. Guidelines on the IAEA approach to grading were provided.",
            "A possible additional data collection phase for the selection process — through light investigation and monitoring — be implemented for the preferred site, as back-up solutions, focused on the most discriminating selection criteria.",
            "“We invited the IAEA SEED mission because it is a priority for us to build in Romania a state-of-the-art SMR project, in full compliance with the highest safety standards,” said Cosmin Ghita, SNN CEO. “With the continued support of the IAEA, our experience in siting and building our first SMR can be used by other countries considering building SMRs. SNN is ready to share our experience on strategic and technical aspects of SMR deployment projects.”",
            "IAEA’s support for SMR development and deployment will clearly be vital as more countries decide to adopt this new technology. The SEED mission shows that this support already goes beyond providing technical advice and organising discussion fora and consultations to undertaking practical activities. It is already playing an essential role in developing the detailed technical data, regulations and safety standards, which will be needed in the coming years.",

        "title": "US Professor Thane Gustafson: Russia’s nuclear industry is unique",
        "text": [
            "As the Western nuclear industry flounders, Russia’s Rosatom is building nuclear power plants (NPPs) on time and under budget around the world, while selling uranium to the US, according to Professor Thane Gustafson. His article, on “The Devil’s Dance” substack blog, says Russia has world-beating nuclear power technology that is flourishing thanks to booming exports. The article, originally released in May, has now been reproduced in several other publications and a link provided on Gustafson’s Twitter page.",
            "Gustafson is a professor of political science at Georgetown University, Washington DC, specialising in comparative politics and the political history of Russia and the former USSR. He is a former professor at Harvard, a former analyst for Rand Corporation and Senior Director of Russian and Caspian Energy for IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates. He has published seven books on Russian affairs.",
            "He notes that nuclear power in the West, which has been “in the doghouse” for 40 years, is now taking a second look at the technology in face of concerns about global warming. “There is a problem, though: after decades of neglect, the Western nuclear industry has lost much of its capability to build new NPPs or even (in the case of France) to maintain them, as skilled workers and experienced managers have left or retired,” he says. “In the US, no new NPPs have been commissioned in the past three decades (although one is due to start up soon, but fifteen years late). At this time of writing, none of the traditional leaders still active in civilian nuclear power is able to execute a nuclear project on time or even close to budget.”",
            "By contrast, “The Russian nuclear industry stands out as a rare – indeed unique – case of a high-technology sector that has not only recovered from the end of the Soviet era and the chaos that followed, but has developed an effective export strategy that has allowed it to prosper today as never before.”",
            "He contends that Russia’s nuclear industry is thriving, thanks mainly to its international business. He cites its success in exporting NPPs including a “full service” package that covers construction and operation, as well as the supply and reprocessing of nuclear fuel. “The Russian government actively supports Rosatom with low-interest financing. In short, Russian nuclear power is on a roll.” In addition, Rosatom exports enriched uranium to numerous countries, including the US and Europe and also provides services to five EU counties that operate Russian-built NPPs.",
            "“Because of this dependence, Russia’s nuclear industry is not under Western sanctions …. Rosatom is able to operate without impediment, both at home and abroad; one of the few sectors in the Russian economy to be able to do so,” he notes. “For both the US and Europe the implications are serious. First, they will continue to depend on Russian enriched uranium for several years more, potentially weakening their common front on sanctions.”",
            "He adds: “Secondly, and more fundamentally, neither the US nuclear industry nor its European counterparts, in their present decrepit state, is in any position to compete commercially with the Russians in the construction of new NPPs, whether at home or in the developing world. Russia should continue to hold a commanding position in nuclear power for some time to come.”",
            "Gustafson points out that the US, in particular, relies on Russia for low-enrichment uranium for its own NPPs. “Although efforts are under way to develop substitutes, for the present Rosatom is simply too valuable to sanction.”",
            "[NEI: The EU is currently developing its 10",
            "round of sanctions on Russia, which are expected to include Rosatom and the nuclear industry, although the US is not, as yet, considering such a move]",
            "“But even if sanctions were to be imposed, Rosatom’s operations would be largely unaffected,” he states. “Internally, its supply chain, which … runs from uranium mining to power plant construction and operation, depends very little on the outside. As a direct descendant of the Soviet nuclear programme, it was designed from the beginning to be self-contained, with a minimum of reliance on imported designs and components. That remains the case today. Indeed, as Russia’s leading high-tech company, Rosatom is increasingly being given the mission of filling sanctions-related gaps in other Russian industries.”",
            "Gustafson indicates that. Apart from sanctions Russia could face two other challenges – technological progress and possible competition from China. He notes that Western countries, to deal with the high costs and long approval times of large traditional power plants are encouraging the development of small modular reactors (SMR) which “could be one of the keys to tomorrow’s nuclear renaissance, especially in developing countries, Russia’s main market”.",
            "However, he notes that “Russia would be well positioned” as “the only country in the world to operate nuclear-powered icebreakers and floating NPPs, both of which are powered by small reactors”. Russian experience in designing and building small reactors “goes back decades to the Soviet era, and there have been multiple generations of successively improved designs”. Rosatom is working on deploying them not only on nuclear icebreakers and floating platforms, but also on land. “A small NPP is already planned in Yakutia, in Russia’s Far East, and Rosatom has also signed an agreement with Kyrgyzstan to explore the deployment of small reactors there,” he says.",
            "In contrast, “Western countries lag far behind in SMR development and deployment. The first SMRs will continue to be based on conventional light-water technology, but they are still far from deployment. For example, US-based NuScale just submitted to the NRC the Standard Design Approval application for its VOYGR SMR …. But the first units will be ready only by around 2030, according to company estimates, even assuming the absence of delays in regulatory approval and construction.”",
            "The more proximate threat to Rosatom’s leading position is Beijing, he suggests. China has a vigorous nuclear programme, which is entirely independent of Russia. China ranks first in the world in the number of units under construction, and it is moving quickly toward next-generation designs. China’s first Gen IV reactor just reached full power last month. It uses a modular design, with each module having 100 MWe of output.” He adds that “neither Russia nor any Western country has anything similar at a comparably advanced stage of deployment”.",
            "[NEI: He is referring to China’s HTR-PM high temperature gas cooled reactor. However, while China is certainly developing its own nuclear technology, Russia has played and continues to play, a key role in the development of its nuclear industry. China’s 600MWe fast neutron reactor is being developed with Russian assistance after Russia previously helped to build, and provides fuel for, its prototype Chinese Experimental Fast Reactor. Russia also helped to build China’s uranium enrichment plant at Hanzhun/Hanzhong, and has provided its VVER technology for units 1-4 at the Tianwan NPP as well as for units 7&8 under construction and units 3&4 under construction at the Xudabao NPP.]",
            "Gustafson concludes: “Despite these risks, Rosatom and the Russian civilian nuclear industry look likely to retain their leading role for at least another decade. The challenges ahead are real, but they will come more from technological changes and rising competition from China, than from sanctions.”"

            "A new budget plan has been approved for deployment of US NuScale Power’s small modular reactor (SMR) technology as part of the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP). The Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) launched the CFPP in 2015 as part of its long-term strategy to reduce carbon emissions and replace ageing coal-fired plants with a carbon-free fuel, and small-to-full-sized, flexible power generating source.",
            "The Project Management Committee (PMC) for the CFPP) has now reaffirmed its commitment to NuScale’s SMR technology by approving a new Budget and Plan of Finance (BPF) and an update to the Development Cost Reimbursement Agreement (DCRA). The project calls for constructing a NuScale SMR at the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site.",
            "UAMPS, a consortium of 48 public power utilities with service areas in eight western states, is currently active on the CFPP site performing site characterisation activities. In January 2021, UAMPS and NuScale executed agreements to help manage and de-risk the development of the CFPP. Pursuant to initial orders from UAMPS, Fluor Corporation and NuScale (as a subcontractor to Fluor) agreed to develop higher maturity cost estimates and initial project planning work for the licensing, manufacturing, and construction of the CFPP. These agreements sere seen as an important step in a deployment plan that was expected to result in an order for NuScale modules by UAMPS in 2022.",
            "The NuScale Power Module (NPM), a small, 77 MWe pressurised water reactor that can be scaled to meet customer needs. The NPM is the only SMR design to receive US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approval. NRC issued a Final Safety Evaluation Report for the design in September 2020 after which NuScale announced an increase in capacity of the design to 77 MWe from the previously envisaged 60 MWe. NuScale has now submitted an application for Standard Design Approval of the updated design, based on a six-module plant configuration.",
            "The CFPP is expected to comprise several modules. UAMPS says it is still evaluating options for power plant size, including the 4-pack, 6-pack, 8-pack or 12-pack module configurations, to ensure the best overall cost of energy to meet energy needs of its members. According to UAMPS, the CFPP will enable its members to add significantly higher amounts of intermittent renewable energy, especially wind and solar, to energy portfolios. “The CFPP, combined with renewables, will enable many members to completely decarbonise their energy portfolios,” it notes.",
            "NuSale says the BFP approval is a “key milestone” that was reached with the receipt and acceptance of the CFPP’s Class 3 Project Cost Estimate (PCE), which further refines the anticipated total cost of the project. As part of the PCE, NuScale worked with its UAMPS partners to update the BPF, which is designed to manage and reduce risk to CFPP participants. The BPF provides UAMPS with an option to withdraw from the project and be reimbursed for most out-of-pocket expenses if the CFPP’s price of energy per MWh exceeds a certain threshold. The new DCRA that was approved by the PMC also establishes an updated target price of $89 per MWh, “which reflects the changing financial landscape for the development of energy projects nationwide”. NuScale and the CFPP have yet to execute the amendment to the DCRA adopting the new price target.",
            "The Class 3 PCE determined that the cost of the CFPP has been influenced by external factors such as inflationary pressures and increases in the price of steel, electrical equipment and other construction commodities not seen for more than 40 years. These inflationary pressures are increasing the costs for all power generation and infrastructure projects, NuScale notes.",
            "CFPP Project Director Shawn Hughes in December provided an update of development of the Combined Operating Licence Application (COLA) for the project – the largest CFPP task currently underway. He said delivery of the COLA to NRC is scheduled for January 2024. COLA section reviews are slightly behind schedule, but will be brought up to date over the next several months. The three parts of the COLA total many volumes, he noted. The safety analysis report and environmental sections will be very comprehensive. Formal and informal interactions are underway with NRC."

The previous year Lightbridge and Framatome (then Areva) had signed an agreement to set up a JV to develop, manufacture and commercialise Lightbridge’s advanced metallic fuel. In May 2019, Lightbridge Corporation announced that Framatome had received a voucher from the DOE’s Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) programme to support the development of Lightbridge Fuel in collaboration with the INL.",
            "This was Framatome’s third GAIN voucher and its first supporting the Lightbridge Fuel design conducted by the Enfission JV. Framatome said the voucher would enable it to apply focused attention on key licensing steps to commercialise Lightbridge Fuel. The voucher was valued at $477,000 for work to be carried out over 12 months.",
            "In April 2020, Lightbridge entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), the operator of INL, to design an experiment for irradiation of metallic fuel material in the ATR. That agreement was valued at $845,000, with DOE funding three-quarters of this the GAIN programme. Lightbridge and INL were to establish the test plan for measuring key thermo-physical properties of Lightbridge Fuel material both before and after irradiation in the ATR.",
            "The following year, in March 2021, Lightbridge and France’s Framatome terminated their Enfission joint venture. In July 2021 announced a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the Battelle Memorial Institute, Pacific Northwest Division, the operating contractor of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with the DOE. The goal of this agreement was to advance a critical stage in the manufacturing process of Lightbridge Fuel by demonstrating a casting process using depleted uranium-zirconium material. The total project value of the CRADA was approximately $663,000, with three-quarters of this funded by DOE for the scope performed by PNNL.",
            "In June 2022, Lightbridge announced that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had been awarded approximately $800,000 by DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program R&D Awards to study the deployment of Accident Tolerant Fuels (ATF) in Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). The project, funded entirely by DOE, would include simulation of the fuel and safety performance of Lightbridge Fuel inside a SMR designed by NuScale Power.",
            "Lightbridge is developing a new fuel design that incorporates an extruded metallic bar composed of a zirconium-uranium matrix within a zirconium alloy cladding. Lightbridge says this will: significantly increase fuel thermal conductivity (compared with ceramics) promoting lower operating temperatures; offer complete retention of fission products avoiding release of those products upon cladding failure; and support higher power and longer fuel cycles.",
            "The fuel is designed to work in both new and existing ($20+ billion market) reactors. Lightbridge also claims that its fuel increases power output and extends the length of the fuel cycle and offers nuclear plants a better solution for load-follow operations on a grid with renewables.",
            "INL’s nuclear research capabilities rely heavily on the ATR, located at the ATR Complex on the INL Site near Idaho Falls. Numerous upgrades and improvements have been done since ATR entered service in 1967. ATR is a one-of-a-kind pressurised water test reactor that operates at very low pressures and temperatures compared with a large commercial nuclear power plant. The main product of a test reactor is neutrons rather than heat. ATR uses a beryllium reflector to help concentrate neutrons in the core, where they are needed for fuels and materials testing. ATR employs a unique design in which key internal components can be completely replaced during a core overhaul (Core Internals Changeout) every 10 years on average to enable long-term operations. The sixth core overhaul took place during 2021-2022.",

            "NuScale has announced that the US NRC Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) has issued letter ML22287A155, concurring with NRC staff, stating that the NuScale methodology for determining the appropriate size of the Emergency Planning Zone (EPZ) acceptable for use by NuScale small modular reactor (SMR) power plants. This methodology will determine an EPZ that provides the same level of protection to the public as the 10 mile radius EPZs used for existing US NPPs, and is approved only for the NuScale SMR design, further demonstrating NuScale’s unparalleled safety.",
            "The EPZ is the area surrounding a plant, where special considerations and management practices are pre-planned and exercised in case of an emergency. Using this method, an EPZ that is limited to the site boundary of the plant is achievable for a wide range of potential plant sites where a NuScale VOYGR SMR power plant could be located, NuScale said. “The significance of a NuScale plant with an EPZ limited to the site boundary is the NuScale plant can better accommodate siting of process heat off-takers, businesses, and housing in close proximity, and significantly reduces ownership costs to facilitate a plant’s emergency plan.”",
            "The NuScale Power Module (NPM) is a small pressurised water reactor that can generate 77MWe and can be scaled to meet customer needs. NuScale’s 12-module VOYGR-12 power plant is capable of generating 924MWe, and NuScale also offers four-module VOYGR-4 (308MWe) and six-module VOYGR-6 (462MWe) power plants, as well as other configurations based on customer needs.",
            "In its summary, NRC says: “The NuScale EPZ methodology is risk-informed, provides a technically consistent approach … for EPZ sizing, and adequately considers seismic and multi-module impacts. The staff’s safety evaluation approves this NuScale methodology with several conditions of use.” NRC adds: “As noted in our final letter on the NuScale design certification application, there are several potentially risk-significant items that were not completed at the time of the design certification application approval. We expect an evaluation of the potential impact of these items to be included in any future staff review.”",
            "NRC also notes that justifying a small EPZ will be different for non-light water reactors with little or no operating experience or sound estimates of the frequency of severe accidents. “The uncertainty in severe accidents (e.g., external events) must be balanced against expected lower source terms and the passive and inherent safety features of the design. Engineering judgement may have to replace mechanistic analytic calculations in establishing the relevant accident phenomenology and system response.”",

            "Romanian nuclear utility Compania Națională Nuclearelectrica (SNN) and Romanian private company Nova Power & Gas have launched RoPower Nuclear – a project company for development of small modular reactors (SMRs) in Romania – on the site of the former coal-fired power plant in Doicesti, Dambovita County. Jose W Fernandez, US Under Secretary for Economic Growth, Energy and Environment, US Department of State, and Romanian Minister of Energy Virgil Popescu observed the signing ceremony of the Shareholders Declaration, at Romania’s Ministry of Energy.",
            "RoPower Nuclear will take steps towards deploying the first NuScale VOYGR-6 (462MWe) power plant in Romania this decade. The power plant will use the NuScale Power Module technology of NuScale, the only SMR company so far to obtained design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The installed capacity can also be supplemented with renewables amounting to a capacity of around 80MWe, which would make the new energy complex exceed the capacity of the former Doicesti plant. The joint nuclear-renewable solution would represent not only an optimal production capacity, with the ability to vary output, but also a vision of the generation sources for the power grid of the future.",
            "“We are proud that we will develop in Romania a safe power plant that offers clean and cost-effective energy, bringing at the same time multiple benefits for the local community,” said SNN CEO Cosmin Ghita. “With energy independence and energy security as the highest objectives, Romania will be a leader for the deployment of small modular reactors in the region and the new company, RoPower Nuclear an example of best practices in implementing the highest nuclear safety standards, performance, and productivity, following the example set by Cernavoda NPP for more than 25 years.”",
            "Teodor Chirica, President of the SNN Board, added: “The long cooperation between the United States and Romania in the nuclear field has a very successful track record. Thus, I am firmly convinced that the RoPower Nuclear will have an excellent cooperation with both the US nuclear industry and Romanian industry, under the frame of the USA-Romania strategic partnership, providing clean energy and security of supply for our country and the region.”",
            "SNN operates under the authority of the Romanian Ministry of Energy, with the state owning 82.49% of the shares and other shareholders, 17.50. The Cernavodă NPP operates two Candu nuclear units, which contribute more than 18% of total energy production.",
            "The US-Romania partnership has developed significantly since 2019, when SNN and NuScale signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to evaluate the development, authorisation and construction of SMRs in Romania. In 2020, Romania signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the USA on nuclear energy, which was also ratified by the Romanian Parliament, while US Exim Bank concluded a MOU with Romania’s Ministry of Energy on energy investment projects in Romania totalling $7 billion. In 2021 NuScale and SNN signed a collaboration agreement to accelerate the implementation of the first SMR in Europe. Nuclearelectrica received $1.2 million in funding from the USTDA to identify and evaluate potential sites for SMRs.",
            "Earlier in 2022, several suitable potential sites were identified and the former thermal power plant in Doicești qualified as a candidate site for further in-depth studies and development. In May Nuclearelectrica, NuScale and E-Infra (the owner of the site) signed a MOU to analyse the development of the first SMR in Doicești.",
            "In June, US President Joe Biden allocated a $14 million grant for the next stage of NuScale SMR development in Romania – the preliminary engineering and initial design (FEED) study for the project. Within the FEED Study, IAEA recommendations will be applied, following the IAEA Site Design and External Events (SEED) mission carried out in August 2022, at the request of SNN.",

        "title": "Czech Republic’s first SMR could be built at Temelín by 2032",
        "text": [
            "A small modular reactor (SMR) could be built in the Czech Republic at the Temelín NPP as early as 2032, Daniel Beneš, the Director of the ČEZ power group has said after signing a contract for the establishment of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park. South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba, addressing an international conference, said: \"We realise that nuclear energy is something that we fundamentally need in the republic. \"Czech industry is not only driven by renewable sources, we are not Norway, which has unlimited water capacities and produces 95% of its energy with clean hydropower plants.\"",
            "This is why it was decided to establish the South Bohemian Energy Park, using the Temelin site to build the first SMR in Europe, including an educational centre for engineers, specialists and other technical professions, he added. \"We thus have a unique opportunity to participate in the construction and development of a technical background where experts from all over Europe can be educated.\"",
            "The joint company South Bohemia Nuclear Park aims to facilitate construction of the first pilot project at Temelín which offers a protected, research space, and the presence of professional staff to ensure a synergistic effect during planning, construction and operation.",
            "This project has the support of the government, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. \"In the context of the situation in Europe, the signing of this agreement is an extremely important step. This is a landmark year, the war in Ukraine shook the international order, tested allied relations and showed the danger of dependence on resources and raw materials from risky countries,\" he noted",
            "\"Due to supply cuts, we are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of electricity and gas, a situation that threatens us and with which we must deal quickly,” he said. “The government is reacting to it with acute measures, but this is not enough, and that is why we are also working on longer-term solutions that will strengthen our energy security and independence,\" he explained, adding that it also involves building a SMR. \"These are smaller mass-produced devices that largely overcome some of the disadvantages of existing reactors. They could replace ageing power plants and heating plants,\" he concluded.",
            "Beneš emphasised that Temelin is the best possible place for the pilot project. \"At the same time, preparation for the construction of two new standard units continues. We are also working on the project of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany NPP, where we expect offers by the end of November. These buildings are not in competition with the small modular reactors we are talking about.\" He added that SMRs are complementary technologies and are more suitable for a range of different locations. \"Everything is based on the energy mix, the Czech energy mix largely relies on nuclear energy.\"",
            "In the last year, the ČEZ Group has accelerated activities related to the SMR project, having already signed memorandums of cooperation with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, KHNP and Holtec. Through its subsidiary ÚJV Řež, it is also developing SMRs locally. The HeFASTo project or the Energywell project are at an advanced stage of research and intensive cooperation is also underway with Westinghouse.",
            "\"There are seven companies in the world that deal with the preparation of such projects. We are in very active communication with all of them, we have signed memoranda of cooperation with them. They should put the first installations into operation before 2030. We have a feeling that these technologies will be ground-breaking. It makes sense to build the first pilot project next to the Temelín cooling towers.” He noted that some SMRs are almost as big as the nuclear units in Dukovany, but they are easier and faster to build than large nuclear reactors. He said the SMR in Temelín could be ready between 2032 and 2035.",
            "\"Given the current situation, we are accelerating this project. We see that it will be necessary to replace a number of coal-fired power plants and heating plants, while maintaining the maximum degree of self-sufficiency,” said Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear energy division. “SMRs are a safe and very efficient option from this point of view. \"",
            "The South Bohemian Nuclear Park is a joint project of all parties involved, covering research, development, communication and preparation of the building itself. However, an investor for the SMR has not been decided and investment costs have not yet been estimated.",

Bids with comprehensive technical documentation needed to estimate the construction cost are expected by December, and the technology selection will be made in February 2023.",
            "Fermi Energia's international partners and shareholders helped prepare the detailed call for tenders. In the selection of technology, the criteria are technological maturity, the establishment of a reference station, economic competitiveness and the participation of Estonian companies in the supply chain. The winner will sign a project development and preliminary works contract.",
            "\"We started selecting the technology already in 2019, at that moment mapping all the companies developing new nuclear technologies, of which there were several dozen in the world at that time,” explained Kalev Kallemets, head of Fermi Energia. Some of them have turned out to be more successful, and from the successful ones, in turn, we have to choose the most suitable for Estonian conditions and the electricity system, taking into account the final price of the produced electricity for the consumer.”",
            "He added: “All three small reactor manufacturers participating in the bid have initiated formal construction permit procedures with the regulator in major countries, and it is believed that the first reactors of their kind to be built will produce electricity at the end of the decade. It is justified to choose the best reactor technology of the new generation, which has already proven itself, to be built in Estonia.\"",
            "Fermi Energia is planning to build a new generation small reactor in Estonia to ensure electricity production independent of the weather at a long-term fixed price starting at 55€/MWh for its customers. The costs of building a small reactor with standardised, factory-produced components are significantly lower than in the case of large nuclear plants built so far, and the short construction time also helps to reduce the risk of delays and related costs.",
            "\"Compared with long-term fixed-price contracts offered to private and industrial consumers on the Baltic market, the electricity produced by a small reactor is many times more affordable, and we want to offer it to consumers with whom we have signed fixed-price electricity supply cooperation contracts,\" Kallemets said.",
            "\"Both NuScale and GE Hitachi are companies with financial support from the United States government, the British government has invested GBP210 million in the development of Rolls-Royce's small modular reactor,\" said Marti Jeltsov, Chief Technology Officer of Fermi Energia. “All three companies have achieved design maturity over the past few years, which provides significant certainty to the feasibility of the projects. The arrival of the new generation of small reactors on the market also gives Fermi Energia the opportunity to move ahead with the technology selection at a faster pace than planned.”",
            "GE Hitachi's BWRX-300 small reactor has so far been Fermi Energia's reference technology in nearly ten studies, and the construction site for construction of this reactor is already underway near Toronto, Canada. NuScale and Rolls-Royce plan to start their first constructions in the coming years.",

Therefore, we want to make it as safe as possible.” He added that the tectonics in the village of Ulken near Lake Balkhash are quite different from those at Fukushima.",
            "He noted that Kazakhstanis have little professional experience to work at nuclear power plants. “And for one station, we need about 2,000 permanent people. And these are not just workers, they must have detailed knowledge of nuclear and atomic physics. Therefore, at the first stage, we will agree that the station will be managed jointly with the licensor so that our personnel can gain the necessary experience,” he explained.",
            "President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Zhomart Tokayev, stated that the republic would “lose the entire economy” without the construction of a nuclear power plant and would lose its regional leadership. According to him, the country \"really needs clean nuclear power.\" He also instructed the government to intensify work to increase understanding of the importance of nuclear energy in Kazakhstan.",
            "Earlier, Energy Minister Akchulakov said that Kazakhstan would decide on the technology for the construction of a nuclear power plant at the end of 2022 or early 2023. At the end of June, Kazakhstan excluded the US and Japan from its original list of potential technology suppliers on the grounds that there was no experience in the construction and operation of the proposed reactors.",
            "The Energy Ministry had been looking at technologies from six global suppliers based on previously submitted proposals from the USA (NuScale Power), USA-Japan (GE-Hitachi), South Korean (Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power – KHNP), China (China National Nuclear Corporation – CNNC), Russia (Rosatom) and France (EDF). “Given the lack of experience … in the construction and operation of low-power reactors proposed by NuScale Power and GE-Hitachi, this technology is considered as a promising direction only for the subsequent development of nuclear energy,” the Ministry told Interfax-Kazakhstan. The Ministry noted that for the first NPP, only time-tested large-scale reactor technologies with existing operating experience were being considered.",
            "Timur Zhantikin, General Director of Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants, confirmed that four technologies were being considered: KHNP (South Korea) with APR-1000, APR-1400 reactors; CNNC (China) with HPR-1000, CNP-600+ reactors; Rosatom (Russia) with VVER-1200, VVER-1000 reactors; and EDF (France) with the ATMEA1 reactor.",
            "Kazakhstan and Rosatom at the beginning of this year signed a memorandum of cooperation on training personnel in the peaceful use of atomic energy. Also, a memorandum of understanding on nuclear energy development was signed by Kazakhstan Nuclear Power Plants and KHNP in June.",
            "According to the Energy Ministry, construction of one NPP would take up to 10 years, and the cost on average $5 billion. In the forecast energy balance of Kazakhstan to 2035, one of the options is the commissioning of NPPs with a total capacity of 2.4GWe. Kazakhstan ranks first in the world in the production of natural uranium and has its own facility producing nuclear fuel."

            "US-based Last Energy, which is developing a new fully small modular reactor (SMR), has announced an agreement with Poland’s Legnica Special Economic Zone (LSSE) to scale nuclear energy in Poland. Last Energy aims to develop 10 SMRs in the LSSE to fuel industrial activity. LSSE is home to more than 75 companies and over 16,000 jobs. The 10 power plants will deliver 200MW of capacity to the region.",
            "Last Energy said the agreement marks a significant step toward widespread SMR deployment, representing more than $1 billion in investment and more than $5 billion of electricity sales. Last Energy said its power plant uses a proven pressurised water reactor and fully modular plant design, which, it said, dramatically reduces the time and cost of plant construction. However, as yet the company has no prototype for its planned 20MWe SMR.",
            "In June, during the 590 Congress, Last Energy also announced an agreement with Poland’s Enea Group to pursue the development of Last Energy’s SMRs. “Poland is one of the first countries where Last Energy plans to implement our SMR technology,” said Damian Jamroz, General Manager of Last Energy Polska. “We’re glad that the Legnica Special Economic Zone has expressed its interest in locating one of the planned investments in their area, as well as the intention to sign a long-term contract for the energy produced. Now, we will begin the process of identifying potential locations.”",
            "LSSE President Przemysław Bożek noted: “Potential investors are increasingly faced with a lack of availability of energy and gas in the quantities they need. This project would allow for a safe, stable and emission-free source of energy for factories located in the Zone. We are taking another step not only towards green energy, but also to strengthen energy security.”",
            "Bret Kugelmass, founder and CEO of Last Energy, said: “Nuclear energy offers countries a powerful strategy to achieve both. Today’s agreement is a critical step toward bringing stable, reliable and cost-competitive energy to Poland, and establishing a much-needed model for how energy security and climate goals can align for the industrial sector.”",
            "The previous day, a letter of intent was signed between LSSE, Last Energy and DB Energy concerning participation in the construction and integration process in the Zone of the 10 SMRs and their operation for 24 years. Last Energy's offer covers the entire investment process – from the design concept, through design, arrangements, financing, implementation, service, maintenance and production of energy for the client, to the disposal of installations and fuel.",
            "This was based on an agreement signed at the beginning of June between DB Energy, Last Energy and the LSSE, which was aimed at confirming the technical possibilities as well as financial and economic benefits from the implementation of SMR technology in the Zone.",
            "Poland has become a focus for companies developing SMR technology. These include GE Hitachi Nuclear Power with Synthos Green Energy; Orlen or ZE PAK, interested in the BWRX-300 reactor; and NuScale Power in co-operation with KGHM and Tauron.",

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has said that it directed staff to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s small modular reactor (SMR) design for use in the United States. The certification’s effective date is 30 days after the NRC publishes the rule in the Federal Register.",
            "NRC said certification means the design “meets the agency’s applicable safety requirements”. An application for a NPP combined licence that references a certified design “will not need to address any of the issues resolved by the design certification rule”. Instead, the combined licence application and NRC’s safety review would address any remaining safety and environmental issues for the proposed nuclear power plant. The design certification “approves the NuScale reactor’s ‘design control document’, which is incorporated by reference in the final rule”.",
            "NuScale submitted an application to NRC in December 2016, to certify the company’s SMR design for use in the United States. NRC said staff met its schedule goals for completing its technical review. The design uses natural, “passive” processes such as convection and gravity in its operating systems and safety features, while producing up to approximately 600 megawatts of electricity. The SMR’s 12 modules, each producing 50 megawatts, are all submerged in a safety-related pool built below ground level.",
            "NRC previously certified six other designs: the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor, System 80+, AP600, AP1000, the Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor and the APR1400.",
            "Meanwhile, NuScale Power, the previous day signed a business collaboration agreement with National Technical Systems (NTS) to begin development of an Equipment Qualification (EQ) Test Chamber. This technology, built by NTS, will allow NuScale to mimic the range of environmental conditions under which NuScale equipment is required to function in order to meet NRC and plant-specific requirements.",
            "NTS is a leading test, inspection, and certification company with more than four decades of experience working in the nuclear sector, including in the areas of safety relief valve testing, repair services, and fuels and fluid testing. As part of the agreement, NTS will design, fabricate, and commission the EQ Chamber at its facility in Huntsville, Alabama, that will ultimately support critical testing for equipment used in NuScale’s SMR under a schedule to enable the timely delivery of NuScale Power Modules to customers by 2027."

The current conflict in Ukraine is certain to roll back Russia’s participation in the nuclear power programmes of NATO countries, even those with decades of experience using Soviet/Russian nuclear technology. However, for newcomer countries, and others in Central Asia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, this is unlikely to be a key factor in their technology choices. No other nuclear supplier offers such all-round support, including soft financing and BOO options. Russia takes a long view, committing to support that may last a century, sometimes begining with assistance in establishing nuclear research centres and research reactors. Extensive training is also provided as well as fuel supply, used fuel management services and decommissioning. So, while other suppliers, in particular the USA, are making rapid inroads in Europe, the rest of the world may still prefer to look to Moscow."
