            "‘We expect a growing number of reactors of between 30 MW-100 MW,’ CORE POWER boss tells NucNet",
            "Prospects for civilian maritime nuclear power projects may come closer to reality as the legal and safety standards for this emerging segment of the industry come together, where the global shipping industry, among others, is a key stakeholder for its long-term finance.",
            "CORE POWER is one of these companies. The group is developing the Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) in a US-based joint-collaboration between Southern Company, TerraPower and HD Hyundai’s sub-holding company, HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE).",
            "“It’s a 20-year programme, and we are now in year 12,” Mikal Boe, CORE POWER’s chairman and chief executive officer, told NucNet.",
            "He added that “we expect a small prototype of the MCFR reactor to be built by 2028 and to have the first operational unit by the mid-2030s.”",
            "“The fundamental characteristics of the molten salt reactor give us passive safety in the machines, which is different from a conventional light water reactor,” Boe said.  ",
            "In relation to financing for the maritime nuclear power sector, he said that “we cannot do it all alone, so we partner with financially strong organisations and as a result, the programme is exceptionally well-funded”.",
            "The way forward is “the creation of more public private partnerships between governments and technology development consortia,” he added.",
            "“We have already received funding from the US Department of Energy, for a portion of the programme.”",
            "The difference in funding in civil maritime nuclear power is based on “having strategic investors from our customer base in the shipping and energy industries; from trading houses, shipyards, banks and utilities. This is a good model for investment, because finding long-term nuclear financing is difficult,” according to Boe. ",
            "He said that “most of the civilian maritime nuclear power regulation is already in place, but to meet the criteria of both marine and nuclear standards, the gaps between the two must be closed between now and 2030.”",
            "The maritime nuclear sector requires a wider combination of shipping, nuclear and insurance regulation and standards, including safety and commercial liability, compared to legal terms and safeguards criteria for existing large and small modular reactor technologies.",
            "“A key condition for commercial nuclear power to develop in the maritime sector is the introduction of a liability convention to allow commercial insurability, which is expected to be completed by 2030,” Boe told NucNet. ",
            "“Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] director-general, called for a roadmap of a combined ecosystem on maritime and nuclear regulations just two weeks ago,” Boe added. ",
            "Grossi has said in an IAEA statement that “for nuclear energy to become a viable option to reduce commercial shipping’s 3% contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions, a clear roadmap is essential”.",
            "Grossi said: “International collaboration will be crucial to this effort and the IAEA will be at the heart of these efforts.”  ",
            "Boe told NucNet that “IMO [International Maritime Organisation] members and IAEA members have been working for a number of years to understand how those regulations can be joined, and we now see nuclear power on the agenda at the IMO, with a goal to update the existing code of safety for nuclear ships.”",
            " The maritime nuclear sector will provide clean energy for the shipping industry in compliance with new environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulations for the industry.  ",
            "“We expect a growing number of reactors of between 30 MW-100MW to be deployed in the 2030s with a 20 to 30-year lifecycle, at a cost which is competitive with LNG,” according to Boe. ",
            "“CORE POWER’s main markets are in OECD [Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries, including the US, the UK, Japan, South Korea, the EU and Canada, where we expect demand for domestic production to increase and for shipbuilding to grow to meet climate and energy security goals.  In the OECD we can focus on well-funded commercial industries in countries which already have civilian nuclear power in place,” Boe said.",
            "China and Russia are developing their own technologies, with China expected to release its own maritime civil nuclear units within a decade, but with both countries working under different regulatory frameworks compared to the OECD.",
            "Existing Russian naval reactors are pressurised water reactor units that run on high-enriched uranium and have a large emergency preparedness zone, so they cannot be insured commercially.",
            "However, low or ambient-pressure reactors hold the promise of a dramatically reduced emergency planning area.",
            "The Nuclear Energy Maritime Organisation (Nemo) was recently created in support of shipping industry interest in civil nuclear power. Lloyd’s Register is one of the founding members.",
            "Mikal Boe said CORE POWER expects to build a small prototype reactor by 2028. Courtesy CORE POWER."

            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",
            "“The reason behind this race toward nuclear is simple,” she said. “The world needs more power, and we need it sooner than projected.”",

            "This guide builds on a 2022 DOE study that found hundreds of US coal power plant sites across the country could be converted to nuclear power plant sites. ",
            "The study said the coal-to-nuclear transition could help increase nuclear capacity in the US to more than 250 GW. The existing fleet currently has a combined capacity of 95 GW and supplies half of the nation’s emissions-free electricity, the DOE said.",

            "Grossi took part on 17 January in a high-level reception with Microsoft founder and nuclear energy advocate Gates and Belgian prime minister Alexander De Croo on ‘Clean Tech Innovation on the Road to Net Zero’. Grossi and De Croo are jointly hosting the first Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels from 21-22 March 2024.",
            "“We really need to get going with nuclear mixing with renewables,” Gates said. “Nuclear is complementary to a lot more renewables, maybe fifty to ninety per cent of renewables.”",
            "TerraPower, a company co-founded by Gates, is planning to deploy its Natrium advanced reactors at retiring coal sites in the US and potentially also overseas.",
            "Grossi said on social media platform X that nuclear has a low carbon footprint and land use, abundant uranium resources and provides reliable, weather-independent power. He said the nuclear power industry has sufficient safeguards for regulated, compact and manageable waste.",
            "In an article for WEF, Grossi wrote that “fears about nuclear are slowly giving way to fact-based understanding”.",
            "He said in the article: “This year, for the first time, the document agreed at Cop28 backed nuclear energy investment among low-emissions technologies.",
            "He said “one of nuclear power’s key attributes is its energy intensity. A thimble-sized pellet of uranium produces as much energy as almost three barrels of oil, more than 350 cubic metres of natural gas and about half a tonne of coal”.",
            "Grossi added that each year, nuclear power plants produce a quarter of the world’s low-carbon electricity, saving many lives that would otherwise be cut short by the lethal pollution fossil fuels pump into the air.",
            "“Nuclear energy is about as safe as solar. It is far safer than coal, gas and oil, and safer than almost every other alternative energy source,” he said.",
            "According to Grossi, three main levers will need to be pulled if the world is to triple today’s investment levels and build the nuclear capacity that will help get it to net zero.",
            "“Nuclear must be acknowledged for what it is, namely a reliable, scalable, safe and highly affordable low-carbon source of energy and must be treated that way when it comes to investment incentives.”",
            "He recommended that governments need to come up with funding for the upfront costs and leverage multilateral private finance.  ",
            "However, the nuclear power industry needs to respond to the challenge of the rising interest towards nuclear power, seizing the moment to deliver new capacity on time and on budget, while achieving a greater level of industrial standardisation, incorporating safety, security and safeguards at the design stage.",

            "Companies in Asian countries leading the way",
            "Innovation in nuclear fusion is seeing its sharpest rise in almost a decade, according to the latest patent data published by leading UK intellectual property firm, Appleyard Lees.",
            "The company’s Inside Green Innovation: Progress Report Third Edition – which analyses global patent filings across several key environmental issues, including nuclear power – shows a 50% year-on-year increase in patent filings, from 107 to 159, to 2021.",
            "Appleyard Lees said such innovation investment has not been seen in the sector since 2004-2005 and the start of the Millennium, with companies in Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and China leading the charge. ",
            "The findings come as 22 countries signed a pledge at Cop28 in Dubai to triple nuclear generation capacity by 2050 from a base year of 2020 at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai. This will involve inviting shareholders of international financial institutions to encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in lending policies.",
            "Appleyard Lees partner and patent attorney, Richard Bray said that while patent filings for nuclear fusion and fission peaked in the 1970s and 80s – falling significantly through the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s – data from 2021 shows the start of a potential upward trend in filing activity not seen since 2000-2001.",
            "“It will be interesting to see if this trend continues… and which companies are leading this renewed period of innovation and patent filing. It is an exciting time for the nuclear industry as a whole.”",
            "According to the Fusion Industry Association, investment in the fusion sector has now reached over $6bn globally, with at least $4.2bn (€3.8bn) invested in the last two years. The single, largest investment in fusion energy was $1.8bn to US-based fusion reactor developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in 2022. Commonwealth Fusion Systems now has total declared funding of more than $2bn. ",
            "Appleyard Lees said many companies receiving recent investment are targeting fusion power to grid by 2030. ",
            "It said the stand-out area of fusion innovation, as shown by the patent data, is in magnets and magnetic properties, essential components in existing fusion reactor designs. Since 2018, there has been an increase in new patent filings for high temperature superconductors – potentially seen as game changing for numerous industries. Prime movers include UK-based Tokamak Energy, with two-thirds of its patent applications covering this type of technology, and the Korean Electrotechnology Research Institute, which tops the list with 11 patent filings in 2021. ",
            "Innovation in nuclear fission is most visible in small modular reactors. Patent filings relating to this technology jumped by 100% from 2019-2020 (from 19 to 38) and fell only marginally in 2021. ",
            "“While the previous innovation spike in SMRs is attributed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident, the latest resurgence appears driven by interest in the microreactor concept, with offer smaller footprints than SMRs, and the capacity to produce up to 10 MW,” Appleyard Lees said.",
            "Notable patent filers in SMR and microreactors include large organisations such as Westinghouse, Korea Atomic Energy and Rolls-Royce. However, smaller companies – such as Nuscale and Terrapower, founded by Bill Gates – also appear in the list.",

            "The Natrium demonstration project, being built in Kemmerer, Wyoming, will be a commercial scale plant and will begin operations within a decade.  ",
            "TerraPower and UEC have made significant investments in the nuclear fuel cycle and commercial scale deployment of clean energy projects that will directly benefit the US economy, the statement said.",
            "This includes providing support for establishing a robust US nuclear fuel supply chain for small modular reactors and advanced reactors and their high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) requirements. ",
            "Haleu is an essential advanced nuclear fuel required for the development of most next-generation reactor designs. It is needed for 90% of advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the US Department of Energy’s advanced reactor demonstration programme.",
            "“SMRs and advanced reactors present the fastest growing segment of nuclear energy in the US and need a secure, domestic fuel supply chain,” the companies said. ",
            "“The first step of the supply chain is uranium, and UEC’s Wyoming resources have the critical mass to be a highly reliable source of uranium for American Haleu and a good strategic fit to supply TerraPower’s Natrium reactor.”",

            "Existing coal plants can provide key benefits and opportunities that make them “a compelling option” for the deployment of nuclear generation, but prominent issues around perceived risk and nuclear waste management need to be resolved, a report concludes.",
            "The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) report, From Coal to Nuclear: A Practical Guide for Developing Nuclear Energy Facilities in Coal Plant Communities, says repurposing a coal plant’s infrastructure could be an option to help sustain coal communities while providing a carbon-free source of generation through nuclear power. ",
            "It outlines the process for determining if locations are suitable for development, factors to consider when selecting the reactor type, and regulatory considerations including water and transmission rights.",
            "From a technical perspective, issues such as perceived risk and nuclear waste management can be overcome, and many advanced reactor designs address these concerns, the report says. But “it is something that must be understood and evaluated when making the business decision to deploy nuclear”.",
            "“Since coal communities have had experience with power generation, this shared experience can be a good point for the owner-operator and local stakeholders to start a conversation,” the report says.",
            "Power plant closures can adversely impact local communities that benefit from the facility through jobs and tax revenue. Until recently, newly constructed natural gas-fired power units often replaced decommissioned coal plants, but governments are encouraging the redevelopment of the sites for other forms of low- or zero-carbon power generation.",
            "According to the report, nuclear power is key to bringing emissions targets within reach for many countries. With the retirement of more coal plants, redeveloping these sites to deploy new nuclear generation could be the next step in the clean energy transformation. ",
            "Since 2000, more than 90 GW of US coal units have been retired, driven in large part by efforts to meet decarbonisation goals. By 2050, coal plants across 2,400 sites in 79 countries are expected to retire, representing 1,000 GW.",
            "There are several advantages to repowering an existing coal site for new generation, including existing transmission infrastructure and interconnection permits that may be able to be reused, modified, or extended. Many such sites have access to well-developed transportation infrastructure and existing utility connections for buildings. Existing environmental permits for a coal facility may be modifiable.",
            "The report says many current sites offer the advantage of access to a large daily water withdrawal and water discharge allowance.

Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

Funding for the project was signed off by Boris Johnson at the start of September in one of his last acts as prime minister and confirmed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement. The twin EPR station is a joint endeavour with French state energy giant EDF and is expected to take a decade to build at the cost of between £20-£30bn. Large-scale reactors are under construction or consideration around the world. Test production has begun at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Flamanville-3 in France is close to completion, while fuel is being loaded at Vogtle in the US. Construction continued at Akkuyu, Turkey’s first nuclear station, with a second under consideration. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, around 30 countries are considering or embarking on the construction of new reactors. They include established nuclear nations such as the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, China and India, and newcomers such as Poland, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The International Energy Agency says a new wave of construction will be key to achieving net zero and ensuring energy security.  ",

Three Westinghouse-made AP1000 pressurised water reactor units will be deployed at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the northern province of Pomerania. The first unit is scheduled to be online in 2033 as set in Warsaw’s 2020 nuclear energy programme while the start of construction is earmarked for 2026. Under a 2020 nuclear programme, Poland has ambitious plans to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear with commercial operation of a first nuclear unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033, with the rest to follow throughout the 2030s and into the early 2040s. Warsaw Also said it remains “open” to cooperation with the European and global nuclear industries for the deployment of a second nuclear power plant in the country despite selecting Westinghouse for the construction of a first nuclear power station. Polish energy companies ZE PAK and PGE signed a letter of intent with South Korea’s KHNP for the proposed construction of a third nuclear power station at the Patnow site in central Poland – a project described as one to be developed by “private business” and not run by the government.",

            "Repowering existing coal plant infrastructure – including with small modular reactors – is the largest single carbon abatement opportunity on the planet and could greatly accelerate the clean energy transition while using existing infrastructure and maintaining vital jobs and a major topic to watch in 2023 and beyond. A report by TerraPraxis said replacing coal-fired boilers at existing coal plants with carbon-free SMRs, also known as advanced heat sources, would transform coal-fired power plants from polluting liabilities facing an uncertain future, into a central component of a clean energy system transition – an important part of the massive and pressing infrastructure buildout needed to address climate change. The US Department of Energy said This “coal-to-nuclear” transition could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping the US reach its net-zero emissions goals by 2050. TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, plans to deploy its Natrium reactor technology at a coal site in the US state of Wyoming.

Oil-rich Saudi Arabia began the process of choosing a vendor\r\nfor the construction of its first commercial nuclear power station with bids likely to come from South Korea, France, China and Russia. Riyadh wants to build two 1,400 MW nuclear power plants, a down-sized effort from an ambitious goal set in 2014 to build 16 units of about 1,000 MW each. Saudi Arabia said earlier this year it is aiming to take advantage of its significant uranium resources to develop a commercial nuclear power programme. The United Arab Emirates, another of the world’s largest oil producers, is already building four reactors at Barakah. Two units are operating and a third is due to begin operating soon.",

            "“The US government has done an excellent job with the intergovernmental agreement with Poland and submitted a thorough concept execution report. The Poland proposal is not state-backed – the US does not do that. This is a different approach than the proposals by the French and the South Koreans,” Mr Tokpinar said.",
            "One potential challenge for new build is repairing supply chains that have been “broken” by the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, leading to supply a shortage of building materials and raw materials. This has resulted in price increases, which is being felt by the infrastructure project sector. ",
            "However, most purchasing for Natrium, and for Poland if and when it goes forward, is still a few years away and Bechtel is optimistic that supply chain issues will be resolved. “We will be placing contracts for a non-nuclear facility at the Natrium site in Wyoming in mid-2023, and we believe much of that work can be done by Wyoming companies,” Mr Tokpinar said.",
            "The construction sector in Poland is facing rising prices of materials caused by the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Analytics group GlobalData expects construction output in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to contract by 3.4% in 2022. This is due to contractions in the Russian and Ukrainian construction sectors, which are expected to slow by 8.5% and 69.1% respectively. ",
            "About 80 Polish companies are ready to take part in the construction of Poland’s first nuclear power plants. ",
            "“We will not be bringing in thousands of workers and exporting materials from the US,” Mr Tokpinar said. “We will hire thousands of Polish workers and probably hundreds of Polish companies as subcontractors”. ",
            "“We will transfer our knowhow of large, nuclear project management to these Polish companies, and when other nations such as the UK or the Czech Republic decide to build, guess who will be in line to support those projects? The Polish companies”.",
            "“In contrast, a state-backed proposal is by definition more focused on exports and staff to benefit that respective country”.",

            "He said: “Lessons from Vogtle-3 have been applied to Vogtle-4, and so on into future AP1000 plants.”",

        "title": "Bill Gates Company Urges US To Downblend HEU For Advanced Reactors",
        "text": [
            "“Downblending is only a temporary solution for the first core load,” TerraPower said. “This does not negate the need for a fully functional, fully funded advanced fuel availability programme for subsequent cores and to meet the growing demand of advanced nuclear technologies.”",
            "HEU is uranium that has been enriched to at least 20% uranium-235, a higher concentration than exists in natural uranium ore. It has been used in research reactors, military reactors and a small number of commercial reactors, but can also be used to make nuclear weapons. ",
            "The US has HEU stockpile estimated to be about 490 tonnes as of the beginning of 2020. ",
            "Advanced nuclear technologies are “vital” to meeting carbon-free energy targets, TerraPower said. New reactors need to be demonstrated this decade to ensure full commercial deployment in the 2030s and beyond. ",
            "Most advanced nuclear reactors under development in the US, including TerraPower’s own Natrium small modular reactor, rely on Haleu, or high assay low enriched uranium, fuel. Haleu fuel is a class of nuclear fuel that allows advanced nuclear reactors to deliver electricity with enhanced environmental benefits and greater efficiency that is unmatched by the current nuclear fleet.  ",
            "A major hurdle for the development and commercialisation of advanced nuclear reactors, however, is that there is currently no domestic supply chain of Haleu that can provide fuel at commercial levels. A full and viable fuel supply chain for advanced nuclear energy includes the mining, conversion and enrichment of uranium, deconversion of Haleu into a metal and the fabrication of fuel rods that ultimately power the reactors.   ",
            "In order to carve out a sustainable path to a carbon-free energy future, advanced nuclear energy fuelled by Haleu “must play a prominent role”, TerraPower said. At the same time, the US must dissolve its dependence on Russian uranium to produce nuclear fuel. Historically, the US has turned to Russia and its allies for a significant percentage of fuel to power the over 90 currently operating reactors in the US today.",
            "TerraPower has invested in a domestic Haleu supply chain on multiple fronts. However, early advanced reactor strategies relied on Russia’s established Haleu production facilities to provide the first core loads while domestic capabilities were developed. ",
            "“As a result of the invasion in Ukraine, this is no longer a viable approach and the urgency to develop domestic advanced fuel infrastructure has been thrust to the forefront,” TerraPower said.    ",
            "According to TerraPower, the US is taking steps in the right direction. Earlier this year, Congress appropriated $45m (€44m) for a programme to help expedite the commercialisation of Haleu in the US. The Inflation Reduction Act, recently signed into law by president Joe Biden, dictates special provisions for Haleu. This includes setting aside $700m to support the availability of Haleu for both research and commercial uses, the licensing of production facilities and the establishment of a Haleu stockpile. ",
            "“But one more critical piece of the puzzle remains,” TerraPower said. “In order for advanced nuclear development to stay on track we need a short-term solution, along with congressional support, until the domestic Haleu supply chain is fully operational.” ",

            "Converting 5,000 – 7,000 coal plant units globally between 2030 and 2050 (250 – 350 per year) will require a “redesigned delivery model” that has to de-risk the construction process, the riskiest part of a project.",
            "This means providing coal plant owners and investors with high-certainty schedules and budgets. Purpose-built automated tools can achieve rapid, repeatable, and confident project and planning assessments. ",
            "TerraPraxis has assembled a consortium of partners including Bryden Wood, Microsoft, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and University at Buffalo, along with a consortium of global utilities, to launch the ‘Repowering Coal’ initiative. The aim is to provide standardised, pre-licensed designs supported by automated project development and design tools to enable customers to be ready to start construction on their SMR projects in the late 2020s.",
            "Bryden Wood, a UK-based design and engineering firm, has created a new design and construction solution that the group says would make such a programme possible at scale and speed, in part by deploying a new digital platform.",
            "“The result of this repowering will be carbon-free power plants that are cheaper to operate than before, and to ensure continuity for communities reliant on these plants for energy, jobs, and continued economic development,” Eric Ingersoll, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis said.",
            "Kirsty Gogan, co-founder and managing partner of TerraPraxis, said that by sustaining permanent high-quality jobs for communities, repowered coal plants reduce the negative impacts on communities to public and political support for a just transition. ",
            "“The challenge is not only to build enough clean electricity generation to power the world, but to do so quickly while building the infrastructure required to decarbonise end-use sectors such as heat, industry, and transport,” she said at the Nuclear Innovation Conference in Amsterdam.",
            "Grogan said the plan is to replace the existing coal plant boiler with a standardised advanced heat source (AHS) that fits into a standardised facility. A new heat transfer and storage system will run between the existing coal plant and the AHS, which is itself in two parts: the reactor within a modular, component-based enclosure, and another enclosure with support systems. A modular heat transfer system and associated energy storage will allow the plant to efficiently match reactor output with generation demand.”",
            "There will be regulatory challenges to repurposing coal plants. They vary widely and developing a new SMR design for each plant would be complex, costly, and slow. Rather than thousands of individual projects, TerraPraxis’ aim is to develop a unified approach where the design is simplified and standardised to make this plan a reality as quickly as possible.",
            "Gogan said: “Our building system is designed to reduce regulatory scope by firstly separating the power island from the heat island via thermal energy storage. ",
            "“This means that no accident propagation is possible from the power island to the heat island, and that the power island has no nuclear safety requirements. ",
            "Secondly, safety by design characteristics of the advanced heat sources means that safety is achieved with no active safety systems. This reduces complexity and means that all safety-related systems can be combined in one reactor building.”",
            "The relatively small reactor building, assembled from pre-fabricated components, therefore becomes the only safety-related building. “As part of their initial license review, the regulator will have already reviewed this exact configuration and its associated building designs,” Gogan said.",
            "According to TerraPraxis, the world has more than 2 TW of coal-fired electric power plants, adding roughly 12 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions per year. These annual emissions amount to almost one-third of global total forecast net annual emissions of 38.8 Gt/year.",
            "Some policymakers, climate modelers and activists assume that countries will simply shut down their coal plants to reduce carbon emissions. However, because more than half of coal plants worldwide are less than 14 years old, it is unrealistic to expect such young assets to simply retire, especially considering growing energy demand and supply shortages.",
            "“Even in countries with relatively old coal plants, such as the US, Canada and Europe, closing coal plants is difficult and controversial because the loss of jobs and revenues can be devastating for communities, and utilities continue to value the reliable electricity generated,” TerraPraxis says.",
            "In Wyoming, the largest state producer of coal in the US, roughly 80% of electricity production comes from coal-fired power plants that have been steadily declining in terms of their output, but also closing down, since the mid-2000.",
            "Late last year, as part of a project involving companies run by billionaires Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, a retiring coal plant site in Kemmerer, Wyoming, was chosen as the preferred location for a new generation Natrium nuclear power reactor.",
            "US-based reactor developer TerraPower said it had chosen the Kemmerer location, near the Naughton coal power plant about 100 km northeast of Salt Lake City, following an extensive evaluation process and meetings with community members and leaders. It said the new plant could be in operation by 2028.",
            "By locating the Natrium reactor near the retiring Naughton coal plant, TerraPower can take advantage of the existing energy infrastructure that is in place –cooling water and transmission, for example – and also the workforce.",
            "US-based SMR developer NuScale Power has said building SMRs at the “considerable” number of fossil fuel and coal plants that will be going out of service towards the end of the decade and beyond means workers can be cross-trained and millions of dollars saved by using existing infrastructure.",
            "“The infrastructure is all there and we can save about $100m by using it,” chief executive officer John Hopkins said. “We are in talks with a couple of potential customers.”",
            "NuScale conducted a study in the US which estimated that, on average, approximately $100m of existing coal plant infrastructure such the plant’s cooling water delivery systems, site fire protection and existing transmission system connection could be reused for a NuScale plant. The company has also signed a number of agreements for potential SMR deployment in Europe, including coal sites in Poland.",

            "Carrying out the TWIST experiment at TREAT (Image: Idaho National Laboratory)",
            "The experiment, known as the TWIST experiment, uses a specially developed experiment holder - the TWIST capsule - to hold a fuel sample surrounded by water, which can be rapidly drained during testing. The TREAT Facility produces transient pulses - short, sudden bursts of energy that are five times more powerful than a commercial reactor - which, together with the TWIST capsule, can simulate loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions in a controlled environment.",
            "LOCA testing is a key part of assessing the behaviour of nuclear fuels and materials, to ensure that equipment maintains its intended safety function should an accident occur when a reactor core loses its cooling water more rapidly than it can be replaced. However, the USA has not been able to perform LOCA tests since Idaho National Laboratory's Power Burst Facility shut down in the mid-1980s. Since then, it has collaborated with Norway to carry out safety tests using the Halden Boiling Water Reactor, but since that reactor closed in 2018, LOCA testing has only been possible in one test reactor in Russia.",
            "The TWIST experiment restores the USA's ability to perform LOCA testing and supports the development of accident tolerant fuels that could extend operating cycles and reduce the amount fuel needed to operate commercial reactors, according to the Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy.",
            "\"Loss of coolant accident testing is essential to developing new fuels that will boost the performance of our nuclear power plants and help them run more efficiently,\" said Bill McCaughey, director of advanced fuel technologies for the Office of Nuclear Energy.",
            "The TREAT facility was built in the 1950s, originally to test fast reactor fuels. It was placed on standby in 1994, but the Department of Energy in 2013 proposed re-establishing the capability to conduct transient testing to aid in the development of new, advanced, safer and more efficient reactor fuels, leading to a decision to restart the facility. TREAT restarted in 2017 and resumed operations in 2018.",
            "Idaho National Laboratory made modifications to TREAT to accommodate a larger experiment rig that can be used by TWIST and future experiments at the facility and will also be used for upcoming sodium loop tests to support the development of TerraPower’s Natrium small modular reactor.",

            "The report is underpinned by a study carried out by the Argonne, Idaho and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, sponsored by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy. It is guided by three overarching questions: where in the USA are retired coal facilities located and what factors make a site feasible for transition; what factors of technology, cost, and project timeline drive investor economics over such a decision; and how will C2N impact local communities?",
            "The team screened recently retired and active coal plant sites to identify 157 retired and 237 operating coal plants sites as potential candidates for a C2N transition, which it further evaluated on parameters including population density, distance from seismic fault lines, flooding potential, and nearby wetlands, to determine if they could safely host a nuclear power plant. It found that 80% of the potential sites are suitable for hosting advanced nuclear power plants of varying size and type, depending on the size of the site being converted.",

            "The BANDI-60 - under development since 2016 - is a block-type pressurised water reactor with a power output of 200MWt/60MWe. According to Kepco E&C, the block-type design - in which the main components are directly connected, nozzle-to-nozzle, instead of using connecting pipes - can eliminate the risk of a large-break loss-of-coolant accident and also provides improved operational surveillance and maintenance as compared with the integral type design. The reactor would operate at a temperature of around 325°C. To enhance the safety and performance, Kepco C&E says several advanced design features are adopted such as soluble boron-free operation, an in-vessel control rod drive mechanism, and top-mounted in-core instrumentation.",

Also attending the ceremony were TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque, and government representatives as well as South Korean officials including SK Group Vice Chairman Yoo Jung-joon and SK Executive Vice President Kim Moo-hwan.",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower selected an ageing coal plant in Kemmerer owned by US PacifiCorp as the preferred site for the demonstration project. The site is adjacent to PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant, which will stop burning coal in 2026 and natural gas a decade later, according to the utility. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The construction project is expected to cost up to $4bn, half funded by the ARDP. The company has raised about $1bn, including investments from Gates as well as South Korea-based SK Inc and SK Innovation, according to PitchBook. DOE has provided long-standing support for TerraPower’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D. This resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology.",
            "According to the TerraPower website, the ARDP authorises a 50/50 cost share and authorises up to $2bn for the Natrium project. “TerraPower and partners will match this investment dollar for dollar. The first-of-a-kind cost for the Natrium demonstration plant will include the reactor design and licensing, codes and methods development, fuel development and qualification, and the design, construction and operation of two supporting facilities: the Natrium Fuel Fabrication Facility and Sodium Test and Fill Facility. The sodium facility will be used to test and demonstrate the performance of first-of-a-kind equipment prior to operations in the reactor plant.”",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources.

However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030.",
            "Bill Gates, discussing the ground-breaking ceremony on his",
            "personal blog, claims: “Kemmerer, Wyoming will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world.”",
            "He says: “The plant was designed by TerraPower, a company I started in 2008. But my nuclear journey started several years earlier, when I first read a scientific paper for a new type of nuclear power plant. The design was far safer than any existing plant, with the temperatures held under control by with the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes. It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night. As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it— and revolutionize how we generate power in the US and around the world…. But that technology was just an idea in a lab and on a computer screen until today.”",
            "Gates expects the NRC review process to take a couple of years. “So in the meantime, TerraPower will continue to build the non-nuclear parts of the facility”. Construction will begin next year on the so-called “energy island,” which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit. (The reactor will eventually be part of a “nuclear island,” and the team hopes to start building that in 2026.)” He adds: “While these first-of-a-kind projects can be big and risky, they are too important for our future to fail to act.”",
            "In an earlier blog in May 2023, Gates provides some more comments on the reactor technology. “Like other power plant designs, it uses heat to turn water into steam, which moves a turbine, which generates electricity. And like other nuclear facilities, it generates the heat by splitting uranium atoms in a chain reaction. But that’s pretty much where the similarities stop.”",
            "He continues: “A typical reactor keeps the atom-splitting nuclear reaction under control by circulating water around a uranium core. But using water as a coolant presents two challenges. First, water isn’t very good at absorbing heat — it turns to steam and stops absorbing heat at just 100 degrees C. Second, as water gets hot, its pressure goes up, which puts strain on your pipes and other equipment. If there’s an emergency — say, an earthquake cuts off all the electricity to the plant and you can’t keep pumping water — the core continues to make heat, raising the pressure and potentially causing an explosion.”",
            "He therefore believes liquid metal is a better coolant than water. “The Natrium plant uses liquid sodium, whose boiling point is more than eight times higher than water’s, so it can absorb all the extra heat generated in the nuclear core. Unlike water, the sodium doesn’t need to be pumped, because as it gets hot, it rises, and as it rises, it cools off. Even if the plant loses power, the sodium just keeps absorbing heat without getting to a dangerous temperature that would cause a meltdown.”",
            "On the plant’s molten salt energy storage system, he says this will allow the Natrium facility to control how much electricity it produces at any given time. “That’s unique among nuclear reactors, and it’s essential for integrating with power grids that use variable sources like solar and wind.”",
            "He also extols TerraPower’s digital design process. “Using supercomputers, they’ve digitally tested the Natrium design countless times, simulating every imaginable disaster, and it keeps holding up. TerraPower’s sophisticated work has drawn interest from around the globe, including an agreement to collaborate on nuclear power technology in Japan and investments from the South Korean conglomerate SK and the multinational steel company ArcelorMittal.”",
            "While the TerraPower website provides some details of work done with molten salt, it contains very little information about the reactor technology. According to a video: “In the reactor building, advanced uranium fuel is inserted into an enclosed container and covered with liquid sodium. A chain reaction starts when uranium atoms slit and release neutrons and heat the metal coolant inside the reactor system…. The liquid sodium is heated and then transfers thermal energy to pipes filled with molten salt. This… then travels to a very large storage tank that serves as a thermal battery for the plant…. The molten salt passes near water-filled tubes and boils the water to make super heated steam. This… then helps to turn a turbine, creating electricity…. The molten salt is transferred to a cold tank and eventually back to the nuclear island.”",
            "Basically the Natrium reactor is a sodium-cooled fast reactora. Currently, the only commercially operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029 and probably qualifies as the most advanced reactor facility in the world.",
            "While research on fast reactors took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, things began to change in the late 1970s as concerns about scarce uranium resources waned and public opinion became increasingly hostile in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the USA and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. By the early 1990s the US, the UK and Germany had closed down their programmes. France continued with its Phenix and SuperPhenix projects for a few more years, finally closing SuperPhenix in 1998 and Phenix in 2009, Subsequently, in 2019, France also cancelled the Generation IV ASTRID sodium-cooled fast reactor demonstrator design project. Although interest is now reviving in Europe and the USA both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the early design phase and is probably decades away from implementation.",
            "As an example, India’s prototype sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor began fuel loading in March. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) began to design the reactor in 1980 and construction began in 2004, 24 years later. It was originally expected to be commissioned in 2010 but suffered a series of delays over the next 14 years."

            "“The formation of the first order book starts in 2028-29,” Bøe told Ship & Bunker at the event. “Our aim is to build a $10bn order book by 2030, and the first deliveries would then be in 2030-35 — we’re not quite sure, but I’d say probably in the latter end of that bucket.”",
            "He added that the initial orderbook would probably be for FNPPs. “It’s kind of a low-hanging fruit, a very big market, and it’s easier to deliver from a regulatory point of view. “But I would expect to see the first ship orders coming through not too late after that.”",
            "A nuclear-powered ship would have a number of advantages including zero carbon emissions, while the excess energy produced by the reactor would enable ship to travel faster with the possibility of sending power back to the land-based grid while at berth. However, the high up-front capital costs for a ship of this type, would be around $700m.",
            "Core Power plans to lobby for updates to standards from the the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the Inernational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to provide a regulatory framework for nuclear-powered shipping. Bøe expects the IMO to modernise and revise its current code for nuclear merchant ships by 2028. “We think the IAEA is pretty much ready to do this. “They’re doing it now, and I think that they’ll be ready before the IMO,” he noted. “And then, of course, you really need to work separately with the insurance industry to make sure that they have the right liability regime in place.”",
            "Bøe told the meeting that the molten salt reactor (MSR) design that Core Power is working on, using heated and liquefied chloride salts, can solve a number of issues for the maritime sector.",
            "MSR technologies were first tested in the US as a nuclear option for aircraft in the 1950s. A six-year experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory then tested the technology before being cancelled. Bøe stressed that this was using old technology and designs and the new designs would not face a similar fate.",
            "Bøe said the first vessel using MSR technology could be launched as early as the mid-2030s, with the company about to build a micro-reactor to test the design, at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in the US, before then producing a commercial prototype. In August 2022, Core Power, MIT Energy Initiative and INL were awarded research funding by DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program, a three-year study into the development of offshore floating nuclear power generation in the USA.",
            "Core Power is also a participant with US-based TerraPower and power utility Southern Co, in the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE). In 2021, Southern Company DOE signed an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE as a proof-of-concept critical fast-spectrum salt reactor. MCRE aims to be which the world’s first fast-spectrum salt reactor to achieve criticality at INL, Collaborators in the MCRE project are Terrapower, INL, Orano (USA) Federal Services, Electric Power Research Institute, and 3M Company.",
            "The project is supported through the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) under a five-year, $170m cost-shared funding agreement. It will provide crucial operational data to support the future development of TerraPower’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR), informing the design, licensing and operation of a demonstration reactor.",
            "Bøe said $2.5bn would be spent on development before a commercial ship is even ordered, much of the financing coming from the US government funds. That is in addition to $150m Washington has already invested, while Core Power shareholders, Wan Hai, Express Container Lines, Terrapower and Hyundai Heavy Industries have all invested in the MSR development. And a new funding round is expected in 2025-26.",
            "Core Power was formed in 2018 “to bridge that gap and create an organisation that would pave the way for development and successful deployment of advanced reactor technologies for the maritime industries”. In 2023, the company attracted Japanese investment for its FNPP project. Some 13 companies, including Onomichi Dockyard and Imabari Shipbuilding, had invested about $80m in project, according to Nikkei Asia. Although Core released no statement on the development, it reproduced the Nikkei article on its website.",
            "According to Nikkei, Core Power said at that time that it planned launch a demonstration vessel in 2026 and commercialise it between 2030 and 2032. The company aimed to build a track record overseas, then expand in Japan. It estimated that the demonstration vessel would require approximately JPY50bn ($361m), and Core Power and its partner companies would share the cost.

            "Framatome North America and US-based TerraPower have agreed to design and develop a high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) metallisation pilot line at Framatome’s nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Richland, Washington. The HALEU pilot line, which is currently under construction, will prove the viability of Framatome’s technology for metallisation to support the development of the advanced reactor market.",
            "The USA’s current commercial nuclear fuel cycle is based on low-enriched uranium enriched to less than 5%. HALEU, enriched to between 5% and 20% is required by many of the advanced reactor technologies that are currently under development. As yet no US domestic commercial source of HALEU available although Centrus is developing a HALEU production facility supported by the Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "DOE is pursuing various pathways to produce HALEU through its HALEU Availability Program (HAP), authorised by the Energy Act of 2020. The Inflation Reduction Act signed into law in 2022 included $700m to support HALEU development. Framatome has applied for DOE funding under the HAP Deconversion and Metallisation Request for Proposals. Successful completion and operation of the HALEU pilot plant will support Framatome’s efforts to expand the US fuel supply chain capabilities.",
            "Metallisation of HALEU is a crucial part of the HALEU fuel cycle. After enrichment, HALEU uranium hexafluoride must be “deconverted” to a form suitable for fuel fabrication. These include oxides, metal and alloys, nitrides and carbides. While this is traditionally done in fuel fabrication facilities, deconversion of HALEU enriched to more than 10% has to take place in a physical security Category II facility.",
            "“A strong domestic fuel supply chain is crucial for the wide-scale deployment of advanced nuclear energy solutions; an energy source we know is needed to meet clean energy targets and provide reliable, baseload energy,” said Chris Levesque, TerraPower President & CEO. “This investment by TerraPower into Framatome’s pilot line is a critical step in bringing advanced reactors like the Natrium technology to market. It is also one more way that TerraPower is delivering on its promise to do our part to support the fuel manufacturing sector.”",

In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for its Natrium reactor demonstration project.",
            "“This agreement advances fuel technologies for the nuclear energy industry and working pragmatically with TerraPower builds the trust and confidence our customers count on,” said Ala Alzaben, Senior Vice President for North America Fuel at Framatome. “TerraPower is at the forefront of the next generation of advanced reactors and by utilizing our expertise and flexible manufacturing infrastructure, we can ensure new clean nuclear projects are not waiting on the supply chain of nuclear fuels.”"

        "text": [
            "Impressive recent growth in the SMR project pipeline is just one more element of a tidal wave forming for the next great nuclear breakthrough.",
            "In the first quarter of 2024 the small nuclear reactor (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW. This, according to a new report from analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, represents growth of some 65% in the three years since 2021.",
            "Noting that just five countries lead the project pipeline – Canada, the Korean Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States are driving some 58% of those projects – the WoodMac analysis adds that even the current global project pipeline would require an investment of close to US$176bn.",
            "It’s clearly a substantial growth rate and is backed by serious investment, even if the whole extent of the current pipeline never reaches a positive final investment decision. And it’s a district possibility, if not outright probability, that such a situation may come to pass as some of these projects fall by the wayside. After all, there are obvious risks to consider, particularly in light of the high profile NuScale retrenchment. As an industry leader – and still the only SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – NuScale had been widely seen as something of a flag-bearer for this burgeoning new nuclear industry.",
            "It’s understandable then that the decision to abandon the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) being developed in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) was taken by many as a significant blow to the credibility of SMRs as a whole.",
            "However, to reach that conclusion would undoubtedly be an ill-considered approach. NuScale may have taken a step backwards, but it is hardly in full-blown retreat. Almost immediately after the CFPP decision was announced Standard Power revealed plans to work with NuScale to develop two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Standard business is as a provider of services to data companies and this may be taken as a giant neon sign pointing to at least one of the underlying drivers behind a global SMR boom. The unabated growth of energy-hungry data centres is likely to see an early and productive partnership between the two industries. They certainly won’t be alone though, given Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also the founder of Terrapower with its 345 MWe Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor technology.",
            "There’s other clear evidence of gathering momentum behind an SMR-led nuclear market too. With multiple policy initiatives reflecting a new appraisal of nuclear in general, there are also SMR-specific government-backed measures designed to push SMR technologies off the drawing board and into operation. Important regulatory efforts underway include the US NRC, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) recently signing a trilateral deal to collaborate on SMR and advanced modular reactor (AMR) design assessment. The agreement is designed to enable both good practice and experience of reviewing SMR/AMR designs to be shared between the regulators. All three bodies are already engaged with SMR design assessment – the NRC is conducting pre-application activities with Westinghouse regarding design certification for its AP300 SMR, as well as with Holtec International for its SMR 300, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear for licensing approval of its BWRX-300 design, for example. This new measure marks an important step toward a unified regulatory framework that is so important to the success of SMRs that are expected to be deployed in many different jurisdictions.",
            "Given the underlying fundamentals it’s perhaps not so surprising that in their net zero scenario, WoodMac sees SMRs accounting for around a third of the global nuclear fleet. It’s not a cloudless horizon, inevitably there are both economic and technical risks and challenges that must be overcome and to do so will require a long-term concerted effort from government, regulators and the private sector. But taken in the round there is every indication that the 65% growth in the project pipeline seen over the last three years will come to be regarded as a pretty poor show in the years that follow."

The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies.",
            "According to Reuters, fuel supply remains TerraPower’s main concern for the first plant, on which the company expects to begin non-nuclear-related construction in June. Director of External Affairs at TerraPower Jeff Navin said the supply of HALEU was considered the greatest uncertainty when planning for deployment. “We still think 2030 is our best bet as to when we can get things completed, but I can’t tell you today that I can account for every kilogram of HALEU that we will need, where it will come from, and when we’ll have it, so that that is certainly something that still keeps us up at night.”",
            "Plans for US-produced fuel are being expedited, including a two-phase project to produce 900 kg of HALEU a year by the nuclear fuel and services company, Centrus. In November 2023, Centrus announced its first delivery of 20 kilograms of HALEU uranium hexafluoride (UF6), completing Phase 1 of the HALEU Operation Contract under budget and ahead of schedule. Centrus has so far achieved cumulative deliveries to the DOE of approximately 135 kilograms of HALEU. However, this is not enough.",
            "“We feel very confident that there will be multiple enrichers making HALEU in the United States in the future,” said Navin. “The question is how quickly they will be put in place for us to meet our initial core load for our first reactor. We just need more centrifuges spinning as quickly as possible to increase the amount of HALEU that’s commercially available.”"

The site is well known for its first reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I), which started operations in December 1951. EBR-I was the first nuclear reactor to produce usable amounts of electricity. The reactor was also novel in that it used a liquid metal coolant and operated using a fast neutron spectrum that enabled demonstration of nuclear fuel breeding, a key concept for maximizing uranium resource use. Over the ensuing decades, 52 reactors were operated on the site establishing the technical and scientific basis that underpins the safe operation of our current commercial reactors as well as for the development of future advanced reactor concepts.

Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",
            "In March, NRC issued new guidance documents to facilitate the licensing of non-light water reactor designs. The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies. DOE said this was good news for advanced reactor vendors, including two DOE demonstration projects with TerraPower and X-energy. Both companies are applying this guidance to their construction permit applications. Both projects are being managed through DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.",
            "TerraPower has received significant and constant DOE support for its Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D that resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University.",
            "In 2019, the MCFR design team reported a major milestone with 1,000 hours of isothermal loop operations. The MCFR technology will utilise liquid salt as both fuel and coolant in the reactor core. This fully pumped molten salt loop tested key components including pumps, heaters, freeze valves, flanges, and instrumentation over time.",
            "In 2020, DOE selected the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) proposal, with Southern Company as the lead, as a winner of the ARDP risk-reduction pathway. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology. In February 2022, TerraPower and Southern Company finalised an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE at Idaho National Laboratory under the ARDP.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years.",
            "The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030. Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more than 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.”",
            "Nevertheless, US PacifiCorp, owner of the Kemmerer site, in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) considered the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities. TerraPower says it remains confident that the US supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035.",

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued new guidance documents to facilitate the licensing of non-light water reactor designs. The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies. The US Department of Energy (DOE) said this was good news for advanced reactor vendors, including two DOE demonstration projects with TerraPower and X-energy. Both companies are applying this guidance to their construction permit applications to be submitted to the NRC within the year.",
            "NRC finalised 10 documents that will help streamline the licensing process for non-light-water reactor applicants. They include endorsement of an industry-led Technology Inclusive Content of Application Project (TICAP) to deliver a more technology-inclusive review of the safety analysis report. The documents also include NRC’s public release of interim staff guidance on the project to give applicants and interested members of the public a transparent look at the licensing process.",
            "The new guidance places added emphasis on the parts of the design and its operation that most directly affect safety and is seen as an important step to establishing an efficient and cost-effective approach to licensing non-light water reactors.",
            "“I’d like to thank our industry partners, led by Southern Company Services, along with DOE, and the NRC for achieving this milestone,” said Jason Andrus, the national technical director of TICAP from Idaho National Laboratory. “Endorsement of this guidance allows for a more efficient and clear licensing application and review process for advanced reactors by focusing on what’s most important – safety.”",
            "The TICAP endorsement is the direct result of a six-year collaboration between industry, NRC, DOE, and the national labs to support the near-term deployment of new reactor technologies. TICAP is part of a larger NRC-led project to provide guidance on all of the topics needed in applications for construction permits, operating licenses, manufacturing licences, standard design approvals, design certifications, and combined licences.",
            "Both projects build on the licensing modernisation project (LMP), supported by DOE and led by industry, to provide a risk-informed, performance-based approach for licensing new reactors that is aligned with the Nuclear Energy Innovation & Modernization Act mandated by Congress.",
            "NRC anticipates several licence applications from non-light water designs over the next five years – including TerraPower’s sodium-cooled fast reactor that will be built near a retiring coal plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming and X-energy's high-temperature gas reactor that will provide process heat in the form of steam for a Dow-owned chemical plant in Seadrift, Texas. Both projects are being managed through DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and plan to implement the LMP framework and new TICAP guidance endorsed by the NRC.",

            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report: ‘",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets",
            "’ which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector’s progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale’s pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance.",
            "It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale’s VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "Above: Relative latecomers are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium being developed by Bill Gates’ TerraPower",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector’s early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

HD Hyundai has been working on SMRs with global nuclear power leaders since February, after it invested $30m in TerraPower in 2022.",
            "“We are very excited about the launch of NEMO as it can serve as a cornerstone to advance the era of offshore nuclear power,” said Mamdouh el-Shanawany, former head of IAEA’s Safety Division, who will serve as NEMO’s inaugural chair. “We will expand the participation of global organisations that share vision and values with us.”",
            "“Establishing global standards holds the key to the commercialisation of next-generation SMRs well suited to the maritime environment,” said Park Sang-min, head of the Green Energy Research Lab at HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE – a subsidiary of HD Hyundai), who will serve as a steering committee member of NEMO. “Through the establishment of NEMO, we will lead the world in shipbuilding and nuclear power.”",

            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",
            "Much greater technological detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. The 424 pages provide data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. However, this depends largely on information from the designers. Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines."

            "US-based Kairos Power has signed a technology investment agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) to put into effect the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ADRP) risk reduction award, which the company received in 2020. Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303m on a performance-based, fixed-price milestone basis to enable the design, construction, and commissioning of the company’s Hermes demonstration reactor. A construction permit for the reactor was issued by the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in December 2023.",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s. Hermes is to be built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",
            "Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO, noted: “With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.”",
            "DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Assistant Secretary Dr Kathryn Huff said the Hermes reactor “is an important step toward realising advanced nuclear energy’s role in ushering forward the nation’s clean energy transition”. She added: “Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.”",
            "The KP-HFR is one of five teams selected in 2020 by the DOE to receive $30m in initial funding for risk reduction projects under the ARDP. The other projects were Westinghouse Electric Company’s eVinci Microreactor, the BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR), Holtec’s SMR-160 Reactor, and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment. DOE had earlier in 2020 selected TerraPower and X-energy to receive $160m in initial funding for ARDP Demonstration projects to develop two advanced nuclear reactors to be operational within seven years.",

            "Netherlands-based nuclear energy development and consultancy company ULC-Energy has undertaken a study that investigated the potential to use civil nuclear technologies to power commercial maritime vessels. The study was commissioned by mining company and shipping charterer BHP, a major producer of commodities including iron ore, copper, nickel, and metallurgical coal. BHP has approximately 80,000 employees and contractors, primarily in Australia and the Americas.",
            "The study compared key characteristics of various civil reactor designs against the requirements for potential use in commercial maritime shipping. It evaluated a range of regulatory, operational, and commercial challenges such as port access, licensing and vessel classification, capital costs, and crew training & certification.",
            "ULC-Energy says decarbonising the shipping industry is a formidable challenge in the pursuit of more sustainable transportation. Some of the methods employed to date have focused on energy efficiency by using larger ships, improved hull designs, and streamlined operations. In addition, parts of the maritime industry have explored the adoption of alternative fuels such as LNG, methanol, and ammonia. Nuclear energy emerges as a promising alternative to be considered in the mix. It offers the potential for longer range, faster transits, and the reduction of refuelling requirements, while maintaining near-zero greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "On the other hand, the use of nuclear energy would require material changes, including overcoming technical challenges, updating regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance with international regulations, and restructuring operations. ULC-Energy CEO Dirk Rabelink says civil nuclear solutions could be a reliable and cost-effective alternative to other marine fuel options. “However, it’s not straightforward nor easy – and it will require a range of stakeholders to cooperate to make civil nuclear marine solutions possible.”",
            "BHP Vice President of Maritime & Supply Chain Excellence Rashpal Bhatti welcomed the opportunity to support the study by ULC-Energy. “BHP values the importance of partnerships in identifying a range of pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime sector,” he said.",

Two Taymyr class vessels (Project 10580) were commissioned from 1987 to 1989. The current class of icebreakers (Project 22220) will replace the previous Arktika and Taymyr-classes. So far three vessels have been completed and an additional four are planned. In parallel, construction is underway of a new class of vessel (Project 10510), the first of which is due for commissioning in 2027>. In addition, the Sevmorput, a nuclear-powered cargo ship was commissioned in 1988 and is still operating.",
            "The past few years have also seen a flood of designs for floating NPPs using small modular reactors. To date, the only operational purpose-built floating NPP is Rosatom’s 70 MWe/58 MWt Akademik Lomonosov moored at Pevek in Chukotka in the Russian Arctic Russia’s Far East, which began supplying heat and power to the region in May 2020. Rosatom is in the process of building several more for Artic industrial sites. These use the reactors originally developed for icebreakers."

            "Advanced nuclear technologies could form an integral part of the solution to reconcile the need for clean energy with energy security; this is the conclusion of a new report from Charles River Associates (CRA). The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.",
            "CRA’s report, titled: ‘Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival’ further says: “The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.”",
            "Addressing investment challenges",
            "The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.",
            "Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale’s Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: “The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren’t what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you’re grounded in the best technological positions.”",
            "Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: “In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.”",
            "that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: “The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren’t yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.”",
            "Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: “There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they’re undertaking.”",
            "However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. “The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it’s very much hinged on policy sentiment.” Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: “The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.",
            "Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. “Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.”",
            "Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.",
            "Kotak adds: “It’s exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they’re working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.”",
            "Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.",
            "The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: “Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they’re all being predicated on the fact that they’re trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that’s a positive.",
            "A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.",
            "Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.",
            "The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.",
            "“There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There’s a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,” she says.",
            "The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.",
            "Canada’s introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a ‘fundamental and necessary component’ of the low-carbon energy system.",
            "In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada’s federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.",
            "As Kotak says: “Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It’s only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.”",
            "The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project.",
            "Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH’s BWRX-300 SMR for the project.",
            "Kotak picks up on these developments: “It’s great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.”",
            "The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a ‘Nuclear Alliance’ consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe’s energy goals.",
            "In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament’s recent approval of the Government’s nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France’s ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country’s electricity mix.",
            "The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH’s BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.",
            "Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.",
            "“We’re seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates’ TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,” says Kotak.",
            "Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: “Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market.” She adds: “The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources – nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal – need to be considered.”",
            "The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.",
            "“From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn’t taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,” says Kotak.",
            "Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: “Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals.” As Kotak concludes: “As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we’ve seen with other energy sources.”"

        "text": [
            "Over the last several years evidence has been mounting that a large expansion of nuclear energy capacity is indispensable for keeping global warning within 1.5°C limits. Multiple studies have confirmed that, contrary to the claims by “all-renewables” zealots, no single group of technologies can enable a timely and cost-efficient energy transition, and a diversified energy mix of low-carbon sources, including both intermittent renewables and nuclear, is needed to achieve net-zero by 2050. The most recent estimates suggest that the global nuclear energy installed capacity needs to increase 2.5-3 times from the current 370 GW to between 916 GWe and 1,160 GW by 2050.",
            "To offset the retirement of the aging existing fleet, new global capacity additions over the next 25 years need to reach between 800-1,000 GWe, averaging about 30-40 GWe annually. This task is challenging, considering that the average new global capacity additions over the past decade stood at approximately 6.5 GWe per year, almost six times less than the target. While the majority of expected growth will likely come from conventional, GW-sized reactors connected to centralised grids in BRICS and other large emerging economies, between 10% and one-third of the additions are expected to come from small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "In December 2023, the New Nuclear Watch Institute (NNWI), a London-based think tank, published a report:",
            "Scaling Success: Navigating the Future of Small Modular Reactors in Competitive Global Low Carbon Energy Markets’",
            "which emphasises the pivotal role of SMRs in achieving global net-zero targets and underscores the urgency for accelerated deployment of SMRs across the globe.",
            "Despite growing interest and burgeoning number of start-ups and initiatives, the actual sector's progress in the past decades has been slower than expected. Russia's",
            ", the world’s first operational SMR-based facility launched in 2019 and stationed in Chukotka, remains the lone commercially-operational project to date. The recent cancellation of NuScale's pilot project in Utah in November 2023 further highlights the challenges SMR vendors face.",
            "According to the NNWI analysis, the very attributes making SMRs appealing – their compact size, modular construction, and flexibility – are also associated with their potential strategic vulnerabilities. While SMRs offer the promise of quicker, more economical builds and suitability for diverse grid configurations, these advantages come with higher relative costs per unit of output capacity. At the same time, market demand uncertainties, along with supply chain challenges, regulatory and political risks, complicate the scaling of modular production, a key factor in driving down costs.",
            "SMR projects are entering a very competitive market. Internally, the competition arises among different SMR designs, while externally, especially in the on-grid application segment, they face competition from other low-carbon energy sources like large reactors, utility-scale energy storage, which is advancing rapidly towards full commercialisation, advanced geothermal technologies in some parts of the world, and carbon capture and storage systems. In this context, according to the NNWI analysis, capabilities enabling a rapid scaling for SMR designs to leverage modularisation benefits and reduce costs becomes crucial. As a result, the market is expected to be dominated by first movers.",
            "Many of the SMR vendors tout significant and even potentially disruptive reduction of overnight construction cost offered by a move from the conventional pressurised water (PWR) technology, where up to half of the capital expenses is spent on safety features, to advanced, next generation technologies boasting “inherent safety”. However, according to the NNWI, the real costs of new technologies are likely to significantly exceed ex-ante estimates. Advanced SMRs, employing technologies like molten salt and high-temperature gas reactors, might face significant delays due to complex licensing and challenges in supply chain and fuel provision. Though some prototype units still may, as planned, become operational between 2030 and 2035, widespread deployment and mass production are not anticipated until around 2040.",
            "The NNWI analysis shows that factors beyond technology, such as access to low-cost capital, subsidised demand, shorter supply chain lead times, and more efficient licensing processes are vital, sometimes even more so than technological advancements in safety and performance. It highlights that learning curves, scalability, and reduced capital costs often lead to greater reductions in electricity costs than those achieved through technological innovation.",
            "According to the report, in its base-case scenario the total capacity of the global SMR fleet by 2050 will be around 150-170 GWe (up to about 300 GWe in the high case). Geographically, this distribution is expected to include approximately one-third in the United States and Canada, about one-quarter in China, and another quarter across the emerging markets of Africa, Asia, and Latin America.",
            "The report evaluates the top 25 SMR projects, chosen based on a mix of external business factors and internal technological capabilities. These 25 designs or design series, according to the NNWI, have the highest chances to be successfully deployed and capture significant market shares by mid-century. It suggests that if current trends continue, over half of the global SMR capacity by 2050 could be represented by just 6 to 8 leading designs that are the first to enter the market.",
            "The Russian RITM reactor series, benefiting from state backing and an early move into the stage of series manufacturing, is expected to capture the largest share of the global SMR fleet, representing 17-18% of its total capacity. Despite geopolitical challenges, Rosatom is likely to extend its market dominance from the large reactors’ exports segment to that of SMRs, especially in emerging markets. The Chinese Linglong One, NuScale's VOYGR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, as well as advanced reactors like the XE-100 are projected to secure significant global market shares in the coming decades. Relative latecomers, which are expected to capitalise on substantial private and public backing, like the molten salt reactor Natrium developing by Bill Gates’ TerraPower, the French NUWARD, and Rolls-Royce’s UK-SMR, as well as the group of potential disrupters, such as OKLO’s Aurora, SSR-Wasteburner, and Terrestrial Energy’s IMSR are also expected to survive the competition and win in some significant market niches.",
            "The NNWI estimates that developing 150-160 GWe of SMR capacity globally by 2050 will require an investment of around US$800-900bn, based on 2023 prices. State support and subsidies are vital in the sector's early stages before the leading designs reach the stage of full commercialisation. The sector is estimated to need about US$150bn in governmental aid and subsidies for its successful rollout over the next two decades. Although it may seem a lot, this amount is just a fraction of the amount currently spent on fossil fuel subsidies, with over US$1 trillion spent globally in 2022 alone, including coal subsidies via capacity mechanisms.",
            "Despite the challenges, SMRs remain the most economically viable, and often the only practical, option for replacing coal in decentralised grids, district heating, and industrial applications. If pursuing net-zero is a genuine goal, prioritising the replacement of coal and diesel generation with SMRs is essential. The world requires an initiative akin to the Marshall Plan to assist the most carbon-intensive regions in transitioning from aging coal-fired plants to SMRs."

            "The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has signed another memorandum of understanding (MOUs) related to small modular reactors at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the original 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai. The latest agreement is with Terrestrial Energy, signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish.",
            "This followed previous agreements with US-based small modular reactor (SMR) and micro-reactor developers X-energy, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), TerraPower and Westinghouse Electric as well as with UK-based developer of molten salt nuclear technology MoltexFLEX.",
            "The agreements came after ENEC launched its ADVANCE programme, in the run up to CO28, aimed at leveraging the UAE’s experience in successfully delivering the four-unit Barakah NPP, constructed in Abu Dhabi by a South Korean consortium. ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "Terresrial is developing an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant. The IMSR is a 442 MWt per Core-unit (IMSR400) small modular molten salt fuelled, graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactor. Terrestrial Energy has developed a two-unit configuration which can deliver 884 MWt/390 MWe. The design features a completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers and shutdown rods all mounted inside a single vessel – the IMSR core-unit. The sealed core-unit is replaced completely at the end of its useful service life (nominally seven years). This allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. Terrestrial says it operates at the high temperature required for broad industrial relevance with transformative economic potential.",
            "ENEC and Terrestrial Energy will collaborate to focus on the potential of IMSR plant for electricity generation and for large-scale industrial heat applications. These uses include the IMSR plant’s role in decarbonising energy-intensive and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The parties will also consider frameworks for development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications in the UAE and other markets.",
            "H.E. Mohamed Al Hammadi commented: “We are committed to exploring the latest technologies in advanced reactors as we continue to rapidly decarbonise the power sector through clean electricity from nuclear energy…. We look forward to close collaboration with Terrestrial Energy as we identify the potential deployment of IMSR technology in the UAE and overseas.”",
            "Simon Irish said the IMSR has immense potential to support industrial growth and decarbonisation. “Terrestrial Energy’s prioritisation of national and international regulatory requirements supports the aims of our MOU as does the IMSR’s use of nuclear fuel at standard enrichment levels, which has long-established international acceptance. We look forward to working with ENEC to accelerate development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications and commercial markets.”",
            "In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against Canadian regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.",
            "The conventional nuclear power plant fuel used by the IMSR – Standard Assay Low Enriched Uranium – is the only fuel available and transportable today for civilian reactor use and has international regulatory acceptance. Its use supports an early deployment path for IMSR plants across multiple markets. In August 2023, Terrestrial Energy signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a UK-based subsidiary of Westinghouse, for the design and construction of an IMSR fuel pilot plant."

            "Levesque said TerraPower and ENEC are leading the way in deploying nuclear plants, “and this agreement allows us to share our expertise and design experience and explore the opportunity for deployment of Natrium reactors around the world, including additional locations in the United States”.",
            "The MOU also opens the door for ENEC to lead a broader regional deployment of TerraPower's Natrium technology across the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinental regions. “The aim will be to jointly accelerate the commercialisation and global deployment of Natrium technology under licensing agreements with TerraPower and within the framework of the existing US-UAE PACE programme, TerraPower noted.",
            "The MOU with Westinghouse was signed by Al Hammadi, and Westinghouse President & CEO Patrick Fragman, to explore potential opportunities for technical and commercial deployment of the eVinci microreactor both in the UAE and overseas. Al Hammadi said it would enable ENEC “to assess the positive potential impact of eVinci microreactors, to accelerate global clean energy transitions”. Fragman noted that the eVinci technology “can be truly transformative to the UAE”. Westinghouse acknowledged that the agreement was enabled by PACE. ENEC said the agreement “will involve the potential use of ENEC project delivery know-how and experience as well as inclusion of nuclear-graded UAE companies as suppliers within the nation”.",

            "US-based TerraPower has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the UAE’s Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) on the sidelines of COP28 to explore opportunities for the commercialisation and global deployment of Terrapower’s Natrium technology. “Bringing advanced nuclear technologies to market is critical to meeting global decarbonisation targets,” said TerraPower President & CEO Chris Levesque. “TerraPower and ENEC are leading the way in deploying nuclear plants, and this agreement allows us to share our expertise and design experience, and explore the opportunity for deployment of Natrium reactors around the world including additional locations in the United States.”",
            "TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are developing the Natrium technology, which features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. According to Terrapower, this “allows a Natrium plant to integrate seamlessly with renewable resources and leads to faster, more cost-effective decarbonisation of the electric grid while producing dispatchable carbon-free energy”. The first Natrium plant is being developed in the US in Kemmerer, Wyoming, near a retiring coal plant and is planned to enter operation within a decade. Development of the first Natrium demonstration plant is supported by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",
            "The UAE has a strong civil nuclear programme which began operation in 2020. Construction of its Barakah NPP began in 2011. Korea Electric Power Company (Kepco) led the consortium that is building the plant comprising four APR1400 reactors. To date three units have been connected to the grid and unit 4 completed hot functional testing in July 2023 in preparation for commercial operation in 2024.",
            "ENEC Managing Director & CEO Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, said nuclear is at the heart of UAE’s clean energy progress and strategy. “Our new agreement with TerraPower will facilitate cooperation in taking nuclear energy technology to the next level, by accelerating its deployment and its use for innovating new solutions including the production of clean molecules and hydrogen.”",
            "TerraPower founder and Chairman Bill Gates attended the MOU signing ceremony along with David Livingston, Senior Advisor & Managing Director for Energy for the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate along with other US Government officials. Terrapower the agreement helps advance the US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and aims to help catalyse $100bn in clean energy and decarbonisation projects by 2035.",
            "A few days before, TerraPower signed an MOU with the US Uranium Energy with objectives of reestablishing domestic supply chains of uranium fuel. TerraPower and UEC will explore the potential supply of uranium for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor and energy storage system. Terrapower said small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactors represent “the fastest growing segment of nuclear energy in the United States and need a secure, domestic fuel supply chain”. The first step of the supply chain is uranium, “and UEC’s Wyoming resources have the critical mass to be a highly reliable source of uranium for American HALEU [high assay low enriched uranium] and a good strategic fit to supply TerraPower’s Natrium reactor”.",
            "Wyoming’s Governor Mark Gordon stated: “This MOU is a great step forward for the Wyoming uranium industry, which is host to the largest uranium reserves in the United States. It makes no sense to depend on Russian uranium and enrichment technology, when a fully domestic fuel source can be found here in Wyoming and manufactured in the United States.”",
            "UEC President & CEO Amir Adnani welcomed the prospect of providing the uranium needed to operate the Wyoming Natrium reactor. “In these geopolitically complex times, UEC’s vision is to be the leading provider of conflict-free, American uranium for the existing, as well as the new reactors that will come online.”",
            "UEC’s Wyoming production platform includes a portfolio of over 20 uranium projects, that in total contain the largest S-K 1300 compliant resource base in the United States. Four of the projects in the Powder River Basin are fully permitted for in-situ recovery (ISR) production including the Irigaray Central Processing Plant and Christensen Ranch ISR facilities in Johnson County, Wyoming where UEC’s initial production will be focused.",
            "In August, Terrapower selected four suppliers to support its Natrium Reactor Demonstration Project saying the contracts will help to establish key elements of the supply chain that the advanced reactor industry will require as new reactors are brought to market. In July Terrapower and US Centrus agreed to collaborate to ensure the demonstration reactor has access to HALEU to ensure that the project’s 2030 operation date can be met.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under theARDP, including two planned demonstration reactors – Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors. TerraPower and Centrus have been working together since 2021 to help expedite the commercialisation of domestic enrichment technology at Centrus’s Piketon, Ohio, facility.",
            "In December 2022, TerraPower said it expected operation of the Natrium demonstration reactor to be delayed by at least two years from 2028 to 2030 because of the lack of commercial capacity to HALEU in time to meet the proposed targets “We had a plan. It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first core load of fuel come from Russia,” Terrapower said at the time.",
            "However, even if sufficient HALEU is available, the 2030 target date may be optimistic. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. DOE in July 2022 issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades.",

        "title": "Growing uncertainty in US regarding economics of new nuclear",
        "text": [
            "A recent statement from Fitch Ratings casts doubt on any new nuclear construction in the US in the immediate future. Similar concerns were voiced during discussions at a full committee hearing of the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources to Examine Opportunities and Challenges Associated with Advanced Nuclear Reactor Commercialisation.",
            "Fitch noted that without “broader joint action, improved cost competitiveness and/or greater certainty of cost and delivery, most US public power systems are unlikely to pursue new nuclear construction over the next few years, and those that do face the risk of weakened credit quality”.",
            "The recent announcement by the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and NuScale Power to terminate their Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) illustrates the challenges facing public power systems as they consider new nuclear construction, Fitch said. “The project was unable to attract interest from enough purchasers to continue development, despite the plant's modular design, improved safety measures and the offer of low-cost government funding, likely due to schedule delays and cost concerns.”",
            "Interest in new nuclear generation “should remain piqued as a result of proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants, as well as widening concerns about the effects of climate change and more aggressive carbon-free energy standards”. However, “until the cost of new construction can be assured through insurance or guarantees provided by the US government or highly creditworthy entities, widespread ownership agreements can broadly distribute and limit project exposure, and new design construction is proven to be both feasible and replicable, these risks will remain formidable barriers to participation”.",
            "Fitch noted that nuclear projects “are large, costly and complex, and developers have a historically poor record of completing new projects on time and within budget”. The agency cited the projects launched at the Summer and Vogtle nuclear stations in 2013 that were “plagued by scheduling delays, fabrication challenges, labour shortages and significant cost overruns almost from the beginning of construction”. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) completed its Watts Bar unit 2 in 2016 after work was suspended in 1985 and resumed in 2007, Fitch said. “However, the final cost was roughly $2bn higher than initially planned.” It was only the operational breadth and financial strength of TVA allowed that the utility to absorb the costs and maintain its then current ratings.",
            "Meanwhile, the US Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee hearing chaired by Joe Manchin discussed opportunities for advanced nuclear considering federal support from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, commercialisation challenges and the need to onshore nuclear energy supply chains.",
            "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $2.4bn to support competitive Department of Energy (DOE) awards for advanced reactor demonstration projects at commercial scale. The IRA provided ten years of certainty to commercialise advanced reactors through a 30% investment tax credit or $25/MWh production tax credit for new nuclear plants, along with making tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees available for nuclear projects, said Chairman Manchin, opening the hearing. “The IRA incentives were not just about building power plants, but also securing our nuclear supply chain. Congress provided $700m for High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is the fuel that most advanced nuclear technologies need, including Pele, Terrapower, and X-Energy.”",
            "However, “despite all of the federal and private sector support, we’re witnessing struggles and hesitancy in getting advanced nuclear projects off the ground”, he said. There are large design, cost, and regulatory uncertainties associated with first-of-a-kind nuclear technology, he added, which is why numerous federal programmes were put in place to help reduce these risks. “But someone will need to go first, and unfortunately many of the utilities I’ve spoken with won’t get in the game until others have done it first. We also must continue to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent judiciously and we’re managing risks – and learning from instances like the NuScale project with UAMPS, which fell far short of our expectations.”",
            "Manchin also commented on the need to offset China and Russia’s growing influence on international nuclear energy development. “We must push back and they cannot succeed. To regain our civil nuclear leadership, we need to demonstrate domestically that we can develop and deploy the next generation of nuclear energy to attract our international partners. We also need to export these technologies to our allies and partners to help reduce their energy dependence on foreign adversaries.”",
            "He also discussed Russia’s dominance over the nuclear fuel supply chain. “Currently, Russia is the only commercial supplier of HALEU, the fuel used for our DOD [Defence Department] micro-reactor project, DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Projects, and many other advanced nuclear technologies.” The bipartisan Nuclear Fuel Security Act of 2023 “authorises a DOE programme to onshore US uranium conversion and enrichment capacity, for both traditional and advanced reactors”, said Manchin. “We must re-establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and our bill will do just that. I’ve also worked … to introduce legislation that would limit and eventually ban uranium fuel imports from Russia. Today, I’m calling on my Congressional colleagues to include these critical nuclear fuel bills and associated funding in the defence and appropriations packages we’re currently negotiating.”",
            "The committee heard witnesses from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) at the Office of the Secretary of Defence, Dow chemical company and the US Nuclear Industry Council.",
            "Dr John C Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL described the various projects underway. These included MARVEL, an 85 kW DOE test reactor; Pele, a partnership with DOD and BWXT that will utilise TRi-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel. INL, working with Southern Company and TerraPower also plans to conduct the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE), which “will become the world’s first fast spectrum salt reactor experiment to achieve criticality”. These first three systems will be authorised for operation under DOE authority, as opposed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing. The first planned NRC-licensed reactor on the INL site is the Oklo Aurora microreactor in 2027. INL intends to use existing reactor facilities as test beds for reactor demonstrations via the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) to streamline testing, demonstration, and, ultimately, deployment of advanced reactors into the market.",
            "“We are making steady progress, said Wagner. “But we cannot rest easy, as the recent ending of the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) Carbon Free Power Project shows. The era of constructing paper reactors must end. We have to identify our challenges, address, and overcome them. We need to accelerate the systems and build the supply chains needed to rapidly develop and deploy advanced technologies at scale, in our nation and around the world. The project did not end because of technical flaws [but] was suspended because of economics.”",
            "He added: “We cannot abdicate our world leadership in nuclear energy development and deployment. When we build new systems – and export our technologies, materials, and services – we also export our values. A nuclear power plant is designed to operate for six to eight decades. When a country sells a nuclear reactor to another nation, it begins what can be a century-long relationship that encompasses many areas.”",
            "Countries will look for developers who can quickly, safely, affordably, and effectively develop a reactor and get it deployed. “And because U.S. developers are not competing on equal terms, too many of these nations will turn to China, Russia or our friends in South Korea. This presents not just a missed opportunity, but in the case of Russian and Chinese expansion, a danger to US national security.” INL is also working to supply HALEU from DOE-owned materials. “But our lack of domestic fuel cycle capabilities is already hurting efforts to deploy the next generation of technologies needed to allow our commercial fleet to produce 24/7, carbon-free power more than 93% of the time,” Wagner noted.",
            "Optimistic presentations were made by Dr Jeff Waksman SCO Program Manager, about projects being developed by DOD and Edward Stones Vice President, Energy & Climate at Dow about its planned project with X-Energy. However, Jeffrey S Merrifield, a former Commissioner at NRC and Chairman of the Advanced Nuclear Working Group of the US Nuclear Industry Council was more circumspect",
            "He acknowledged that companies such as Dow, Microsoft, Google and Nucor were all considering how nuclear energy to meet their energy needs. These companies share is a large balance sheet and conduct extensive infrastructure design and construction. “Thus, they are not deterred by the additional complexity and patience that comes with the deployment of nuclear power.” However, apart from large state-owned or quasi state-owned utilities, including Ontario Power Generation in Canada and Tennessee Valley Authority other power utilities are hesitant.",
            "“Financial markets and public utility commissions have viewed what is admittedly a tortuous path that it took to get Southern Company’s Vogtle units 3-4 online and the failure of the VC Summer project and have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to repeat that example. Despite the provision of government-backed loan guarantees and other federal tax incentives that are intended to jump start the order process, utility executives … have a variety of built-in incentives for not jumping to the front of the line.",
            "What utilities fear the most is that they will commit to building a first-of-a-kind plant and that there will be financial and timing risk on the back end of the project that could put the utility at economic risk.”",
            "He proposed further support from the federal government and Congress , noting: “As a nation, our skills at building very large infrastructure projects, to put it politely, are ‘rusty’ and we need to have additional investment in university-based engineering programmes.” He added: “Some of the capabilities needed to build new nuclear units either don’t exist or have limited options in the US. While some of these come from friendly nuclear supplier countries such as South Korea and Japan, the vast potential for new nuclear deployment certainly begs the question as to why more of this supply of components can’t be fabricated and built in the US.”",
            "To achieve the economies of scale needed to efficiently and cost effectively manufacture multiple lines of small modular reactors (SMRs), further incentives will be necessary."

            "The Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR), and US-based TerraPower have expanded their January 2022 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the development of sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) technologies.",
            "Japan's government in December 2018 adopted a strategic roadmap for fast reactor development whereby it would assess the efficacy of various types of fast reactors following a technological competition among private-sector corporations. The roadmap was revised in December 2022, at which time two decisions were taken. The first was to select a SFR as the basis of the conceptual design of the demonstration reactor to begin in fiscal 2024. The second was to select a manufacturer as the core company in charge of the design and R&D in accordance with the goals and policy directions established by the government.",
            "In July, MHI was selected by the Japanese government to lead the conceptual design of a demonstration 650 MWe pool-type, SFR for operation in the 2040s. MHI is to oversee both the conceptual design as well as research and development for the reactor in partnership with MFBR. It is hoped that the concept will be finalised by around 2030.",
            "Under the expanded MOU, TerraPower and Japan will consider collaborating on a common reactor design concept, based on the Japan's FR demonstration programme and TerraPower's existing technologies. This MOU has been revised to include an increase in size for Terrapower’s Natrium design to improve cost competitiveness and metal fuel safety.",
            "TerraPower is currently developing its 345 MWe Natrium reactor design in the US supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP). The first Natrium plant aims to begin commercial operations in 2030. The company has selected Kemmerer in Wyoming as the preferred site for the Natrium demonstration project, which will feature a SFR with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is designed to temporarily boost the system's output to 500 MWe when needed, enabling the plant to follow daily electric load changes and integrate seamlessly with fluctuating renewable resources.",
            "\"We are thrilled to expand our collaboration with JAEA as Japan works to bring advanced nuclear reactors to market,\" said TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque. \"In order to achieve our climate goals, countries across the world are going to need to deploy advanced reactors starting in the 2030s, and this agreement will help us evaluate the design opportunities for large-scale Natrium plants that can support Japan's carbon targets.\"",
            "Japan's Strategic Roadmap for FR technology identifies the SFR as one of the most promising technologies and emphasises the importance of international cooperation. JAEA President Masanori Koguchi said, JAEA will play a role as one of organisations in the strategic roadmap for fast reactor development. “For effective development, we believe that international cooperation is one of the key issues,” he said. “We will promote Japan-US collaboration on FR development through this expanded MOU.\"",
            "MHI Executive Vice President Akihiko Kato said, \"MHI group, as the core company in charge of design and development of the Japanese demonstration fast reactor, will steadily proceed in accordance with the strategic roadmap. We would like to contribute to fast reactor development cooperation between the US and Japan by utilising the technology and experience we have cultivated over many years.\"",
            "Japan’s experience with fast reactors has been problematic. In June, the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) approved a screening report concluding that the JAEA’s Joyo experimental fast reactor had met new regulatory standards, which were a prerequisite for its restart. A period of public consultation followed. JAEA is hoping to restart Joyo, located in the town of Oarai, Ibaraki Prefecture, at the end of fiscal 2024. The sodium-cooled fast reactor began operation in 1977, and is Japan’s only operational fast reactor since the closure of Monju in 2016.",

It was restarted in 2010 but was shut down three months later after a fuel handling machine was accidentally dropped into the reactor during a refuelling outage. Joyo was shut down in 2007 after a test sub-assembly became jammed in the reactor vessel Special equipment had to be designed to retrieve it, which finally took place in 2014.",

            "Researchers at the US Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory (INL) have performed a new experiment that shows what happens to nuclear fuel when there is a loss of coolant accident. This is the first such test in the US in more than 35 years Previously similar experiments were only available in Russia.",
            "INL has developed a specialised experiment holder that can be loaded into its Transient Reactor Test (TREAT) Facility. The new “TWIST” capsule is designed to hold a fuel sample that is surrounded by water, which can be rapidly drained during testing.",
            "The TWIST experiment is paired with TREAT’s transient pulses. These are short, sudden bursts of energy five times more powerful than a commercial reactor, that can simulate loss of coolant accident (LOCA) conditions in a controlled environment.",
            "DOE says data collected from the experiment will help industry assess fuel performance, answer regulatory questions, and develop new fuel technologies. “Loss of coolant accident testing is essential to developing new fuels that will boost the performance of our nuclear power plants and help them run more efficiently,” said Bill McCaughey, Director of Advanced Fuel Technologies at DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy. “Bringing this testing capability back to the US ensures the timely deployment of accident tolerant fuels that our industry has worked so hard to develop.”",
            "All US NPPs are light water reactors that use water to cool their cores. A LOCA could occur if water rushes out of the reactor faster than it can be replaced, causing significant damage to system. LOCA testing is a key part of assessing the behaviour of nuclear fuels and materials. It ensures that the equipment maintains its intended safety function under this scenario.",
            "The US lost the ability to perform LOCA tests when its Power Burst Facility shut down at INL in the mid-1980s. To bridge this testing gap, the US worked with Norway to conduct fuel safety tests at the Halden Boiling Water Reactor. When that reactor closed in 2018, LOCA testing was only possible at a Russian test reactor. INL then made modifications to TREAT to accommodate a larger experiment rig that can be used by TWIST and future experiments at the facility.",
            "The TREAT facility operated from 1959 to 1994, when it was placed in standby mode. A resurgence of interest in developing innovative nuclear technologies has driven demand for transient testing. TREAT was restarted in 2017 and modified to enable it to provides transient testing of nuclear fuels and materials. The facility is now used to study fuel melting behaviour, interactions between fuel and coolant, and the potential for propagation of failure to adjacent fuel pins under conditions ranging from mild upsets to severe accidents.",
            "The larger rig will also be used for upcoming sodium loop tests to support the development of TerraPower’s Natrium small modular reactor. The TREAT facility will also house DOE’s MARVEL microreactor. The sodium-potassium-cooled microreactor is expected to be operational in 2025 and will be used to advance small reactor technologies.",

            "Since installation of the IET at TerraPower’s laboratory in Everett, Washington in October 2022, the project team has completed mechanical, electrical and controls verification and commissioned all systems. The IET is a non-nuclear, externally heated, up to 1 MW multi-loop system – the world’s largest chloride salt system developed by the nuclear sector – and follows years of separate effects testing. The IET aims to inform the design, licensing and operation of an approximately 180 MW MCFR demonstration planned for the early 2030s.",
            "The project was initiated by Southern Company and TerraPower under the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Concepts (ARC-15) award, a multi-year effort to promote the design, construction and operation of Generation-IV nuclear reactors. ARC-15 involves a total project investment of $76m based on a 60-40% public-private cost share.",

The IET also supports the development and operation of the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment at INL, a proof-of-concept critical fast-spectrum salt reactor. At less than 200 kW, the reactor will provide experimental and operational data.",
            "Commissioning of the IET employed hot argon and chloride salts to confirm readiness, including filling and flushing of drain tanks and verifying operation of freeze valves – a unique and important component for salt systems. Chloride salt has now been loaded into the primary coolant salt loops and pumped-salt operations have begun. A multi-month test campaign will provide valuable salt operations data and know-how for the MCFR programme.",

The IET will help us gather and evaluate data to support the development of our technology, and we are excited to launch pumped-salt operations.”",
            "Mikal Bøe, President and CEO of Core Power described the start-up of the IET as “a milestone achievement in the development of the first fast-spectrum molten salt reactor”.

        "text": [
            "HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE) and Kepco Engineering & Construction Company (Kepco E&C) have received approval in principle (AIP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for a new design of a floating offshore nuclear power barge. HD KSOE’s design involves a 240 MW SMR-powered ship, featuring four sets of 60 MW SMRs. The vessel would be a floating SMR facility on the sea, with the SMR placed on the bottom and a platform on top that produces carbon-free fuel such as hydrogen.",
            "Project collaborators include ABS, HD KSOE, Kepco E&C and the Liberian International Ship & Corporate Registry (LISCR). THE AIP presentation took place in Washington DC. The floating small modular reactor (SMR) barge is intended to serve as offshore power generation for remote communities and island electrification.",
            "HD KSOE will provide basic designs for the marine systems. ABS and LISCR will complete design reviews based on class and statutory requirements while Kepco E&C works on risk assessments for future applications.",
            "Patrick Ryan, ABS Senior Vice President & Chief Technology Officer. “Modern nuclear technologies are increasingly suggested as a potential solution to lower carbon emissions. Floating production platforms like this barge from HD KSOE have the possibility to scale more easily than what can be done on land. ABS is proud to apply our research and experience to innovative projects such as this one.”",
            "Dr Moon Young-Tae, Senior Director of Kepco E&C noted that the company had developed the APR1400 NPP which had received design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2019 and has designed more than 30 NPPs in Korea and abroad over the past 40 years. “In addition, we have our own marine SMR, ‘Bandi’, and we are making efforts to develop marine SMR technology as well as onshore SMRs,” he said.",
            "“This barge design not only eliminates the inconvenience of selecting onshore sites by being installed at sea but also offers the advantage of an integrated design for thermal energy production. This increases the potential to support the production of eco-friendly ship fuels like ammonia or methanol,” said Dr Kim Sung-Jun, Director of Future Technology at HD KSOE. He also noted that HD KSOE has invested $30m in US-based TerraPower, and that the company plans to accelerate development of future nuclear-powered ships by establishing an SMR research team.",

            "Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO of Microsoft says the company is looking for a Principal Program Manager, Nuclear Technology, who will be responsible for maturing and implementing a global Small Modular Reactor (SMR) and microreactor energy strategy.",
            "“The next major wave of computing is being born, as the Microsoft Cloud turns the world’s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform,” he said. “We are committed to helping our customers use our platforms and tools to do more with less today and innovate for the future in the new era of AI [artificial intelligence].”",
            "The position is tasked with leading the technical assessment for the integration of SMRs and microreactors to power the data centres that the Microsoft Cloud and AI reside on. The manager “will maintain a clear and adaptable roadmap for the technology’s integration, diligently select and manage technology partners and solutions, and constantly evaluate the business implications of progress and implementation”, Microsoft noted.",
            "The ideal candidate will have experience in the energy industry and a deep understanding of nuclear technologies and regulatory affairs. The role “will also be responsible for research and developing other precommercial energy technologies”. The manager “must be able to identify and partner with other groups to achieve joint or complimentary goals”. A proven track record of successfully managing projects, driving contractual improvements through service agreements and lower cost “are skillsets needed to be demonstrated, resulting in measurable impact to be successful in this role”.",
            "Requirements include a bachelor’s degree and more than six years' experience in nuclear industry, engineering, energy market, or related roles or equivalent experience. Microsoft says the typical base pay range for this role across the US is $133,600 – $256,800 a year.",
            "In January, Microsoft announced a multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment in OpenAI. Microsoft’s co-founder Bill Gates is also Chairman of the board of TerraPower, a nuclear innovation company in the process of developing and scaling various SMR designs. However, TerraPower “does not currently have any agreements to sell reactors to Microsoft,” a spokesperson told CNBC.",
            "In 2022, Microsoft procured Clean Energy Credits (CECs) from Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) to power its data centres. The credits include power from traditional nuclear sources, but could expand to include CECs from OPG’s planned future deployment of SMRs."

        "text": [
            "US-based BWX Technologies (BWXT) has signed a two-phase, two-year contract with the US Wyoming Energy Authority (WEA) to assess the viability of deploying small-scale nuclear reactors in the state. BWXT said it will execute the contract in close consultation with the State of Wyoming and other Wyoming organisations and companies.",
            "Under the first phase one of the contract, BWXT “will work with Wyoming industries to define the requirements basis for nuclear applications of base heat and power needs of the trona mining operations within the state”. In addition, BWXT will undertake engineering work to further the design of its integrated BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR) system that can integrate into Wyoming’s future power needs. The BANR design is a 50 MWt high-temperature gas-cooled microreactor that will use TRISO (TRIstructural-ISOtropic) fuel.",
            "According to the BWXT website, the BANR project “is developing a modular, factory-fabricated system that is small and light enough to be transported via rail, ship or truck and that can deliver 50 MW of thermal nuclear reactor power”. It employs “mature and manufacturable high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR) technology with inherent safety features and a high working fluid temperature”. It offers flexible options for energy output – including electricity, steam for process heat, or both (cogeneration) while minimising greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "BWXT says: “The primary objective of our programme is to demonstrate the commercial viability of this small, versatile, advanced nuclear demonstration reactor within seven years by optimising our existing high technology readiness level HTGR baseline design.” Tasks include “designing, building, testing and licensing technological upgrades to our baseline solution, leading to commercialising a BANR-inspired Advanced Nuclear Reactor”. The three project goals are listed as: qualification of novel TRISO fuel form; cost reductions; and commercialisation.",
            "Phase One of the contract with WEA will also include “identifying areas where Wyoming’s existing supply chain can demonstrate capabilities for reactor component manufacturing and support reactor deployment”. Depending on the results of Phase One, the second phase of the contract will see BWXT furthering the design basis of BANR to meet the specific needs of potential Wyoming end users. A demonstration of the capabilities of Wyoming manufacturers will be undertaken to validate the supply chain activities completed in Phase One.",
            "BWXT says that, during both phases of the contract, it will leverage existing U. Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) achievements through the company’s collaboration with Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and other internal BWXT research and development investments., BWXT and DOE have been developing the BANR microreactor through ARDP since 2021. The project in Wyoming “represents an acceleration of BWXT’s commercial nuclear development efforts”, the company notes.",
            "“At the end of this project, the potential job-creation, manufacturing and industrial opportunities for nuclear power in Wyoming will be clearer, and we will have a roadmap for deploying microreactors in the state,” said Joe Miller, BWXT Advanced Technologies President. “When state and federal agencies work together with the private sector, we expect the economic and environmental benefits of nuclear innovations will be unlocked.”",
            "INL has been providing strategic and technical support to the State of Wyoming under a memorandum of understanding signed in May 2022. “BWXT and the State of Wyoming are leaders in forging innovative partnerships and innovative business frameworks that will help transform Wyoming’s economy and help secure the nation’s energy future,” said Steven Aumeier, senior advisor for INL’s strategic programmes.",
            "WEA Executive Director Rob Creager said the microreactor project “presents the possibility of creating additional resources for industrial end users in Wyoming – thereby helping further a full value chain nuclear industry in Wyoming, advancing and diversifying our economy”. He added: “Wyoming is in the unique position to be able to contribute funding for these innovative projects and believes this further demonstrates the strength of the Wyoming Energy Authority’s public-private partnerships.”",
            "In August, BWXT's BANR project was one of two recommended by WEA to Governor Mark Gordon to receive nearly $10m each from the Energy Matching Funds programme which was established by the state legislature in 2022. This provides matching funds for research, demonstration, pilot projects or commercial deployment projects related to Wyoming’s energy needs. Management of the fund is delegated by the governor to the WEA.",
            "BWXT has 14 major operating sites in the US, Canada and the UK In addition, BWXT joint ventures provide management and operations at a dozen DOE and NASA facilities. INL, which is managed by Battelle Energy Alliance for DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, is the US centre for nuclear energy research and development, and undertakes research in DOE’s strategic goal areas of energy, national security, science and the environment.",
            "Also in Wyoming, Kemmerer was selected in 2021 as the preferred site for TerraPower's Natrium demonstration project, featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The reactor is scheduled to begin operating by 2030.",

        "text": [
            "Ikata Nuclear Power Plant. (Credit: Newsliner/Wikipedia)",
            "In recent months, nuclear power development in Asia has become the focus of growing attention. Globally, the number of nuclear reactors is increasing in Asia, while it is decreasing in Western Europe and North America. As the WNA notes: “Asia is the main region in the world where electricity generating capacity and specifically nuclear power are growing significantly. In Asia there are about 140 operable nuclear power reactors, about 30-35 under construction and firm plans to build an additional 40-50. Many more are proposed.”",
            "While this has been the trend for some time, it has accelerated in recent years, partly because of growing concerns about energy in general, following stringent Western sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. These considerations have, in some cases, even reversed the negative impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan, which saw a number of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan embark on nuclear-phase out policies.",
            "Another factor is the increasing number of small modular reactor (SMR) designs being offered to the market, encouraged by both private investment and government grants and awards. SMRs are being promoted as suitable for smaller countries that had hitherto ruled out standard NPPs as inappropriate or unaffordable.",
            "Asian countries with established nuclear power programmes or NPPs under construction include China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Bangladesh. Many others are now considering or reconsidering developing nuclear power, enticed by the promise of SMRs.",
            "In terms of operable nuclear power units, China leads Asia with 55~ ranking third worldwide. Next comes Japan with 33, but only 10 are currently operating. South Korea has 25, ranking fifth worldwide. India has 22, Pakistan six, Taiwan two and Bangladesh two under construction.",
            "China is largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western technology (from Canada, France and the US), which it is now exporting. Its 55 nuclear units at eight sites have a total capacity of 53,286 MWe. A further 23 units under construction at eight sites will add 24,296 MWe. In addition, some 45 units are planned totalling 50,110 MWe, with around 80 more firmly proposed.",
            "Three large state companies (and their subsidiaries) are responsible for NPP construction – China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and State Energy Investment Corporation (SPIC). The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are pressurised water reactors (PWRs), including the oldest unit, Qinshan 1, a 300 MWe Chinese-designed PWR, which started operating in 1991. Other technologies include pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs), high temperature gas cooled reactors (HTGRs) and fast neutron reactors (FNRs).",
            "Imported technologies include two Canadian Candu-6 PHWRs at Qinshan Phase III (Zhejiang province); French PWR M310 units at Daya Bay and Ling Ao and EPRs at Taishan (Guangdong province); Russian VVER-1000 and VVER-1200 PWRs at Tianwan (Jiangsu province) and Xudabao (Liaoning province); and US AP-1000 PWRs at Haiyang (Shandong province) and Sanmen (Zhejiang province).",
            "Indigenous development was based mainly on French M31 technology with CNNC and CGN producing slightly different versions: CNP1000, CNP600, CNP300, ACP300, ACP600, ACP1000 for CNNC; and CPR1000, M310+, ACPR1000 for CGN. The 1,000 MWe versions have now been integrated as the Hualong One (HPR1000). Three Hualong one units are already in operation in China with nine more under construction and others planned. China also adapted the US (Westinghouse) AP1000 under a technology transfer deal as the CAP1000 and CAP1400. Four CAP1000s are now under construction at sites originally planned for AP1000s.",
            "The Hualong One is China’s main export model. As yet, China has only exported NPPs to Pakistan, but the country also expects to finalise an agreement with Argentina. The UK cancelled plans for construction of a Hualong One at its Bradwell-on-Sea site largely for political reasons and China was also excluded from NPP tenders in the Czech Republic and Poland.",
            "China is also pushing ahead with SMRs and advanced reactors. CNNC’s SMR demonstration project at the Changjiang NPP (Hainan province) features the multi- purpose125 MWe ACP-100 (Linglong One) developed from the larger ACP1000 PWR. It is designed for electricity generation, urban heating and cooling, industrial steam production, or seawater desalination. Construction of the main internal structure for the reactor building has been completed. It was the first SMR project to pass an independent safety assessment by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts in 2016. In 2017, a joint venture was set up by China National Nuclear Power Co (part of CNNC) and four other domestic companies to develop and produce small, floating NPPs. Its remit was R&D, construction, operation & management and sales including possible exports.",
            "China is also building two demonstration pool-type sodium-cooled CFR-600 fast reactors in Xiapu county, Fujian province, as part of its plans to establish a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Construction of the first CFR-600 began in 2017 based on the China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) in Beijing. The CEFR was built with the assistance of Russia, which is supplying fuel for both the CEFR and CFR-600.",
            "Before the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan’s 54 reactors at 17 NPPs generated 30% of its power with plans to increase the share to 40%. All 54 were closed after the accident and new stringent safety standards were introduced by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in 2013. A total of 21 reactors were closed permanently, leaving 33 operable units totalling 31,679 MWe at 13 NPPs. As yet only 10 units (9,486 MWe) are in operation at six NPPs. Others are in the process of being reactivated or undergoing modifications to meet the new regulations with 16 awaiting regulatory approval to restart. Work stopped on two reactors that were under construction in 2011 (Shimane 3 and Ohma 1) and they are still facing delays. Japan’s NPPs all operate light water reactors (LWRs), the first of which were bought from US vendors such as General Electric and Westinghouse. Japanese companies were subcontracted to take part in construction and these were later licensed to build similar plants. Companies such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (MHI) developed the capacity to design and construct LWRs and by the late 1970s, Japan had established a domestic nuclear power industry. Currently it exports equipment worldwide and is also developing new reactor designs. MHI is designing an advanced 1200 MWe LWR (SRZ-1200) in cooperation with four EPCs (Kansai, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku.)",
            "Reactor restarts have been slower than expected. In 2022, nuclear only accounted for around 8% of electricity supply. The government’s Green Transformation (GX) strategic plan assumes that nuclear will account for 20–22% by 2030. Japan’s reactors include both PWRs, boiling water reactors (BWRs) and advanced BWRs (ABWRs). To date only PWRs have been restarted as BWRs require a filtered containment venting system, complicating the upgrades needed to meet the new regulations. Parliament recently endorsed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s policy to allow reactor operation beyond the 60-year limit set after Fukushima and to replace ageing facilities with next-generation advanced reactors.",
            "Japan had planned to use FNRs as part of a wider policy to expand the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel, with up to 18 reactors designated to use MOX. After Fukushima this was reduced to 12, only four of which are approved for operation, with three still awaiting approval to restart. Moreover, operation of the Monju FNR and Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s (JAEA’s) Joyo experimental FNR was impeded by a series of technical and political problems. This ultimately led to Monju’s closure but in May 2023, NRA said Joyo had met regulatory standards, and could restart.",
            "Japan is working closely with the USA on FNR development. JAEA, MHI, and Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR) recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US-based Terrapower to develop sodium-cooled fast reactor technology. This is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Design Demonstration Program (ARDP). MHI said Japan will accelerate innovations in various nuclear technologies through international collaboration on next-generation innovative reactors. Terrapower’s Natrium reactor is also being developed jointly with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy.",
            "In 2021, JAEA also resumed operation of its 30 MW experimental High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), closed for more than 10 years, after the HTGR was upgraded to meet the new regulatory requirements. JAEA is also co-operating with Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research to design a HTGR.",
            "Like China, South Korea is now largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western (mainly US) technology, which it is now exporting. Its 25 nuclear units at four sites have a total capacity of 24,489 MWe and account for around 27% of its electricity needs. Three more units under construction at two sites will add 4,020 MWe, with two units planned totalling 2,800 MWe.",
            "Most of South Korea’s nuclear units are LWRs apart from four Candu-6 PHWRs at its Wolsong NPP. South Korea’s first nuclear unit, Kori 1 (now closed), a Westinghouse unit built on a turnkey basis, began operation in 1978. Seven more were built in the 1980s based Westinghouse and Framatome technology including two involving Combustion Engineering (CE), which became part of Westinghouse. Korea’s ambitions to develop its own nuclear technology for export led to new reactor designs being developed. In 2005 the OPR- 1000 (Optimised Power Reactor) was launched with an eye to Asian markets. South Korea now has 10 operating OPR-1000 units and has since developed the Generation III APR-1400, three of which are in operation.",
            "Korea has an extensive nuclear R&D base and manufacturing capacity including state-owned Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Electric Power Co (Kepco) and subsidiary Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) as well as heavy engineering companies such as Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, and Doosan. These dominate the domestic market and are increasingly active globally.",
            "Projects include a variety of advanced reactors and SMRs, including the 330MWt System-Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART) reactor, which began development in 1997. In 2015 the SMART Power Company Ltd was launched supported by six supply chain companies to promote exports particularly to the Middle East and a co-operation agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia. Korea is also working on a sodium-cooled FNR in close co-operation with the US, and a HTGR for hydrogen generation.",
            "Korea is driven by considerations of energy security and the need to minimise dependence on imported fuels and technology. Kepco markets the OPR1000 and APR1400 globally. In 2009 the APR1400 was selected by the UAE for its four-unit Barakah NPP, now almost complete with three units already in operation ahead of schedule and within budget. Korea also won a contract in 2009 to supply a research reactor to Jordan, which was commissioned in 2016. In 2010 Korea announced plans to export 80 reactors by 2030, targeting 20% of the global market. It aimed to be 100% self-sufficient in nuclear technology by 2012, with no residual intellectual property constraints. US design certification for the APR1400 was finally approved in 2019 and in 2023 a new APR1000 design, specifically developed for the European market, was certified by the European Utility Requirements organisation. The success of the UAE project sparked interest worldwide and preliminary agreements were signed with several countries.",
            "Despite Fukushima, Korea announced plans in 2012 to increase nuclear’s share to 60% by 2035. However, in the face of growing public opposition, the government in 2013 drafted a reduced plan for a 29% nuclear share by 2035 and in 2017, the new government of President Moon Jae-in adopted a phase out plan. By the time this policy was reversed in 2023 by President Yoon Suk-yeol, the nuclear industry had lost a lot of ground. The new target was a 34.6% nuclear share by 2036, the export of 10 NPPs by 2030 and development of a Korean SMR design for export.",
            "Korea’s ties to the US have also complicated its nuclear development. The 1974 Korea-US Atomic Energy Agreement that limited raw material supply and banned uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing in Korea was extended for 20 years in 2015. Faced with pressure from Korea, the renewed agreement was framed more as a partnership, but it still contained restrictions. In May 2022 Korea joined the US-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme during a visit from US President Joe Biden’s visit to Korea to collaborate in promoting the global deployment of SMRs.",
            "However, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against KHNP after it signed an agreement with Polish private company ZE PAK to build an APR1400 at a former coal plant. This came after a tender to supply reactors for Poland’s nuclear power programme was awarded to Westinghouse. This also undermined Korea’s plans for possible exports to the Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit alleged intellectual property infringement by KHNP insisting on US government consent for export of the APR1400 claiming that it uses Westinghouse technology.",
            "India’s largely indigenous nuclear power programme is self- sufficient in reactor design and construction. Its 22 operable reactors at seven sites have a total capacity of 6,795 MWe, although three are currently suspended for repair leaving 19 operating units with a total capacity of 6,290 MWe. Eight more units under construction at four sites will add 6,028 MWe, with 12 further units planned. Nuclear currently accounts for around 1.5% of India’s installed power capacity. In April 2023 the government announced plans to increase nuclear capacity to 22,480 MWe by 2031, with nuclear accounting for nearly 9% of India’s electricity by 2047.",
            "The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are Indian designed PHWRs. Other technologies include India’s first power reactor, a Canadian supplied Candu at Rajasthan NPP, which started up in 1973 and closed in 2004; two BWRs built by GE on a turnkey contract at Tarapur NPP (currently suspended); and two VVERs (PWRs) at Kudankulam supplied by Russia. India is also building a 500 MWe FNR at Kalpakkam. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is responsible for construction and operation of India’s NPPs and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (Bhavini) is responsible for FNR development.",
            "Engineering companies, such as state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL), are key players in nuclear construction. The 1962 Atomic Energy Act prohibited private control of nuclear power generation. Amendments in 2016 only allow public sector joint ventures and direct foreign investment only in the supply chain and not in construction.",
            "India has a large and sophisticated nuclear R&D and manufacturing base, having launched its first research reactor, supplied by the UK, in 1957. Initially nuclear development was supported mainly by the UK, Canada, the US and France. However, after India’s nuclear bomb test in 1974, all support was withdrawn. The newly established Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), from which India was excluded, prevented India from importing any nuclear technology or fuel, setting it on a path of independent nuclear development.",
            "With limited uranium resources, India embarked on a three-stage programme aimed at using its abundant thorium resources based on an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle. Stage 1 would use PHWRs and LWRs. Plutonium from these would fuel the fast reactors planned for Stage 2. Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) in Stage 3 would burn thorium-plutonium fuels in a self- sustaining fuel cycle. An alternative end stage could be molten salt breeder reactors (MSBRs).",
            "India immediately embarked on construction of small PHWRs and by 2008, 12 200-220 MWe units were in operation at five sites, as well as two 540 MWe units at Tarapur NPP.",
            "In 2002 the regulatory authority approved construction of a 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, which is now nearing completion, while research is underway on molten salt reactors (MSRs).",
            "Only Russia continued cooperation based on a 1988 agreement that pre-dated the NSG, and in 2002 began construction of two VVER-1000 units at the Kudankulam NPP. Then, in 2005, India signed a civil nuclear agreement with the US, leading in 2008 to an NSG waiver for India, despite its not signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). This enabled nuclear trade to resume but negotiations to include India as a full NSG member have so far stalled on Chinese opposition. Nevertheless, the waiver enabled India to sign nuclear cooperation agreements with numerous countries and to start discussions with the US, France, Japan and South Korea on possible construction.",
            "However, India’s nuclear liability regime impeded progress. Following the 1984 Bhopal disaster India passed a law, making equipment suppliers responsible for any future accident. Amendments in 2010 made plant operators primarily liable but still allowed possible recourse to suppliers. A compromise was reached with Russia, which continued construction at Kudankulam, where two units are now operating with two more under construction and others planned. Other suppliers remained hesitant. While projects were agreed with France for six EPRs at Jaitapur and with the US for six AP1000s at Kovvada, they have not been finalised. India, meanwhile, embarked on a programme to build larger 700 MWe PHWRs, the first of which began operating at the Kakrapar NPP (unit 3) in 2021, with plans for 10 more.",
            "Pakistan has six operable reactors at two sites supplied on a turnkey basis by China, with a total capacity of 3,262 MWe. Four CNP-300 reactors (300-315 MWe) at the Chasma NPP site began operation between 2011 and 2017. In June 2023, Pakistan and China signed an agreement for construction of a 1,100 MWe Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor for Chasma 5. Unit 1 at the Karachi NPP site, a 137 MWe Candu supplied by Canada that began operation in 1971 and closed in 2021 was the first nuclear power unit in Asia. The site also hosts two Chinese supplied 1,017 MWe Hualong One units that began operation in 2021 and 2022. Over the coming decade Pakistan plans to expand its nuclear power generating capacity to 8,800 MWe.",
            "Pakistan has a significant R&D base but much of it is linked to the military programme. The Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology (Pinstech) at Rawalpindi with a US-supplied research reactor focuses on civil research and is under IAEA safeguards. Other facilities in Rawalpindi and Khushab continue to support weapons development.",
            "Like India, Pakistan is excluded from the NSG. However, all its power units are under IAEA safeguards and IAEA oversight and support is ongoing. In 2018 four IAEA national technical cooperation projects were amalgamated into a single project, PAK2007, “Strengthening and Enhancing Capabilities of Pakistan’s National Institutions to Support a Safe, Reliable & Sustainable Nuclear Power Programme”. This aims to streamline workflows, reduce delays and costs, enhance cooperation and harmonise safety and waste management approaches.",
            "Two of Taiwan’s three US-supplied two-unit NPPs (Chinshan, Kuosheng and Maanshan) have now been closed in line with a nuclear phase-out law adopted in 2016. A fourth NPP under construction, Lungmen, was cancelled. Taiwan’s six operable power reactors are to be decommissioned as their 40-year operating licences expire. Chinshan 1, Taiwan’s oldest plant, closed in 2018, followed by Chinshan 2 in 2019. These 600 MWe General Electric (GE) Mark I BWRs began operation in 1978 and 1979. Kuosheng 1&2, 985 MWe GE Mark III BWRs, which began operation in 1981 and 1983, were closed in 2021 and 2023. Construction of Lungmen 1&2 (both GE 1350 MWe ABWR units) began in 1999. Lungmen 1 was completed but mothballed in 2015, and construction of Lungmen 2 was suspended in 2014.",
            "Taiwan now has two operable nuclear units at the Maanshan plant, both Westinghouse 936 MWe PWRs, whose operating licences expire in 2024 and 2025. Owner-operator Taipower also operates coal power plants, which are to be replaced by natural gas turbines. Taiwan’s first deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are expected in 2023. While there is strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Taiwan, the opposition Kuomintang Party, which is expected to win the forthcoming elections, opposed the nuclear phase out.",
            "While early nuclear development in Asia was largely influenced by regional rivalries, today it is the focus of a global power struggle between China and the US. India has so far largely avoided involvement in this geopolitical game. Pakistan’s close ties with China are evident, as are South Korea’s and Japan’s ties with the US. China would clearly like to increase exports of its Hualong One and also SMRs, including floating NPPs, and is increasingly becoming a competitive vendor. There are numerous other runners and riders looking to embrace nuclear power, especially with the emergence of smaller modular reactors that are more appropriate in places where a full-sized NPP might be more challenging to justify. Longer term, it seems likely that Asia will continue to expand both its nuclear capacity and capabilities.",

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) is working to recycle used fuel from the closed EBR-II reactor to make high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) which is required by most advanced reactors designs. HALEU, enriched between 5% and 19.75% with uranium-235, is not currently available from domestic suppliers",
            "DOE plans to recover approximately 10 tonnes of HALEU from EBR-II fuel by December 2028 using an electrochemical process that was perfected over the years at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). EBR-II operated from 1964 to 1994 using a metallic alloy fuel containing highly enriched uranium (HEU).",
            "In order to recover that HEU, the used nuclear fuel is prepared and placed into a high-temperature molten salt chemical bath. An electric current is then used to separate the HEU metal from the fission products. The recovered uranium is cleaned and mixed with lower enriched uranium to create HALEU.",
            "The HALEU is then fabricated into a large circular ingot before being fashioned into low-dose, smaller shapes in a high-temperature furnace. The smaller ingots can then be used to produce fuel for advanced reactors. To date, almost five tonnes of HALEU material has been recovered from the used EBR-II fuel.",
            "US-based fission technology company Oklo has expressed interest in receiving five tonnes of HALEU pending a cooperative agreement with INL that was competitively awarded in 2019. The recovered material from EBR-II will be used in the initial core of its Aurora microreactor that is expected to be first demonstrated at the INL in 2026. DOE will retain ownership over the material before, during, and after its use.",
            "In addition to this project DOE is also supporting several efforts to provide more access to HALEU. Current activities include recycling used nuclear fuel from other government-owned research reactors; supporting the demonstration of HALEU production at the enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio, operated by Centrus Energy Corp; and acquiring HALEU through purchase agreements with domestic industry partners.",
            "The US Energy Act of 2020 authorised DOE to support availability of HALEU for domestic commercial use. In December 2022, DOE announced the creation of a HALEU Consortium to support the establishment of domestic HALEU infrastructure and to: calculate HALEU demand estimates for domestic commercial use; purchase HALEU made available to members for commercial use; carry out demonstration projects using HALEU; and identify actionable opportunities to improve the reliability of the HALEU supply chain.",
            "The Piketon plant is currently the only US facility licensed to enrich uranium up to HALEU levels. In February, Centrus completed the operational readiness review for its HALEU production facility and in June received permission from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to begin operation. DOE says Centrus subsidiary American Centrifuge Operating (ACO is on track to produce 20 kilograms of HALEU before the end of the year. ACO will then produce 900 kilograms the following year, with additional options to produce more HALEU in future years pending congressional appropriations.",
            "Recently Oklo signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Centrus to support deployment of Oklo’s Aurora microreactors and advanced nuclear fuel production in Southern Ohio. Oklo and Centrus became partners in 2021 after signing a Letter of Intent to cooperate in the development of a HALEU fuel facility.",
            "Centrus has also signed a MOU with US-based TerraPower to expand collaboration aimed at establishing commercial-scale, US production capabilities for HALEU to supply TerraPower’s first-of-a-kind Natrium reactor and energy storage system. In October 2022, Global Nuclear Fuel-Americas (GNF-A), a GE-led joint venture, and TerraPower agreed to build a Natrium Fuel Facility at the site of GNF-A’s existing plant site near Wilmington. The facility, which will use HALEU, will be jointly funded by TerraPower and DOE through the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. TerraPower and Centrus have been working together since 2021 when they entered into a contract for services to help expedite the commercialisation of domestic enrichment technology at Piketon.",

The power plants will be installed on barges to deliver from 200 MWe to 800 MWe, with the first project expected to be a 200MWe power barge. Previously, in January, South Korea’s Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) received Approval In Principle from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) for a conceptual design of a CMSR power barge using technology being developed by Seaborg.",
            "Seaborg's CMSR uses a low enriched fluoride fuel salt which is not yet commercially available. KNF offers nuclear fuel production and fluorides handling expertise, while GS E&C has broad experience in a variety of engineering and construction projects. Seaborg is engaged with a number of research partners covering different aspects of the fuel salt and its properties, and the partners believe they have a solid foundation to investigate the path to commercialisation of fuel salt production.",
            "KNF President & CEO Choi Ik-Soo said KNF “wants to explore adding molten salt fuel for 4th generation reactors to our portfolio, enabling us to stay in the forefront of nuclear fuel development in order to serve our clients\". Kim Young-Shin GS E&C Chief Technical Officer said development of molten salt reactors “looks promising”, and nuclear fuel for 4th generation reactors “is a very interesting business opportunity for GS E&C, which fits very well with our long-term strategic goals\". Seaborg CEO Navid Samandari said the collaboration “brings us one step closer to securing LEU fuel salt for our CMSR” and “further strengthens Seaborg's engagement with Korean industrial partners”.",
            "According to Seaborg, in the CMSR the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant with significant safety benefits. Should the fuel salt come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and become “solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself”. The reactor “will operate at near-atmospheric pressures eliminating a wide range of accident scenarios”.",
            "At the end of its 12-year fuel cycle, the fuel is returned to the supplier where short-lived fission products are separated and sent to storage. “Since the fuel is chemically stable and the fission products are short-lived, this waste is radiologically similar to radioactive hospital waste and can be handled using conventional methods,” says Seaborg. The remaining fuel salt will be mixed into new CMSR fuel at the fuel supplying facility.",
            "There are a number of molten salt reactor projects under development worldwide. In the USA, companies such as Terrapower are receiving financial and other support from the US Department of Energy. In Canada, Terrestrial Energy is developing its Integral Molten Salt Reactor, and UK-based MoltexFLEX has launched its FLEX reactor design based on molten salt technology. US company Thorcon’s molten salt reactor has been under development for around nine years, with the aim of deploying it in Indonesia. However, as with Seaborg, all these projects remain in the design stage. Russia has also launched a programme to develop a molten salt reactor bringing together all its key institutes and nuclear enterprises to work on the project. It remains to be seen which of these projects is first to produce a demonstration plant.",

        "text": [
            "UK-based start-up Core Power has attracted Japanese investment for its floating NPP (FNPP) project. Some 13 companies, including Onomichi Dockyard and Imabari Shipbuilding, have invested about $80m in project, according to Nikkei Asia. Although Core released no statement on the development, it reproduced the Nikkei article on its website.",
            "The paper noted that FNPPs “can theoretically be placed anywhere at sea and, because they float, they would not be affected by earthquakes” and “can also withstand tsunamis if placed offshore” Moreover, the electricity produced can be sent ashore and used to produce hydrogen and ammonia. FNPPs “are thought to be particularly marketable in Japan as an island nation,” Nikkei commented.",
            "“With demand expected to grow worldwide, Japanese companies hope to become more involved in the technological development in areas where foreign businesses have an edge, such as modular nuclear reactors.”",
            "Core Power, set up in 2018, is focusing on developing offshore nuclear power. The Japanese companies taking part in the project have subscribed to a third-party allocation of new shares by Core Power, which has raised about $100m and is now majority-owned by Japanese companies.",
            "Core Power is developing a FNPP in collaboration with US-based TerraPower and power utility Southern, as well as France’s Orano.",
            "The reactors developed by the four companies will be molten chloride fast reactors. According to Nikkei, the system uses a liquid fuel with a high boiling point that can operate at normal pressure to generate electricity. This eliminates the need for the pressurisation equipment used in conventional solid-fuel NPPs and allows the plant to be miniaturised. It also reduces the risk of accidents, such as meltdowns and explosions. The reactors have a planned output of 300 MWe each, “and three to four units would be equivalent to a conventional nuclear power plant”.",
            "The construction cost is estimated at about half that of land-based systems, and the construction time can be reduced by 70%. “Core Power is interested in Japanese shipbuilding technology and hopes to work with Japanese companies to develop floating equipment for the project,” Nikkei said.",
            "The company plans to launch a demonstration vessel in 2026 and commercialise it between 2030 and 2032. Core Power aims to build a track record overseas, then expand in Japan. It is estimated that the demonstration vessel will require approximately JPY50bn ($361m), and Core Power and the its three partner companies will share the cost. The investment by Japanese companies will also be used to fund development.",
            "\"We want to keep up with the world's latest technology trends,\" said an executive from Onomichi Dockyard, which decided to invest JPY1bn in Core Power. “Small modular reactors are expected to be easy to use in floating power plants and Japanese companies hope to gain expertise by participating in the project,” Nikkei noted.",
            "In August 2022, Core Power, MIT Energy Initiative and INL were awarded research funding by DOE's Nuclear Energy University Program, a three-year study into the development of offshore floating nuclear power generation in the USA.",
            "Core Power is also a participant with US-based TerraPower and power utility Southern Co, in the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE). In 2021, Southern Company DOE signed an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE as a proof-of-concept critical fast-spectrum salt reactor. MCRE aims to be which the world's first fast-spectrum salt reactor to achieve criticality at INL, Collaborators in the MCRE project are Terrapower, INL, Orano (USA) Federal Services, Electric Power Research Institute, and 3M Company.",
            "The project is supported through the DOE's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) under a five-year, $170m cost-shared funding agreement. It will provide crucial operational data to support the future development of TerraPower's Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR), informing the design, licensing and operation of a demonstration reactor.",
            "Core Power’s plan to launch a demonstration vessel in 2026, appears to be over ambitious. Core Power receives no mention at all in the International Atomic Energy’s comprehensive publication on Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments published in 2022. Of the 13 molten salt reactors (MSRs) described in the publication only two have reached the detailed design stage. And most advanced of those, Terrestrial Energy’s integral molten salt reactor, which has already made some progress towards licensing, does not plan to begin construction until 2027. Two of the 13 envisage floating NPPs – Seaborg’s compact MSR (Denmark), which is still in the conceptual design stage, and US-based Thorcon’s MSR which is in the preliminary design stage. However, both of these have unrealistic completion dates of 2027/28, given that neither has made any real progress towards licensing.",

            "Holtec's 160 MWe small modular reactor (SMR) is a pressurised light-water reactor using low-enriched uranium fuel. The reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, according to the design. Other features include a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat.",
            "The design, which has been in development since 2010, has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's three-phase pre-licensing vendor design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "Holtec’s collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C and K-Sure was announced during the Korea-US Advanced Industry & Clean Energy Partnership Event hosted by Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy in Washington DC in April. Holtec said the agreement calls for \"an expansion of nuclear power plant deployments to underpin the global growth of clean energy and decarbonisation of the environment\". Hyundai E&C said it expected the agreement to accelerate the global advancement of the Korean NPP business “by establishing a multilateral support system of public financial institutions for technical cooperation between Hyundai E&C and Holtec”.",
            "Holtec and Hyundai E&C also signed a financial support agreement with Kexim to \"facilitate the adoption of SMR-160 reactors around the globe promoting the urgently needed decarbonisation of the environment\".",
            "In November 2021, Holtec and Hyundai E&C signed a teaming agreement whereby Hyundai E&C will perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction using its Building Information Modelling management process. The partnership also provides for conditional project delivery rights for Hyundai. In October 2022, it was agreed to accelerate the programme to complete the balance of plant design of the remaining systems and structures.",
            "During the Washington event, Kexin President & Chairman Hee-sung Yoon recalled the key role played by Hyundai founder u-yung Chung, in shaping the inception and rise of the Kexim bank and pledged his support to the Hyundai/Holtec team for the deployment of SMR-160 reactors. Holtec CEO Dr Kris Singh welcomed the strong business ties forged by Holtec and Hyundai while Hyundai E&C CEO Young-joon Yoon expressed his unwavering commitment to ensure the success of the Hyundai/Holtec partnership.",

Kepco and GE Vernova agreed to fortify partnerships to facilitate the utilisation of ammonia as an energy source. ExxonMobil signed an agreement with state-run Korea National Oil Corp and SK Materials to facilitate clean ammonia and low-carbon businesses. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering and SK E&S are to co-operate with US Plug Power GE Vernova on blue hydrogen projects. Doosan and Doosan Robotics are to strengthen ties with Rockwell Automation on technology development and marketing for smart factory operation",

The MOU also included technical support to better promote and supply NuScale Power's VOYGR SMRs to the global market. NuScale will be able to use Korea's global supply chains to build its SMRs.",
            "This is a further step in a relationship between Doosan Enerbility and NuScale dating back to 2019 when they jointly agreed on investment of $104m. At the end of 2022, NuScale placed the first upper reactor pressure vessel long lead material production order with Doosan. Then in March 2023, the two signed an agreement to manufacture SMRs to be supplied to the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), a power plant project scheduled to be completed by 2029. John Hopkins, President & CEO of NuScale Power, said: “The momentum towards creating a domestic and global supply chain to deploy our SMR technology is accelerating.”",

The company is building a 345 MWe demonstration SMR in Wyoming, with a target completion date of 2030, and the US Department of Energy (DOE) is supporting this project with approximately $2bn under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP). PacifiCorp, an electric utility company and subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, has partnered with TerraPower to study the construction of up to five additional Natrium plants within their service territory by 2033. In their recently released Integrated Resource Plan, PacifiCorp has identified the need for two additional Natrium plants in Utah to replace retiring coal generating stations.",

        "text": [
            "US PacifiCorp, owner of the ageing Wyoming coal plant selected in 2021 as the future site for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor demonstration project, has released its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP). This considers the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer in Wyoming is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology, developed in collaboration with GE Hitachi. The plant will feature a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt–based energy storage system. This could boost the reactor’s output to 500 MWe when necessary to integrate with variable renewable energy sources.",
            "However, in December, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of its Kemmerer reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies.",
            "“The advanced nuclear resources that appear in the plan [IRP] represent a promising future for our employees and communities in rural Utah and Wyoming,” stated Rick Link, senior vice president of resource planning, procurement & optimisation at PacifiCorp. “As we transition to a net-zero energy future, it is important to leverage the experience, skills, and dedication of the communities that have supplied our energy needs for the past century.” Chris Levesque, TerraPower’s president & CEO said he was pleased with the additional Natrium units in the IRP and looked forward to continuing to work with PacifiCorp.",
            "However, overall advanced reactors play only a minor role in the 365-page IRP. The biennial long-term resource plan calls for a dramatic increase of nearly four times the company’s current wind and solar resources to a total of 20,000 MW by 2032, in addition to 7,400 MW of energy storage by 2029. While the plan continues investments in innovative emissions-free technologies, including advanced nuclear and non-emitting peaking resources, their realisation will depend on wider developments.",
            "“Our Integrated Resource Plan is designed to determine the lowest-cost options for customers, adjusting for risks, future customer needs, system reliability, market projections and changing technology,” said Link. “We depended a great deal on public involvement by utility regulators, customers and other stakeholder groups to develop this plan.”",
            "The IRP says it was “developed through comprehensive data analysis and computer modelling of the future needs of customers, together with an assessment of available resource types” and “yields a preferred portfolio of resources across a 20-year planning horizon”. It “selects the least-cost, least-risk resource types, which will become the basis for a future Request for Proposals, a competitive bidding process that will select specific projects for construction”.",
            "It would appear that Pacificorp’s inclusion of the Natrium technology is, to a large extent, dependent on government support. “We’re working with TerraPower, as part of a public-private partnership with the US Department of Energy [DOE], to support the development of advanced nuclear reactors with integrated salt storage projects near retiring coal plants.” It continues: “In the 2023 IRP, the NatriumTM demonstration project is envisioned for placement at the Naughton facility in Kemmerer, Wyoming. With recent federal legislation and studies on the opportunities of a coal-to-nuclear energy transition, TerraPower and PacifiCorp remain committed to bringing the Natrium technology to market for the benefit of grid reliability and stability and for energy-producing communities in Wyoming and Utah.”",
            "It further notes that in October 2020 that DOE through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP), had awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate the Natrium technology. To date, Congress has appropriated $160m for the ARDP and DOE has committed additional funding in the coming years, subject to appropriations. In June 2021, PacifiCorp announced efforts with TerraPower and DOE “to advance the NatriumTM demonstration project to be sited at a retiring coal plant near, Kemmerer, Wyoming”.",
            "On October 2022, TerraPower and PacifiCorp announced a joint study to evaluate the feasibility of deploying up to five additional NatriumTM reactor and integrated energy storage systems in the PacifiCorp service territory by 2035. “The joint study will evaluate, among other things, the potential for advanced reactors to be located near current fossil-fuelled generation sites, enabling PacifiCorp to repurpose existing generation and transmission assets for the benefit of its customers.”",
            "The IRP specifies: “With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and recent studies on the opportunities of a coal-to-nuclear energy transition, TerraPower and PacifiCorp remain committed to bringing the NatriumTM technology to market and providing reliability and stability to the grid as well as to energy producing communities.”",
            "At the end of the report, the IRP looks at a number of different scenarios. The only one with a positive assessment of advanced nuclear is “High CO2 prices with accelerated coal retirements”. In this case, the Near-Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2023-2032) will “accelerate timing of new resource additions including an advanced nuclear resource from 2033 to 2032”. The Long Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2033-2042) envisages that, “by 2042, new nuclear peaking capacity is increased by 500 MW”.",
            "However, the “No NatriumTM Advanced Nuclear Demonstration Project in 2030, and no other nuclear projects” scenario offers a different perspective. The Near-Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2023-2032) notes: “Without the NatriumTM demonstration project, 289 MW of non-emitting peaking resource is added in 2030. In 2032 the second advanced nuclear plant is replaced by 303 MW of non-emitting peaking resource and 200 MW of four-hour battery storage.",
            "The Long Term Resource Acquisition Strategy (2033-2042) notes: “Without the NatriumTM demonstration project, 289 MW of non-emitting peaking resource is added in 2030.

In 2033, 303 MW of non-emitting peaking resources and 200 MW of four-hour battery storage replace 500 MW of nuclear capacity.",
            "The IRP says scenario risk assessment “pertains to abrupt or fundamental changes to variables that are appropriately handled by scenario analysis as opposed to representation by a statistical process or expected-value forecast”. It adds: “The single most important scenario risks of this type facing PacifiCorp continues to be government actions related to emissions and changes in load and transmission infrastructure…. The company’s use of IRP sensitivity analysis covering different resource policy and cost assumptions also addresses the need for consideration of scenario risks for long-term resource planning. The extent to which future regulatory policy shifts do not align with PacifiCorp’s resource investments determined to be prudent by state commissions is a risk borne by customers.",
            "Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more then 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.” While Natrium is anticipated to come online in the summer of 2030, the 2023 IRP “includes two ‘no nuclear’ variant studies … designed to inform alternative path analysis and potential costs and benefits. PacifiCorp continues to evaluate nuclear resources within the context of an evolving planning environment”."

        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. “While the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,” according to NEA. “Recent NEA analysis … finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.”",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

NEA also classifies them according to reactor configurations including 17 land-based designs; five multi-module designs; three marine-based designs; and one mobile design.",
            "NEA notes that SMRs can replace fossil fuels for on-grid power generation, diesel generators for off-grid mining and industrial operations, and fossil fuels for cogeneration of heat and power for heavy industries and district heating. They can also enable large-scale water treatment and desalination to produce clean potable water. “These varied market needs have prompted the development of a range of SMR technologies, which vary in technology, sizes, and configuration.” NEA comments: “Policymakers are often overwhelmed with this great variety as they strive to consider which designs might meet their particular needs and in what time frame.”",
            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci. Meanwhile, Russia’s KLT40S and China’s HTR-PM are already in operation.",
            "Much greater detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. This provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. The 424 pages provide details of the technologies involved while Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines. The first booklet in this series was first published in 2014 and serves as a supplement to the IAEA’s Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), an online database with comprehensive information on the latest developments in advanced reactors.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction to the latest edition: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",
            "All the other designs, including those mentioned by NEA, are either in the pre-conceptual/conceptual or basic/detailed design stages. Those still in the conceptual design stage include U Battery, eVinci, Nuward and Sealer-55.",
            "IAEA notes that the technical description and major technical parameters in the booklet “were provided by the design organisations without validation or verification by the IAEA. All figures, illustrations and tables in technical description of each design were also provided by the design organisations.” A similar caveat is given by NEA."

        "text": [
            "US-based Nano Nuclear Energy has been selected as a founding member of the US Department of Energy’s HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium) Consortium. This came after Nano Nuclear earlier in February established a new subsidiary – HALEU Energy Fuel. The HALEU Consortium was established in 2022 to support the availability of HALEU for civilian domestic research, development, demonstration, and commercial use. Nano says HALEU Energy Fuel “will play a crucial role in the collaboration with the DOE on the future of North America’s HALEU fuel pipeline, reinforcing the United States energy sovereignty”.",
            "The HALEU Consortium recently met with DOE officials in its first meeting. Centrus Energy Corp, Dow Chemical, TerraPower, and the Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) were among those also announced as founding members.",
            "“I have always been supportive to establish a strong supply of HALEU during my tenure at numerous national laboratories,” said, Nano’s Head of Nuclear Laboratory & Technologies Dr Jeffrey L Binder. “I’m glad to see steps being taken to ensure a domestic source of HALEU will be a cornerstone of the next evolution of the nuclear energy industry and provide a reliable fuel source for the future of advanced nuclear reactors.”",
            "The consortium will provide a forum through which DOE will work with individual members to support the availability of HALEU for civilian domestic demonstration and commercial use. It will also develop arrangements to provide HALEU to individual members for demonstration projects and commercial uses.",
            "Russia is currently the only commercial source of HALEU and accounted for nearly 40% of global uranium conversion services in 2020. The US is now looking to develop its own HALEU production facilities in face of concerns about energy independence. The US Congress directed DOE to establish a HALEU availability programme in the Energy Act of 2020 and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently approved Centrus Energy’s request to make HALEU fuel at its enrichment facility in Piketon, Ohio. Moreover, in the recently signed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) some $700m was allocated to develop a domestic supply chain for HALEU."

            "US Centrus Energy Corp has completed construction of a demonstration cascade of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges and major supporting systems in Piketon, Ohio. This is a step towards US first-of-a-kind production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) planned for the end of 2023, assuming it completes the remaining support systems and obtains final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This will be the first new US technology enrichment plant to begin production in 70 years.",
            "HALEU is an advanced nuclear fuel required for most of the next-generation reactor designs currently under development. HALEU is uranium that has been enriched to between 5% and 20% uranium 235 (U-235). This is higher than the 3-5% U-235 low-enriched uranium fuels used in the existing fleet of light water reactors.",
            "Nine of the 10 advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) will need HALEU. This includes two demonstration reactors -Terrapower’s Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor and X-energy’s Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactor. However, currently the only company able to supply HALEU fuel is Russia’s Techsnabexport (Tenex).",
            "“This is a major milestone for Centrus, for the advanced nuclear sector, and for the vital effort to restore America’s domestic uranium enrichment capability,” said Centrus Energy President & CEO Daniel B Poneman. “We are strongly committed to pioneering production of HALEU to support the deployment of US advanced reactor designs around the world. Our goal is to scale up this facility to meet the full range of commercial, government, and national security requirements for uranium enrichment, including low-enriched uranium for existing reactors and HALEU for advanced reactors.”",
            "In November 2022, DOE announced a new, competitively-awarded contract with Centrus to finish the cascade, complete final regulatory steps and begin operation. In December, Centrus Energy’s wholly-owned subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), signed a “definitised” contract with DOE to pioneer production of HALEU. As part of a previous, cost-shared contract awarded in 2019, Centrus had been deploying its AC100M advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in Piketon and had secured a licence amendment from the NRC, making it the only NRC-licensed HALEU production site.",
            "Before operations can begin, Centrus needs to finish construction of the remaining support systems, including a fissile materials storage area, so that the HALEU produced for DOE can be stored onsite. It must also complete final operational readiness reviews with the NRC to obtain approval to begin production. The operational readiness reviews are required under Centrus’s NRC licence, which was successfully amended in 2021 to allow for HALEU production.",
            "Centrus says it is also investigating the possibility of scaling up the Piketon facility with additional centrifuge cascades for expanded HALEU production. This depends on securing sufficient funding or offtake contracts. A full-scale HALEU cascade comprises 120 individual centrifuge machines, with a combined capacity of approximately 6,000 kilograms of HALEU a year (6 MTU/year). This could be brought online within about 42 months of securing the funding with the capability to add an additional cascade every six months. Such expansion would support thousands of direct and indirect jobs across a 100% domestic manufacturing supply chain, Centrus notes. It would be capable of meeting US national security requirements.",

            "SHI and Seaborg signed a partnership agreement to develop floating nuclear power plants",
            "based on Seaborg’s CMSR. The agreement included development of hydrogen production plants and ammonia plants, as the CMSR is an ideal power source for supply of stable, clean, and safe electricity.",
            "The Power Barge, designed by SHI, can be equipped with 2-8 100MW CMSRs as required. SHI says it is not only an alternative to existing fossil fuel power generation facilities, but also can produce electricity and heat for industrial systems, hydrogen production, and seawater desalination facilities.",
            "According to Seaborg, in the CMSR the fuel is mixed into a molten fluoride salt which also acts as the coolant with significant safety benefits. Should the fuel salt come into contact with the atmosphere, it will simply cool down and become “solid rock, containing all the radioactive material within itself”. The reactor “will operate at near-atmospheric pressures eliminating a wide range of accident scenarios”.",
            "At the end of its 12-year fuel cycle, the fuel is returned to the supplier where short-lived fission products are separated and sent to storage. “Since the fuel is chemically stable and the fission products are short-lived, this waste is radiologically similar to radioactive hospital waste and can be handled using conventional methods,” says Seaborg. The remaining fuel salt will be mixed into new CMSR fuel at the fuel supplying facility.",

An optional solution is to place a hydrogen or ammonia production plant next to the barge which will supply power to that plant. According to Seaborg’s timeline, the first barge will be delivered in 2028, with serial production to begin in 2030.",
            "There are a number of molten salt reactor projects under development worldwide. In the USA, companies such as Terrapower are receiving financial and other support from the US Department of Energy. In Canada, Terrestrial Energy is developing its Integral Molten Salt Reactor, and UK-based MoltexFLEX has launched its FLEX reactor design based on molten salt technology. US company Thorcon’s molten salt reactor has been under development for around nine years, with the aim of deploying it in Indonesia. However, as with Seaborg, all these projects remain in the design stage. Russia has also launched a programme to develop a molten salt reactor bringing together all its key institutes and nuclear enterprises to work on the project. It remains to be seen which of these projects is first to produce a demonstration plant.",

Anticipating the decision, TRISO-X, in October, broke ground and began construction of the facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (TF3) is expected to create more than 400 jobs and attract investment of approximately $300 million. TF3 is set to be commissioned and operational by 2025.",
            "In a letter to TRISO-X, NRC said that the agency had \"determined that the application provides sufficient information to proceed with a detailed technical review\" and further \"established a 30-month review schedule to be completed by June 2025.\"",
            "TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprises three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The coatings have uniform characteristics in all directions. Fuel particles, each the size of a poppy seed, are enriched to a level four times higher than fuel used in most of today’s commercial nuclear reactors. The coatings retain fission products, making each particle its own containment system. DOE says TRISO is “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth”.",
            "In 2020, the DOE selected X-energy for their Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to receive up to $1.2 billion of federal cost-shared funding to develop, license, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors by the end of the decade. The TRISO-X nuclear fuel produced in the Oak Ridge TF3 will be used in X-energy’s Xe-100 high-temperature gas reactors, which are expected to be operational by 2028. Since 2016, TRISO-X has operated a pilot-scale nuclear fuel fabrication facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to further develop its TRISO-X fuel and support the Xe-100 reactor design.",
            "“TRISO-X will be the nation’s first commercial scale facility dedicated to fuelling reactors that require high-assay low-enriched uranium TRISO particles,” said Dr Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy earlier this year. “It’s a job creator and an advanced reactor enabler that will help fuel a transition to a net-zero economy.”",
            "However, TRISO fuel development is also continuing at several of the US national laboratories. Earlier in December, BWX Technologies (BWXT) began production of TRISO nuclear fuel intended for the first US microreactor (Project Pele). Under a $37 million award from Idaho National Laboratory (INL), BWXT will manufacture a core for Project Pele, TRISO fuel for additional reactors and coated particle fuel for NASA. The fuel will be down-blended from US government stockpiles of HALEU and fabricated into TRISO fuel at BWXT’s facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. BWXT facilities are the only private US facilities licensed to possess and process highly enriched uranium.",

However, the US is facing problems as domestic production is limited and previous supplies from Russia are no longer available.",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million and DOE has also established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio. However, Centrus Energy Corp is expected to be producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023. Terrapower has postponed its Natrium plans by two years because of the HALEU shortage.

            "US Terrapower’s advanced Natrium nuclear reactor proposed for southwestern Wyoming is expected to be delayed by at least two years, Jeff Navin, TerraPower’s director of external affairs has told the Caspar Star-Tribune. Following Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, the supply of high assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) needed to fuel the reactor is now in doubt. “We had a plan. It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first coreload of fuel come from Russia,” Navin said.",

            "In June 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and PacifiCorp announced efforts to advance their Natrium reactor demonstration project at a retiring coal plant in Wyoming, ultimately deciding on Naughton Power Plant outside Kemmerer as the site.",
            "The Natrium system is a TerraPower and GE Hitachi technology. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners. The project features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe of power for more than five and a half hours when needed.",
            "Building a fleet of advanced nuclear reactors hinges on securing a dependable fuel source. But the private sector is reluctant to risk too much money on an industry still in its infancy. Russia, the only commercial source of HALEU fuel, was supposed to bridge that gap, but this is now in question, Navin noted.",
            "Terrapower initially turned to the US Department of Energy (DOE). In the hope that the government would be able to source sufficient weapons-grade uranium (most of which will come from nuclear warheads) enriched to around 95% and downblend it to the lower concentration needed. Officials tried, Navin said, and are still looking. “They just don’t have the capacity to disassemble a large volume of warheads any faster than they’re already disassembling them.”",
            "TerraPower is also looking to Congress, which allocated half the funding for the roughly $4 billion Wyoming project and has increased efforts to accelerate commercial fuel production. These efforts are being supported by Senator John Barrasso, (Wyoming). Barrasso said in a statement on 13 December that “TerraPower’s announcement underscores what I’ve been saying for years: America must re-establish itself as the global leader in nuclear energy. Instead of relying on our adversaries like Russia for uranium, the United States must produce its own supply of nuclear fuel.”",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million toward that effort. In December 2022, DOE established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio.",
            "The federal support will go a long way to attract private investmenta and establish a reliable, commercial supply of HALEU in the US, perhaps in time to meet the 2028 in-service deadline in Kemmerer, Navin said. But the Natrium reactor will require an initial “core load” fuel delivery in 2025, which is why TerraPower is asking federal officials to downblend enough weapons-grade uranium to meet that timeline. Combined, TerraPower’s Natrium and X-energy’s Xe-100 demonstration projects could require about 20 metric tons of HALEU derived from downblending, Navin estimated. Centrus Energy Corp   will begin producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023.",
            "However, Navin said the fuel problems are “not going to change our schedule, in terms of when we’re going to start construction – it gives us a little more flexibility on that point”. In 2023, TerraPower still aims to break ground on a test facility at the project site, where both remaining coal units at electric utility PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant are slated to retire in 2025, and apply for a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "“We all recognised when we started this process, it was never going to be easy,” he said. “We didn’t anticipate this particular curveball, but this is, certainly, of all of the challenges that we’re facing, the one that is going to cause the biggest delay.” TerraPower remains confident, however, that the U.S. supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035. Its joint study with PacifiCorp of the available options, announced in October, is on track to be finished late next year.",
            "“We obviously have to focus on getting the first one built,” Navin said. “There’s always hiccups in a first-of-a-kind project. But we really are committed to working with our customer in PacifiCorp and trying to find a way to even expand the footprint that we have in Wyoming.”",
            "One other question, however, remains. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. The US Department of Energy (DOE) in July issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades. Even if the fuel problem is somehow resolved, this could be another obstacle.",

These projects round out the 11 which are receiving funding under this round of ARPA-E funding.",
            "All these research projects seek to increase the deployment and use of nuclear power as a reliable source of clean energy by limiting the volume of waste produced from Advanced Reactors. By mitigating waste and storage concerns, the goal is to support clean energy infrastructure and pave the way for a new era of nuclear energy. Indeed, the DOE recently released a supply chain report noting that the development of fuel and an integrated waste disposal strategy for advanced reactor technologies are significant factors in supporting further nuclear energy deployment. As Secretary of Energy Jennifer M Granholm says: “Developing novel approaches to safely manage nuclear waste will enable us to power even more homes and businesses in America with carbon-free nuclear energy. ARPA-E is doing just that by supporting companies",
            "and universities that are working on next-generation technologies to modernise advanced reactors and strengthen the nation’s clean energy enterprise”."

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has said that the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative had awarded vouchers to Orano Federal Services and TerraPower to help advance their nuclear technologies. Both voucher recipients will gain access to the DOE’s national lab complex.",
            "Orano is partnering with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop a new technical study that updates the physical chemistry limits of uranium hexafluoride gas enriched up to 10% that can be safely transported in existing shipping containers. The new study will be used for review and approval by radioactive material transport regulators.",
            "TerraPower will leverage the neutron testing capabilities at Los Alamos National Laboratory to measure the properties of chlorine isotopes to determine how they will behave in the company’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor Experiment. The data generated will help reduce regulatory uncertainty of chloride salt reactors.",
            "GAIN voucher recipients do not receive direct financial awards but are provided access to the national labs at no cost. All awardees are responsible for a minimum 20% cost share, which could be an in-kind contribution.",
            "GAIN, established by NE, provides the nuclear community with the technical, regulatory, and financial support necessary to move innovative nuclear technologies toward commercialisation while ensuring the continued, safe, and economic operation of the existing fleet. The vouchers are the third round awarded for FY 2022."

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has listed five key takeaways from DOE’s latest budget request that advance nuclear energy and help support the nation’s ambitious goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",
            "(DOE released its Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) Budget request in April. The request includes $1.7 billion for NE and is one of the highest ever requests for NE. “This will allow the office to act swiftly on funding activities to support emerging technologies and improvements to the nuclear fuel cycle,” NE said.",
            "The Budget complements the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which provides more than $62 billion for DOE over five years to deliver a more equitable clean energy future. The BIL includes funding to demonstrate advanced reactors, preserve the existing fleet, and develop new ways to produce clean hydrogen, including the use of nuclear energy. NE said it “will continue supporting the implementation of the BIL in coordination with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Grid Deployment Office”.",
            "Advanced reactor demos are moving to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The BIL includes approximately $2.5 billion through FY26 to support the demonstrations of X-energy’s Xe-100 reactor and TerraPower’s Natrium reactor in the USA. Project management and oversight functions for both projects will be carried out under DOE’s new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations as outlined in the BIL. NE will continue to manage other projects under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",
            "The R&D request is increased by 8%. NE is requesting roughly $725 million in research and development activities — an 8% increase over the FY22 request. The request includes $140 million to support projects awarded under ARDP and $12 million to help mature three additional design concepts. The request also supports continued development of small modular and microreactor projects, including MARVEL, which will be used to demonstrate end-use applications in the mid-2020s.",
            "HALEU should be made available for advanced reactor fuel. NE is requesting $95 million to further establish a programme to incentivise the commercial production of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The funding will be used to procure enriched uranium and deconversion services under the recently formed HALEU Availability programme. The request also supports DOE’s HALEU enrichment demonstration project that is expected to produce 900 kilograms of HALEU a year to help support the demonstration of advanced reactors.",
            "US university R&D should be advanced. NE is consolidating some of its funding into a new bucket this year to better serve small businesses and US universities, with specific attention to the needs of minority serving institutions (MSIs) and disadvantaged communities. The office is requesting $161 million to support emerging technologies developed by US universities, colleges, and small businesses. The funding also supports university infrastructure improvements and fuel services along with workforce development, including scholarships and fellowships. This newly proposed line item in the budget will allow faculty to propose bolder and more creative R&D directions and empower NE to support the expansion of nuclear engineering programmes at MSIs. NE plans to issue a request for information by the end of fiscal year 2022 to help identify research infrastructure and other capabilities as a focus for those new and expanding university programmes.",
            "Consent-based siting is important. NE’s budget request includes $53 million to further develop DOE’s integrated waste management strategy for used nuclear fuel. The request includes money to continue early-phase funding for interested groups, communities, States, and Tribes to explore consent-based siting and interim storage, support mutual learning, and reduce barriers to participation in the consent-based siting process."
