            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",
            "“The reason behind this race toward nuclear is simple,” she said. “The world needs more power, and we need it sooner than projected.”",

            "Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) said it has entered an agreement with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) to support its planning and preliminary licensing for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 small modular reactor (SMR) at the Clinch River site near Oak Ridge in Tennessee.",
            "An artist rendering of a potential SMR facility at Clinch River (Image: TVA)",
            "Under the agreement, GEH will also provide additional information needed as TVA continues to analyse the viability of SMRs in the Tennessee Valley, subject to future approval by its board of directors.",
            "\"TVA recently issued an industry-leading request for proposal for 5000 megawatts of carbon-free energy to be available by 2029 and, knowing the critical role advanced nuclear technology will play in our nation's drive to decarbonisation, we signed a partnership with GE Hitachi to advance our pursuit of small modular reactor technology,\" said TVA President and CEO Jeff Lyash.",
            "TVA said the agreement with GEH follows a collaboration agreement with Ontario Power Generation (OPG) in April this year to develop advanced nuclear technology, including SMRs, in both Canada and the USA. The agreement allows the companies to coordinate their explorations into the design, licensing, construction and operation of SMRs.",
            "OPG last year selected GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300 SMR for deployment at Darlington, where it says Canada's first commercial, grid-scale, SMR could be completed as soon as 2028. TVA has not yet specified a technology for construction at Clinch River, but the company has been in discussions with GE Hitachi concerning the BWRX-300, with Lyash in February saying he believed light-water reactor designs which are closely related to TVA's existing large units are closer to commercial deployment within the next decade. TVA has also partnered with Kairos Power in its project to deploy the Hermes low-power demonstration reactor at the East Tennessee Technology Park in Oak Ridge.",
            "Referring to the company's agreements with GEH and OPG, Lyash said: \"Such collaborations could help reduce the financial risk that comes from development of innovative technology, as well as future deployment costs.\"",
            "In February, TVA announced a new programme to explore advanced nuclear technology as part of its decarbonisation goals, with the pursuit of a construction licence application for an SMR at the Clinch River site one of its first tasks. It already has an early site permit (ESP) - issued by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 2019 - which certifies that a site is suitable for the construction of a nuclear power plant from the point of view of site safety, environmental impact and emergency planning, but does not specify the choice of technology.",

        "title": "NEA launches second edition of its Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",
            "Much greater technological detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. The 424 pages provide data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. However, this depends largely on information from the designers. Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines."

Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303m on a performance-based, fixed-price milestone basis to enable the design, construction, and commissioning of the company’s Hermes demonstration reactor. A construction permit for the reactor was issued by the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in December 2023.",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s. Hermes is to be built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",
            "Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO, noted: “With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.”",
            "DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Assistant Secretary Dr Kathryn Huff said the Hermes reactor “is an important step toward realising advanced nuclear energy’s role in ushering forward the nation’s clean energy transition”. She added: “Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.”",
            "The KP-HFR is one of five teams selected in 2020 by the DOE to receive $30m in initial funding for risk reduction projects under the ARDP. The other projects were Westinghouse Electric Company’s eVinci Microreactor, the BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR), Holtec’s SMR-160 Reactor, and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment. DOE had earlier in 2020 selected TerraPower and X-energy to receive $160m in initial funding for ARDP Demonstration projects to develop two advanced nuclear reactors to be operational within seven years.",

        "text": [
            "US-based Kairos Power has completed 1,000 hours of pumped salt operations after loading 12 tonnes of FLiBe molten fluoride into its Engineering Test Unit (ETU) at its testing and manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. FLiBe comprises a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1969.",
            "The ETU and will be used to inform the design, construction, and operation of Kairos’s Hermes low-power reactor that the company is using to advance the development of its planned fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (KP-FHR). ETU, the largest FLiBe molten salt system ever built, is a non-nuclear prototype of the KP-FHR that aims to demonstrate the integration of principal systems, structures, and components. Lessons learned from ETU will be integrated into Hermes and future iterations on the path to commercialising KP-FHR technology. This advanced 140 MWe reactor will use TRISO (TRI-structural ISOtropic) fuel in pebble form combined with a low-pressure fluoride salt coolant. The technology employs a steam cycle to convert heat from fission into electricity and to complement renewable energy sources.",
            "Kairos Power manufactured 14 tonnes of FLiBe for ETU at its Molten Salt Purification Plant in Elmore, Ohio. “Gaining experience with FLiBe production and operations is fundamental to taking risk off the table towards KP-FHR commercialisation,” said Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO. “Iterative development with real hardware systems like ETU 1.0 is a pillar of our strategy to deliver a clean, safe, affordable technology with true cost certainty and, when combined with in-house manufacturing, provides a unique opportunity to move quickly so we can make an impact in the fight against climate change.”",
            "The Hermes project is part of the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Programme. Kairos Power plans to operate the ETU for about five months before decommissioning the unit and constructing a second iteration, ETU 2.0. The company plans to build a third iteration in Oak Ridge in 2024 to lay the groundwork for Hermes operations starting in 2026. Kairos optimistically says the KP-FHR commercial reactor could be operational in the early 2030s.",
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the c proposed Hermes non-power test reactor to be built at the Heritage Center Industrial Park in Oak Ridge. The permit authorises Kairos to build a 35 MWt reactor that would use molten salt to cool the reactor core. Kairos will have to submit a separate application for an operating licence.",

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has directed staff to issue a construction permit to Kairos Power for the company’s proposed Hermes non-power test reactor to be built at the Heritage Center Industrial Park in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The permit authorises Kairos to build a 35 MWt reactor that would use molten salt to cool the reactor core.",
            "Following a mandatory hearing, NRC authorised the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation to issue the permit, having found the staff’s review of the Kairos application adequate to make the necessary regulatory safety and environmental findings. The staff expects to issue the permit by the end of the month.",
            "Kairos submitted its construction permit application (CPA) for review in November 2021 to build the Hermes reactor in 2021. The test reactor, which will not generate electricity, is intended to provide operational data to support the development of a larger version for commercial power. NRC issued the final environmental impact statement for the site in August following the final safety evaluation for the permit in June. Kairos will have to submit a separate application for an operating licence.",
            "Kairos Power said the entire process took just over two years to complete and involved dozens of technical and topical reports which were developed, in part, with support from the US Department of Energy (DOE). “Kairos Power is thrilled to have achieved this major regulatory milestone as we make final preparations to start construction at the Hermes site next year,\" said Kairos co-founder & CEO Mike Laufer. \"We are excited for this next phase in the deployment of the Hermes reactor, and we remain committed to being a good community partner to our neighbours in Oak Ridge as we bring value to the region and build on its nuclear legacy.\"",
            "US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Kathryn Huff said this is “a huge milestone for the nuclear energy sector”. She added: “NRC’s approval of the first ever CPA granted to a Generation IV reactor charts a path forward for future design applications as we work toward deploying new reactor technologies. This accomplishment is a testament to the collaborative work among Kairos, the NRC, DOE and all stakeholders involved in the project.”",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s.",
            "Hermes is one of several new reactor technologies DOE is supporting through its Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. The low-power reactor uses a TRISO fuel pebble bed design with a molten fluoride salt coolant. The KP-FHR is based, in part, on DOE-sponsored Integrated Research Projects led by several universities, national labs, and international partners to advance fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactors.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",

The test reactor, which will not generate electricity, is intended to provide operational data for future developments. The 35 MWt Hermes demonstration reactor design was awarded $629m in cost-shared risk reduction funding over seven years by the US Department of Energy under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. A site has been selected for the demonstration reactor at the East Tennessee Technology Park in Oak Ridge, and TRISO fuel pebbles will be produced at the Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Low Enriched Fuel Fabrication Facility under an agreement reached in late 2022.",
            "Last July, Kairos applied to NRC for permission to build its Hermes 2 plant next to the Hermes reactor at Oak Ridge. Hermes 2 comprises two 35 MWt reactors, each the same size as the original test reactor, that share a power generation system. Hermes 2 is a non-power stepping stone towards deployment of the KP-FHR. The purpose of Hermes 2 is to further reduce risk on the path to commercialising the KP-FHR technology, demonstrating licensing, construction, operations, training, and decommissioning of a multi-reactor plant to help estimate the cost of the first commercial unit.",
            "Kairo said the final batch of FLiBe for ETU was delivered to the ETU in August. The FLiBe was produced at the Kairos Molten Salt Purification Plant (MSPP) on the Materion campus in Elmore, Ohio.",
            "“Being the first to build and operate a plant to produce FLiBe at an industrial scale has generated a wealth of lessons that will help de-risk salt production for future iterations,” Kairos noted.",
            "“As we accelerate our experience with large-scale FLiBe operations, establishing operating protocols, training personnel, and executing maintenance procedures, we learn important lessons to optimise plant operations for Kairos Power’s future nuclear iterations.” Once all 14 tonnes of FLiBe are circulating in ETU, operators will embark on a multi-month testing programme that will continue to provide data until the system is decommissioned to make way for the next iteration – ETU 2.0.",
            "Kairos said construction work has begun on the Modular Systems Facility, which will support ETU 2.0 subsystem development. ETU 2.0 is the first iteration to demonstrate modular construction, which provides a number of benefits. “By building each subsystem for ETU 2.0 as a modular skid, we will be able to complete entire subsystems and perform qualification testing in parallel before moving the skids into the ETU enclosure for assembly. This will enable us to advance ETU 2.0 construction while ETU 1.0 operations and decommissioning are still in progress.”",
            "Kairos is also producing “components from stainless steel and graphite, U-stamped pressure vessels, non-nuclear TRISO pebbles, and other specialised parts for our testing programme”. This includes construction of a vessel shop where we will make reactor vessels for future iterations, “along with the TRISO Development Lab, where we will advance fuel manufacturing techniques that will be implemented off-site to produce the fuel for Hermes”.",
            "The infrastructure and experience that Kairos Power is building in Albuquerque will directly support deployments in Tennessee, including the Hermes demonstration reactor, the company noted. “But Hermes won’t be our first hardware demonstration in Oak Ridge. In August, we announced that the third ETU iteration – ETU 3.0 – will be constructed on land owned by Kairos Power adjacent to the Hermes site at Heritage Centre Industrial Park.” Kairos Power plans to break ground at Heritage Centre in early 2024.",

            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. “While the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,” according to NEA. “Recent NEA analysis … finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.”",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

            "These include 10 water cooled reactors; four gas-cooled reactors; four fast reactors and two molten salt reactors. NEA also classifies them according to reactor configurations including 17 land-based designs; five multi-module designs; three marine-based designs; and one mobile design.",
            "NEA notes that SMRs can replace fossil fuels for on-grid power generation, diesel generators for off-grid mining and industrial operations, and fossil fuels for cogeneration of heat and power for heavy industries and district heating. They can also enable large-scale water treatment and desalination to produce clean potable water. “These varied market needs have prompted the development of a range of SMR technologies, which vary in technology, sizes, and configuration.” NEA comments: “Policymakers are often overwhelmed with this great variety as they strive to consider which designs might meet their particular needs and in what time frame.”",
            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci. Meanwhile, Russia’s KLT40S and China’s HTR-PM are already in operation.",
            "Much greater detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. This provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. The 424 pages provide details of the technologies involved while Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines. The first booklet in this series was first published in 2014 and serves as a supplement to the IAEA’s Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), an online database with comprehensive information on the latest developments in advanced reactors.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction to the latest edition: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",
            "All the other designs, including those mentioned by NEA, are either in the pre-conceptual/conceptual or basic/detailed design stages. Those still in the conceptual design stage include U Battery, eVinci, Nuward and Sealer-55.",
            "IAEA notes that the technical description and major technical parameters in the booklet “were provided by the design organisations without validation or verification by the IAEA. All figures, illustrations and tables in technical description of each design were also provided by the design organisations.” A similar caveat is given by NEA."

        "title": "US NRC accepts TRISO-X’s application for fuel fabrication facility",
        "text": [
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted an application from X-Energy Reactor Company subsidiary, TRISO-X, for a fuel fabrication facility which will use high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Anticipating the decision, TRISO-X, in October, broke ground and began construction of the facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (TF3) is expected to create more than 400 jobs and attract investment of approximately $300 million. TF3 is set to be commissioned and operational by 2025.",
            "In a letter to TRISO-X, NRC said that the agency had \"determined that the application provides sufficient information to proceed with a detailed technical review\" and further \"established a 30-month review schedule to be completed by June 2025.\"",
            "TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprises three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The coatings have uniform characteristics in all directions. Fuel particles, each the size of a poppy seed, are enriched to a level four times higher than fuel used in most of today’s commercial nuclear reactors. The coatings retain fission products, making each particle its own containment system. DOE says TRISO is “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth”.",
            "In 2020, the DOE selected X-energy for their Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to receive up to $1.2 billion of federal cost-shared funding to develop, license, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors by the end of the decade. The TRISO-X nuclear fuel produced in the Oak Ridge TF3 will be used in X-energy’s Xe-100 high-temperature gas reactors, which are expected to be operational by 2028. Since 2016, TRISO-X has operated a pilot-scale nuclear fuel fabrication facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to further develop its TRISO-X fuel and support the Xe-100 reactor design.",
            "“TRISO-X will be the nation’s first commercial scale facility dedicated to fuelling reactors that require high-assay low-enriched uranium TRISO particles,” said Dr Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy earlier this year. “It’s a job creator and an advanced reactor enabler that will help fuel a transition to a net-zero economy.”",
            "However, TRISO fuel development is also continuing at several of the US national laboratories. Earlier in December, BWX Technologies (BWXT) began production of TRISO nuclear fuel intended for the first US microreactor (Project Pele). Under a $37 million award from Idaho National Laboratory (INL), BWXT will manufacture a core for Project Pele, TRISO fuel for additional reactors and coated particle fuel for NASA. The fuel will be down-blended from US government stockpiles of HALEU and fabricated into TRISO fuel at BWXT’s facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. BWXT facilities are the only private US facilities licensed to possess and process highly enriched uranium.",
            "BWXT has expanded its specialty coated fuels production manufacturing capacity through previously announced awards funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) Operational Energy Capabilities Improvement Fund Office and NASA and programme management provided by DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office.",
            "Also in December, US-based Kairos Power signed an agreement to produce TRISO fuel pebbles for the Hermes demonstration reactor at Los Alamos National Laboratory’s (LANL’s) Low Enriched Fuel Fabrication Facility (LEFFF) in New Mexico. The partnership with Los Alamos is facilitated by the Laboratory’s proximity to Kairos Power’s testing and manufacturing facility in Albuquerque.",
            "In August, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) announced the opening of its Pilot Fuel Manufacturing (PFM) facility in Oak Ridge, located in the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), to produce the first fuel for testing and qualification for use in its Micro Modular Reactor (MMR). The PFM contains full scale production equipment for TRISO particles, and UNSC’s FCM Fuel. The privately owned facility is located on the Manhattan Project site previously occupied by the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. USNC produced its first uranium bearing TRISO particles earlier this year.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under ARDP, including two planned demonstration reactors – Terrapower’s Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors. However, the US is facing problems as domestic production is limited and previous supplies from Russia are no longer available.",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million and DOE has also established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio. However, Centrus Energy Corp is expected to be producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023. Terrapower has postponed its Natrium plans by two years because of the HALEU shortage. It remains to be seen whether the TRISO projects will be affected by this.",

I am proud of both teams’ commitment to collaborating in a public-private partnership to bring clean energy to market,” said Ed Blandford, Kairos Power Chief Technology Officer.",
            "Micah Hackett, Kairos Power Senior Director of Fuels and Materials, noted: “The iterative prototyping and innovation happening in Kairos Power’s Pebble Development Lab and our soon-to-be-commissioned TRISO Development Lab will be integral to our work with Los Alamos National Laboratory. With these early iterations, we are optimizing our processes and learning valuable lessons that will carry forward into our nuclear fuel program. We are thrilled to be partnering with Los Alamos to help bring Hermes to life.”",
            "Manufacturing fuel for Hermes in partnership with Los Alamos National Laboratory will allow Kairos Power to better control product quality, schedule, and cost, and yield experience that will inform future iterations in its nuclear fuel development program. The investment Kairos Power is making in the LEFFF aligns with the company’s vertical integration strategy to build a robust and reliable supply chain that will be key to delivering cost certainty for its future commercial products.",

        "text": [
            "US-based Oklo, developer of the 1.5MWe Aurora microreactor, has submitted a revised licensing project plan (LPP) to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which had denied a previous application in March 2020 “without prejudice”, citing Oklo’s “failure” to provide additional technical information related to the maximum credible accident and the safety classifications of the reactor’s systems, structures, and components (SSCs).",
            "This was the first-ever combined licence application (COLA) to NRC for an advanced non-light water reactor. However, NRC left the door open for Oklo to submit a revised application in the future. Oklo aims to build and operate an Aurora compact fast reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory site.",
            "Oklo's Aurora design is a fast neutron reactor that uses heat pipes to transport heat from the reactor core to a supercritical carbon dioxide power conversion system to generate electricity. The Aurora 'powerhouse' uses metallic high-assay low-enriched uranium (Haleu), fuel to produce about 1.5 MWe as well as useable heat.",
            "The new LPP is similar to regulatory engagement plans that other developers have developed. \"Oklo's reactor design has excellent safety characteristics and robust performance features,\" Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte said. \"We are working to present these features in a manner similar to what the NRC is used to from licensing light water reactors (LWRs).\"",
            "NRC requires five years or more to conduct a licence review and make safety determinations for large LWRs. To support advanced nuclear reactor deployment, the US Congress in the 2019 Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernisation Act (NEIMA) directed NRC to develop a performance-based, risk-informed, technology-inclusive licensing pathway for commercial reactors. NEIMA also requires NRC to develop a licensing process for advanced reactors that is “predictable, efficient, and timely”. NRC is currently developing a new licensing pathway, 10 CFR Part 53, and plans to complete this by the end of 2024.",
            "Meanwhile, several non-LWR advanced reactor developers, including Oklo and Kairos, are spearheading applications under NRC’s existing licensing pathways. NRC’s dismissal of Oklo’s previous COLA was unexpected. “Although Oklo responded to every request for information, and the last thing we heard from the NRC was that the information we submitted was helpful, the NRC has denied our first application on the basis of not having submitted information,” the company said in a blog post in January. “Yes, it was surprising. And there are elements that were frustrating and even angering.”",
            "However, it noted that NRC’s actions “are catalyzing a new wave of support, momentum, and introspection from those that support advanced fission”. It added: “This might not have happened in the same way had we proceeded on what we and everyone imagined would be a slow process of many smaller ‘paper cuts’.” Oklo said it would resubmit a COLA based on what it learned through the first review.",
