            "Reactor construction needs to offer ‘good technology and a good business case’",
            "The increased participation of global investment banks, state development and state-owned export-import banks is leading to a funding transformation for the nuclear energy sector, a conference in Bulgaria has heard.",
            "An international panel on financing nuclear power at the annual Bulgarian nuclear forum Bulatom’s conference on energy security in the Black Sea resort of Varna looked at the funding transformation for new nuclear plants in Bulgaria and internationally.",
            "The panel highlighted the increased participation of global investment banks, state development and state-owned export-import banks.",
            "“Money is available, but good projects are needed”, Milko Kovachev, Bulgaria’s energy minister from 2001-2005, and a former head of department at the International Atomic Energy Agency, told NucNet.",
            "“This means that new projects have to offer good technology and a good business case with returns, a good project structure is always a good sign,” said Kovachev, who also was one of the panellists on the financing nuclear new build panel at the conference.",
            "The Bulgarian energy minister Vladimir Malinov said at the conference that construction of new build nuclear plants such as Kozloduy-7 and -8, represents the most crucial project for the country’s economy, together with fuel diversification, as key mechanisms in Bulgaria’s ongoing transformation to low carbon and sustainable energy supply.",
            "Sofia is planning to build two Westinghouse-supplied AP1000s at the Kozloduy site, on the Danube River in the northwest of the country.",
            "Kovachev said investment banks such as Citibank and JP Morgan, both of which attended the Bulatom conference, are looking at nuclear power transactions and developing a deeper understanding of nuclear power as part of their decarbonisation portfolios, so they can increase their capacity for such deals.",
            "He said “lately, in 2024, we have realised that nuclear plants could get a new financial deal through green bonds, which could help refinancing projects”.",
            "As far as the role of the development banks is concerned, Kovachev said that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) “is the only international financial institution currently with unique expertise for nuclear safety upgrading programmes in a number of central and Eastern European countries”.",
            "“At the end of 2023, the bank reviewed  its energy strategy which does not include financing new builds, however it will continue to be focusing on projects for decommissioning, environmental remediation, safety upgrades including as fund manager in countries like Lithuania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Bulgaria,” Kovachev added.",
            "“The investment banks are also observing the SMR [small modular reactor] market,” said Kovachev, who is also a board member at the International Bank for Nuclear Infrastructure’s (IBNI) strategic advisory group. The IBNI is expected to be established between 2024 and 2026.  ",
            "“IBNI is needed in the global efforts to triple existing nuclear power capacity from 400 GW to 1,200 GW by 2050, as agreed at Cop28 in Dubai, as well as to sustain the level of standardisation and harmonisation, and to support investment from private and public funds,” Kovachev said.  ",
            "According to Kovachev, organisations like the European Investment Bank (EIB) can improve the financial environment for nuclear power plants, although the EIB does not currently support nuclear power.",
            "However, commercial banks now have decarbonisation portfolios as priority which is “advantageous to nuclear power”, Kovachev added.",

            "The UK government has earmarked Wylfa in north Wales as the site of a large-scale nuclear power station as it pushes ahead with ambitious plans for the biggest expansion of nuclear power for 70 years.",
            "Wylfa on the island of Anglesey – Ynys Môn in Welsh – has been named as the preferred site for the UK’s third major nuclear power station in a generation, coming after EDF’s Hinkley Point C, which is under construction in Somerset, and its Sizewell C nuclear project planned for Suffolk.",
            "The government said that it is already in discussion with major energy companies interested in building a nuclear station at Wylfa.",
            "Earlier this year the government set out plans to quadruple nuclear power generation to up to 24 GW by 2050, up from about 5.8 GW today.",

            "France’s state power company EDF said it was for the government to determine which nuclear reactor type is used at Wylfa but two more of its own EPR units would “be the surest choice” by “building on the skills and experience being developed at Hinkley Point and Sizewell”.",
            "The government said in a statement it is kickstarting talks with global energy firms to explore building the new power station, which could provide enough power for six million homes for 60 years. ",
            "“It brings the UK closer to its target for a quarter of electricity to come from homegrown nuclear power by 2050 to strengthen the nation’s energy independence,” the statement said.",
            "Claire Coutinho, the secretary of state for energy security and net zero, said the government was “powering ahead with the biggest expansion of nuclear energy in 70 years”.",
            "Coutinho said: “Anglesey has a proud nuclear history and it is only right that, once again, it can play a central role in boosting the UK’s energy security. Wylfa would not only bring clean, reliable power to millions of homes – it could create thousands of well-paid jobs and bring investment to the whole of north Wales.”",
            "In 2020, Hitachi, which owned the site until it was bought by Great British Nuclear (GBN), pulled out of a plan to build a nuclear station on the site. The Japanese company blamed a lack of funding from the UK government. ",
            "GBN is the government body designed to drive the delivery of new nuclear energy projects in the UK, including a fleet of small modular reactors.",
            "GBN recently secured Wylfa and Oldbury-on-Severn in Gloucestershire as two possible sites for new nuclear projects. It was the first time the government acquired land for new nuclear since the 1960s.",
            "The decision on the nuclear developer, and what type of technology should be used at Wylfa, will be made by GBN.",
            "Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the UK-based Nuclear Industry Association, said: “A large-scale project at Wylfa would be the single biggest inward investment in Welsh history, and a huge step towards both energy security and net zero for the whole country.”",
            "Sue Ferns, the senior deputy general secretary of the Prospect trade union, one of the UK’s largest, said: “Gigawatt scale new nuclear power stations are vital to hitting net zero and for our energy security. But they also maintain well-paid and highly skilled jobs, meaning this project would be a major boost to the Welsh economy.”",
            "“Now we need a laser-like focus on delivery of new nuclear to make sure skills and experience are not lost, and costs are reduced as we progress,” Ferns said.",
            "Wylfa is home to two gas-cooled Magnox plants that were permanently shut down in 2012 and 2015 and is seen as suitable site for large reactors or small modular reactors.",

            "However, a new governing coalition in Warsaw which took office in December 2023, has promised to review and update the nuclear programme by the end of 2024, partially in view of the need to update the schedule and possibly include small modular reactor developments.",
            "Local observers and experts had already suggested that 2026 had become an increasingly unrealistic construction kickoff target. First plant startup would also need to be pushed back from 2033 to 2035.",
            "Earlier this year, Milosz Motyka, deputy climate and environment minister, said that a one-year delay “is possible” in preparations for the construction of the nuclear station in the northern province of Pomerania.",
            "Motyka said that according to the 2020 Polish nuclear programme, the schedule was to issue an environmental decision by the end of 2022, which only happened in September 2023.",

Two more units, Khmelnitski-3 and -4 officially remain under construction, but both units were to be supplied by Russia and their status is unclear. Energoatom had said in 2021 that Khmelnitski-3 would be completed with VVER-1000 technology while Khmelnitski-4 would be an AP1000 unit.",

            "According to Energoatom, the construction of one reactor unit in peacetime takes five years and the estimated cost starts from $5bn (€4.6bn). The project will be partly financed by the US Export-Import (Exim) Bank. In July 2023 Westinghouse president of energy systems David Durham was reported as saying the company anticipated supporting Energoatom in developing a financing package with “substantial support” from the Exim Bank, Washington’s official credit agency.",
            "Ukraine existing fleet of 15 commercial nuclear reactors are of Soviet design, but it has shifted most of them to fuel provided by Westinghouse as the country continues its efforts to break away from dependence on Moscow and convert all its reactors to non-Russian fuel.",

What is often overlooked is that it has built up a portfolio of expertise in nuclear energy and nuclear technology that is largely still available today. Nuclear research began in Germany in the 1950s and until March 2011 it generated one-quarter of its electricity from nuclear energy with 17 reactors.",
            "According to KernD, Germany’s expertise in decommissioning has expanded in recent years with key players able to handle the entire portfolio of dismantling and decontamination services. Major companies such as Framatome, Westinghouse and Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service (GNS) are supported by numerous specialist companies that offer radiation protection, the operation of waste processing centres and documentation services. ",
            "“The fact that most European countries that use nuclear energy have abandoned phaseout policies and are continuing to extend the lifetimes of nuclear power plants means that this business area can continue to exist for quite a long time,” KernD said. ",
            "Almost one year ago, in April 2023, Germany took its last three nuclear reactors offline  in a decision that critics warned would only lead to more fossil fuels being burned to generate electricity. ",
            "Since the shutdowns, three political parties have called for a reversal of the anti-nuclear policy with leading members of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU) alliance and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) saying they want to restart decommissioned reactors and build new ones. ",
            "CDU leader Friedrich Merz has said that shutting down the last reactors was a “black day for Germany”. The parties also say that old reactors should be reconnected to the grid. Merz says that the country should restart the last three power plants that were shut down — citing climate protection, as well as rising oil and gas prices.",
            "Germany’s nuclear industry also stands ready to make a significant contribution in the market for services related to new build. ",
            "“The major challenge for the western nuclear industry is to build [nuclear plants] on time and on budget,” Wendler said. “Streamlining construction, tightening quality control and having a reliable and precise supply chain is what the German industry should develop.",
            "Wendler noted that Framatome and Westinghouse subsidiaries in Germany have been involved in new build projects. The Olkiluoto-3 construction project in Finland was in effect run from Germany with Areva NP and Siemens as the main contractors, he said.",
            "Anglo-German-Dutch uranium enricher Urenco operates a plant in Gronau, northwest Germany, which accounts for about 17% of Europe’s uranium enrichment capacity. This places Germany among the few countries that have centrifuge technology, a fundamental pillar of the nuclear industry supply chain.",
            "One of the strengths of German industry is that it has a tight-knit network of companies and research institutions that can bring knowhow to all sorts of engineering and manufacturing problems.",
            "“The industry has been moving towards international markets in all areas, not just nuclear decommissioning, which itself has grown in importance and now is by far the most important {nuclear power} business within Germany,” Wendler said.",
            "“Many companies are seeking people to hire for a buildup in engineering and manufacturing capacities. This is due to a growing international market that has been energised by both the drive for political climate action and the geopolitical upheaval in consequence of the war in Ukraine.”",
            "In principle, said Wendler, there is a place for Germany in the development of new nuclear technologies such as small modular reactors, although “this will depend on which SMRs we are talking about”. ",
            "Traditional light-water reactor designs based on the general type that have operated in Germany for decades could be supplied and supported by German supply chains. This means German industry could potentially work well for the Westinghouse AP300 SMR, GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 and the SMR being developed by Rolls-Royce in the UK.",
            "“As for advanced reactors it is difficult to tell,” Wendler said. “I know that there are component manufacturers already developing parts or sub-systems for advanced reactors and the analytical and development capabilities available in Germany can be useful in this area.” ",
            "There are hopeful signals for the continuation of federal R&D funding for nuclear fusion. Earlier this month, Germany said it wants to build a “nuclear fusion ecosystem” made up of industry, startups and science so that a fusion power plant in the country becomes a reality as quickly as possible with a target of having a reactor in operation by 2040 – potentially making it among the first in Europe.",
            "“There is still room for improvement by broadening the range of government funded research topics,” Wendler said. “The German nuclear industry is prepared for this.”",
            "The cautiously bullish mood is helped by public opinion. Despite sometimes being against domestic large-scale nuclear, it always has been in favour of German owned or Germany-based companies developing and exporting nuclear technology, Wendler said.",
            "Germany closed its last nuclear power plants in April 2023​ as part of the Energiewende (energy transition) policy, which aims to shift the country towards renewable energy sources. Berlin had the second largest nuclear fleet in Europe.",
            "Neckarwestheim-2 was among the three nuclear plants to be finally shuttered on 15 April 2023."

            "Warsaw planning update 2020 energy programme to ‘strengthen position of nuclear’",
            "There is no alternative to deploying nuclear power for Poland’s future energy mix and to help secure baseload generation against intermittent renewables, Milosz Motyka undersecretary of state in the ministry of climate and the environment, told a panel discussion on Monday 18 March.",
            "“If not nuclear, then what? Not coal, there is no alternative,” Motyka told the Baltic Nuclear Energy Forum in the city of Gdansk, about 100 km southeast of Poland’s proposed first nuclear station at Lubiatowo-Kopalino on the Baltic coast.",
            "The cost of basing the Polish economy on coal-fired generation will be increasingly higher in the coming years and “it’s not worth it” for the economy and the environment, he said.  ",
            "Asked about renewable energy sources, Motyka said nuclear will secure the baseload of power generation and the stability of the energy system against the intermittent nature of wind and solar.",
            "“There is no alternative to the stability of the system like nuclear energy,” Motyka said.",
            "He said the government wants to update a 2020 nuclear energy programme by the end of this year – an update that will “strengthen the position of nuclear”, according to Motyka. The update is also expected to include progress on small modular reactors, according to earlier reports.",
            "In November 2022, Warsaw chose Westinghouse to supply its AP1000 pressurised water reactor technology for the country’s first nuclear power station, a three-unit facility at Lubiatowo-Kopalino in Pomerania, northern Poland.",
            "In late 2023, Westinghouse formed a consortium with US partner Bechtel for the project. Geological studies at the new-build site are set to start this spring.",
            "Financing, however, remains uncertain, with the government yet to make public a final decision.",
            "Government officials recently said Warsaw is looking at a contracts for difference (CfD) scheme. Earlier options included attracting equity from a co-investor or debt financing.",
            "According to Bogdan Pilch, director of the Polish Chamber of Power Industry and Environmental Protection, equity financing may be a “wrong” option because it is “always the most expensive method” of financing.",
            "Pilch added that another related issue may be the loss of full control over the project, which better remain under the ownership of a single Polish company. Currently, this is project company Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe, owned by the Polish state.",
            "Robert Rudich, energy attaché at the US embassy in Warsaw, said the decision on financing rests with the Polish government.",
            "He said: “A lot of the concepts that were developed to try and bring some degree of US equity as opposed to subsidised debt financing are probably not the most economical way to finance this project.",
            "“I don’t want to give the impression that we are backtracking on anything, because everything that we have put on the table is absolutely on the table,” Rudich said.",
            "He said the US Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) has sent a letter of interest for “a very large number of billions of dollars” to support Poland’s first nuclear project. “That is probably the lowest-cost debt financing available and it is an immensely powerful tool that we are bringing to this strategic project.”",
            "In 2020, Warsaw signed in 2020 an agreement with the Exim Bank to finance projects supporting climate change in Poland, including potential new reactors. Models of financing by the Exim Bank, the US Development Financial Corporation, and equity capital by Westinghouse and Bechtel formed part of an offer for the first nuclear station presented to Poland by the US ambassador\r\nin September 2022. ",
            "Poland wants to have between 6 GW and 9 GW of commercial nuclear power at up to two sites in the early 2040s under its current nuclear power programme adopted in 2020.",

            "The facility would require minimal site preparation when compared to a site-constructed small modular reactor (SMR). Since the TNPP would arrive at site more ready for final commissioning, power generation could begin in a matter of weeks. At the end of project life, the TNPP would be removed for decommissioning, eliminating legacy waste.",

            "The future of the Wylfa site has been uncertain since Hitachi officially abandoned plans to build a new reactor there in September 2020 after failing to strike a financial agreement with the British government.",
            "The Japanese industrial group eventually wrote off £2.1bn on the project and also stopped planning for new reactors at the Oldbury site, which is also owned by Hitachi. Oldbury has two gas-cooled Magnox plants that were permanently shut down in 2011 and 2012.",
            "The Wylfa site had been valued at £200m, according to the Financial Times, which first reported the talks between Hitachi and GBN.",
            "Wylfa is home to two gas-cooled Magnox plants that were permanently shut down in 2012 and 2015 and is seen as suitable site for large reactors or small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "“Wylfa at Ynys Môn has a vital role in delivering our nuclear ambitions,” Hunt said.",
            "“We want nuclear to provide up to 25% of UK electricity by 2050 and I want the UK to lead the global race in developing cutting edge nuclear technologies.”",
            "The UK’s SMR programme, unveiled in the Great British Nuclear Roadmap at the beginning of this year, also received a boost in today’s budget speech, with Hunt declaring the second stage of the selection process for developers to bid for tenders.",
            "“Great British Nuclear will begin next phase of small modular reactor selection process with companies having until June to submit their initial tender responses,” Hunt said.",
            "The UK government is running a competition for companies to design and build SMRs. In October it selected six companies to advance to the next phase of the competition. The companies are: Westinghouse, EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power and Rolls-Royce SMR.",
            "Separately, Westinghouse has signed an agreement with Community Nuclear Power that could lead to the deployment of the UK’s first privately financed SMR fleet using Westinghouse’s AP300 technology. The first plant could begin commercial operation by the early 2030s.",
            "In January, the UK government set out plans for what it claimed will be Britain’s biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years with the possible construction of about 11 new reactors by 2050 – enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand.",
            "Ministers published a roadmap that recommitted the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24 GW by 2050 – an increase from around 5.8 GW today.",

            "The Bulgarian government’s choice of South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction\r\n(Hyundai E&C) to build the proposed Kozloduy-7 and -8 AP1000 units is a well-thought-out decision, but a 15 April deadline imposed by the Bulgarian National Assembly on 26 February for starting negotiations on the contract seems too close, a nuclear power expert has said.     ",
            "“Hyundai E&C signed a partnership agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company in May 2022 and are looking to expand their cooperation in Europe,” said Milko Kovachev, Bulgaria’s energy minister from 2001-2005, and a former head of department at the International Atomic Energy Agency, speaking to NucNet on 28 February.",
            "Over the last 10 years, the South Koreans have been looking at opportunities to work in Europe in compliance with EU regulation, he said.  This means the choice made by the Bulgarian government to choose Hyundai E&C cannot come as a surprise. ",
            "“I personally look at it as a continuation of the previous relations between WEC [Westinghouse] and Hyundai E&C,” Kovachev said. “In addition, South Korean companies have a good record for project completion on time and on budget.”",
            "The invitation for expressions of interest for construction was specifically related to the construction of Kozloduy-7, as the first priority in new nuclear construction in the country, Rumen Radev, the Bulgarian energy minister, said in a statement 22 January. ",
            "“Bechtel [which unsuccessfully bid for the project] is WEC’s partner in countries like Poland, but US companies do agreements with no lump sum, fixed price contracts, while the Bulgarian authorities have specified that they want the Kozloduy-7 AP1000 to be completed in 60 months, and Kozloduy-8 in 54 months at a fixed price, a parameter that a US company does not normally sign,” Kovachev said. ",
            "“Meanwhile, South Korean companies offer this type of contractual commitment,” he said.  ",
            "In May 2022, Hyundai signed an agreement with Westinghouse to jointly participate in global AP1000 plant opportunities. The company was also part of a South Korean consortium that built four nuclear reactor units at the Barakah nuclear power station in the United Arab Emirates using South Korea’s APR1400 technology.",
            "Kovachev said that in this case, the Bulgarian client, Kozloduy New Build wants to ensure predictability and security, as the user’s point of view is to sell electricity at a competitive price. ",
            "In addition, last year the Bulgarian government has said that the price per block cannot exceed €6-6.5bn ($6.5-7bn).  ",
            "The financing of the construction of Kozloduy-7 is set to be primarily sourced from a few commercial banks, covering 70% of the project, with the Bulgarian government contributing the remaining 30%, according to Valentin Nikolov, the chief executive of the Kozloduy nuclear power station. ",
            "Following press reports earlier this week about the possibility of the European Investment Bank (EIB) backing nuclear power, an EIB spokesperson confirmed to NucNet on 28 February that “according to existing EIB rules, nuclear energy projects are eligible for EIB financing”.",
            "“In fact, we just supported a nuclear project in December last year with €145 million to facilitate the construction of Europe’s first tritium removal facility in Romania, thereby reducing radioactive waste and greatly enhancing health and safety,” the EIB spokesperson added. ",
            "Historically, the EIB has had a lending policy which is supportive to nuclear power, but it did not invest in it, as its shareholders, countries like Germany and France, have opposite opinions, Kovachev noted.",
            "“In recent press reports, the EIB spoke about funding SMRs [small modular reactors] only for now, but Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic are interested to get financing for their NPPs, regardless of their reactor type choice,” said Kovachev.",
            "Kozloduy is Bulgaria’s only commercial nuclear power station. There are two 1,000-MW Russia-designed VVER units already in operation at the site and four older VVER units that have been permanently shut down. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Kozloduy’s two operating units provide about a third of the Bulgaria’s electricity generation.",

            "DESNZ expects to receive bids this month into SMR tender from shortlisted companies   ",
            "The UK government is planning to play a larger role in the country’s nuclear power industry in order to offset uncertainties in the energy market, Chris Heffer, the director of nuclear power at the country’s department of energy security and net zero (DESNZ), said at an industry event on 23 February.",
            "Heffer cited as evidence of this commitment the government’s investment of around €4.10bn (£3.50bn, $4.45bn) in the planned 3,260-MW Sizewell C nuclear plant in eastern England, the ongoing competition organized by DESNZ to select at least one small modular reactor (SMR) design for deployment in the UK by the early 2030s and investment through the government’s future nuclear enabling fund (FNEF) in enhancing fuel fabrication and uranium conversion capacity in the UK.",
            "Sizewell C is currently 51% owned by the UK government and 49% owned by French state nuclear power company EDF. The plant will comprise two 1.6-GW French EPR reactors and be built on a site adjacent to the existing 1,250-MW Sizewell B pressurised water reactor (PWR), the only PWR in the UK.  ",
            "Heffer said that “We expect a Final Investment Decision (FID) on Sizewell C by the end of this year,” adding that the country already had a “fuel manufacturing and production site in Springfields” outside Preston in northern England, owned by Westinghouse, where the government had already invested €15, 2 million (£13 million) from the FNEF to help develop uranium conversion capacity at the Springfields facility.",
            "Heffer added that the creation of the Great British Nuclear (GBN) government-owned entity to oversee the SMR competition and the government’s investment in Sizewell C demonstrate “a stronger role for the government in the UK nuclear sector. Energy security is also security for the UK.”",
            "He also said that “building a coherent system is the UK government approach [to the nuclear energy industry] rather than bits here and there.”",
            "He implied that currently the UK has got a system with bits here and there unlike the French one, but this is now changing. ",
            "Heffer also noted that high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) would be an “important addition to the market and that there are some [important] commercial or technological decisions” to soon be made on Haleu.",
            "Speaking during the same event on 23 February, Guy Esnouf, GBN’s director of communications, said that GBN has a “role on the planning, regulations and siting” of SMRs in the UK, through its oversight of the SMR competition. ",
            "Esnouf also said that GBN was “putting the contract together” to select at least one SMR design for deployment in the UK, and that GBN would also “set up development companies” to establish and construct SMRs in the UK, using the designs selected in the competition. ",
            "He added that the UK government and GBN hoped that an FID would be made on the first SMR to be deployed in the UK by 2029. ",
            "“The key timeline is FID by the end of 2029, that is really important, this is urgent,” Esnouf said. ",
            "GBN is working on SMR siting “during the first half of 2024, we will look to find and purchase sites or the reactor developers will develop their own sites. We are looking at sites and are focused on areas with nuclear experience,” Esnouf noted. ",
            "GBN would “look to place at least one or two SMRs at sites” that it selected for deployment, but GBN and the UK government really “want to build a fleet of SMRs” according to Esnouf. ",
            "“We need to take advantage of modularity to get quicker and more reliable development” of SMRs, Esnouf also said. ",
            "“We need to learn how to build a fleet and need to go beyond one or two sites,” he added. ",
            "In the second half of last year, the UK government has selected six SMR companies to continue to the next phase of a competition to design and build small modular reactors.",
            "These companies include EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. ",
            "The next bid expected, but not confirmed, as early as end of this month will secure the second round of the pre-selection process. ",
            "The DESNZ had said at the first selection round that the designs were “the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s”.",
            "The UK wants new nuclear to play role in its future net-zero energy transition as its ageing reactor fleet is preparing for retirement over the next decade."

            "Falchi said “EDF is looking forward to see an overall roadmap for nuclear power in the UK, so that the country can reach serial production of the same reactor.” Such a roadmap should also include information on the potential location of new units in the country, she added. ",
            "Realising the promise of SMRs is a priority, including the delivery, cost and use of UK made nuclear fuel, said Rory O'Neil, director of government affairs, Westinghouse UK. He added that “there will be a global supply chain” for SMRs.  ",
            "“SMR procurement and [SMR] competition work is GBN’s most high profile workstream, although I also have AMR [advanced nuclear reactor] responsibilities”, said Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN’s interim chief executive officer at the annual Nuclear Industry Association conference in London earlier this month. ",
            "She said that maximising the ability to put nuclear power on the grid is key, as well as the need to work with a future system operator. A further priority is “the use of regulation and creation of a system for modularisation”, of new nuclear units, she added. “The nuclear roadmap, which is expected in January 2024, is built on specific points,” she said. ",
            "GBN is also planning to publish documents about siting principles and routes to markets, along with the nuclear roadmap. ",

            "Renaud Crassous, Nuward’s president, has said in a press interview that the aim of the Nuward reactor design is to “fully integrate catalysts for success” of this SMR design, such as innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production, thus speeding the start of the construction of the first SMR. ",
            "The French nuclear safety regulator, as well as the Czech and Finnish regulators, are now collaborating for a pilot European early joint regulatory review of the Nuward design. EDF is cooperating with Italian companies on SMR development to achieve a standard for the European market.  ",
            "EDF, which holds the majority ownership of the Italian energy company Edison, signed a letter of intent earlier this year with Italy's Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo Nucleare and Edison to assess potential industrial cooperation for the development of nuclear power in Europe, especially SMRs.",
            "According to the French SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a first SMR is scheduled to begin in 2026, while the construction of the first unit is expected to take around three years after first concrete is laid in 2030. ",

            "The company’s Inside Green Innovation: Progress Report Third Edition – which analyses global patent filings across several key environmental issues, including nuclear power – shows a 50% year-on-year increase in patent filings, from 107 to 159, to 2021.",
            "Appleyard Lees said such innovation investment has not been seen in the sector since 2004-2005 and the start of the Millennium, with companies in Asian countries including Japan, South Korea and China leading the charge. ",
            "The findings come as 22 countries signed a pledge at Cop28 in Dubai to triple nuclear generation capacity by 2050 from a base year of 2020 at the UN’s Climate Change Conference in Dubai. This will involve inviting shareholders of international financial institutions to encourage the inclusion of nuclear energy in lending policies.",
            "Appleyard Lees partner and patent attorney, Richard Bray said that while patent filings for nuclear fusion and fission peaked in the 1970s and 80s – falling significantly through the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s – data from 2021 shows the start of a potential upward trend in filing activity not seen since 2000-2001.",
            "“It will be interesting to see if this trend continues… and which companies are leading this renewed period of innovation and patent filing. It is an exciting time for the nuclear industry as a whole.”",
            "According to the Fusion Industry Association, investment in the fusion sector has now reached over $6bn globally, with at least $4.2bn (€3.8bn) invested in the last two years. The single, largest investment in fusion energy was $1.8bn to US-based fusion reactor developer Commonwealth Fusion Systems, in 2022. Commonwealth Fusion Systems now has total declared funding of more than $2bn. ",
            "Appleyard Lees said many companies receiving recent investment are targeting fusion power to grid by 2030. ",
            "It said the stand-out area of fusion innovation, as shown by the patent data, is in magnets and magnetic properties, essential components in existing fusion reactor designs. Since 2018, there has been an increase in new patent filings for high temperature superconductors – potentially seen as game changing for numerous industries. Prime movers include UK-based Tokamak Energy, with two-thirds of its patent applications covering this type of technology, and the Korean Electrotechnology Research Institute, which tops the list with 11 patent filings in 2021. ",
            "Innovation in nuclear fission is most visible in small modular reactors. Patent filings relating to this technology jumped by 100% from 2019-2020 (from 19 to 38) and fell only marginally in 2021. ",
            "“While the previous innovation spike in SMRs is attributed to the 2011 Fukushima nuclear incident, the latest resurgence appears driven by interest in the microreactor concept, with offer smaller footprints than SMRs, and the capacity to produce up to 10 MW,” Appleyard Lees said.",
            "Notable patent filers in SMR and microreactors include large organisations such as Westinghouse, Korea Atomic Energy and Rolls-Royce. However, smaller companies – such as Nuscale and Terrapower, founded by Bill Gates – also appear in the list.",

            "Around Europe, companies signed deals related to all stages of SMR development and deployment. Companies in Poland and the Czech Republic have announced SMR programmes. Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

Funding for the project was signed off by Boris Johnson at the start of September in one of his last acts as prime minister and confirmed by chancellor Jeremy Hunt in his autumn statement. The twin EPR station is a joint endeavour with French state energy giant EDF and is expected to take a decade to build at the cost of between £20-£30bn. Large-scale reactors are under construction or consideration around the world. Test production has begun at Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Flamanville-3 in France is close to completion, while fuel is being loaded at Vogtle in the US. Construction continued at Akkuyu, Turkey’s first nuclear station, with a second under consideration. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, around 30 countries are considering or embarking on the construction of new reactors. They include established nuclear nations such as the UK, France, Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, China and India, and newcomers such as Poland, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Indonesia. The International Energy Agency says a new wave of construction will be key to achieving net zero and ensuring energy security.  ",

            "Repowering existing coal plant infrastructure – including with small modular reactors – is the largest single carbon abatement opportunity on the planet and could greatly accelerate the clean energy transition while using existing infrastructure and maintaining vital jobs and a major topic to watch in 2023 and beyond. A report by TerraPraxis said replacing coal-fired boilers at existing coal plants with carbon-free SMRs, also known as advanced heat sources, would transform coal-fired power plants from polluting liabilities facing an uncertain future, into a central component of a clean energy system transition – an important part of the massive and pressing infrastructure buildout needed to address climate change. The US Department of Energy said This “coal-to-nuclear” transition could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping the US reach its net-zero emissions goals by 2050. TerraPower, a company co-founded by Bill Gates, plans to deploy its Natrium reactor technology at a coal site in the US state of Wyoming. In Poland Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began investigating the site of coal plant in southern Poland for the construction of APR1400 nuclear power plants.

Westinghouse had indeed made offers in July and September 2022 for a set of six of its AP1000 PWR units.",
            "Some Polish media have said that it is likely today’s agreement with KHNP will be additional to Warsaw’s stated plans to deploy up to six units under its 2020 programme, but the claims could not be officially confirmed.",
            "Last year, Piotr Naimski, at the time secretary of state for strategic energy infrastructure, said\r\nthe coal plant of Belchatow, in central Poland, could be chosen as a location for a second nuclear power station, naming Patnow, about 150 km to the northwest, as a possible third site.",
            "In September 2021, ZE PAK, which is the largest private energy firm in Poland, signed an agreement with Synthos Green Energy to explore the deployment of a GE Hitachi BWRX-300 small modular reactor at Patnow. The company said at the time it wanted to invest in four to six SMRs with a capacity of 300 MW each.",

            "Mr Gajda said a decision on reactor technology is needed to proceed to the next stages of the project – to prepare final project and to prepare the safety report and all the other documents necessary to obtain the permit from the Polish Atomic Energy Agency [PAA]”.",
            "He said the financial element of the project will be a challenge. ",
            "“There are expectations from all potential partners that the offers will include an option of financing such as taking up shares or granting loans,” Mr Gajda said.",
            "The Polish government is negotiating with potential partners about financing the project. Piotr Naimski, secretary of state and plenipotentiary of the Polish government for strategic energy infrastructure,  said recently: “We are talking about large amounts of money, but to be managed by the Polish state.”",
            "Poland wants to build from 6,000 to 9,000 MW of installed nuclear capacity based on proven, large-scale, pressurised water reactor technology. Commercial operation of a first unit in a proposed set of six is planned for 2033.",
            "Offers have been submitted by France’s state-owned EDF and South Korea’s Korea Hydro Nuclear Power, a subsidiary of state-owned Korea Electric Power Corporation. A bid from US company Westinghouse is expected by the end of September. ",
            "Mr Gajda, who also serves as secretary-general of the Polish Nuclear Society and in the board of directors of European Nuclear Society, said three factors could be decisive when Poland makes a decision: who will offer the better funding package and model; the level of participation of Polish industry so that as much investment as possible stays in Poland; and cooperation between suppliers. ",
            "“Regardless of which technology we choose, all three suppliers will participate in this project,” he said. “For example, consider the [Barakah nuclear power station] project in the United Arab Emirates, which was implemented by South Korea. Westinghouse has been involved there”. ",
            "Westinghouse provided technical assistance and licensing work for the Barakah project and has signed support agreements with Barakah operator Nawah Energy. Korea Electric Power Corporation (Kepco) agreed recently with Westinghouse to explore ways to cooperate on international nuclear power generation markets, with South Korea saying it plans to export 10 nuclear power plants by 2030.",
            "Mr Gajda said nuclear projects carry “geopolitical weight” and he believes that for this reason Poland does not want China and Russia involved in the project, despite fact that that they are very active in new-build projects around the world, especially in emerging markets like the Middle East or Africa. He said China and Russia offer good financing conditions, but in exchange for influence or access to raw materials and other elements. “It is a new variation of colonialism in a sense,” he said, adding “it is important to be associated with a partner that is politically credible”.",
            "Another challenge Poland faces is the need to build up human resources for the licensing of planned reactors. Mr Gajda said Warsaw has about two years to build up staff, but the Polish Atomic Energy Agency has “already taken steps to strengthen personnel”. This year it increased its budget for staff with reactor assessment tasks.",
            "Poland’s bullishness on nuclear is also seen in the fact that a number of large Polish enterprises have signed agreements on small modular reactors, which they see as to help decarbonise the energy sector. Synthos Green Energy, PKN Orlen and KGHM have all announced plans to deploy SMRs, with the first unjit scheduled to be built in 2029. ",
            "Mr Gajda said: “I believe in SMR technology, but not in the dates given by the companies.” ",
            "He said the most advanced technology is US-based NuScale’s with the Carbon Free Power Project in Idaho. “They’ve already got a site report filed and they’re supposed to apply for a construction licence in early 2024” he said. “So, they are many steps ahead of the Polish projects. The CFPP project is scheduled be operational in 2030.”",
            "Mr Gajda said estimated capital expenditure for the first NuScale BWRX-300 SMR in Poland of €1.1bn is “optimistic”. He said “nobody knows how much SMRs – or large-scale nuclear plants – will cost, but this uncertainty is much greater in projects that haven’t built a prototype yet”.  ",
            "“We see what is happening on international markets in terms of the prices of materials and these are elements that will affect projects.”",
            "Component manufacturers point to rising prices for electricity and materials such as steel. In addition, the recovery of global economies from the Covid-19 pandemic means there is a shortage of raw materials, a situation that has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. ",

            "\"It is using the DNA of the AP1000 in terms of technology\", he said, with its passive safety systems \"which has unique advantages in terms of robustness of the safety case, simplicity of the design, with huge implications in terms of costs and time to construct and obviously an ease of deployment because, with the AP1000 being already deployed, the AP300 SMR will leverage the existing supply chain, the existing design, the existing licensing pedigree\".",
            "\"It is no more and no less than an AP1000 with one loop instead of two loops - which means it's effectively reusing a majority of components, systems, equipment. The fuel is identical, the constructability lessons are identical,\" he said.",
            "Westinghouse was bringing \"certainty\" to the SMR market in terms of a proven design, existing supply chains and economics, he said. Market soundings over recent months and discussions with potential customers had led the company to believe this was an \"inflection point\" for the market.",
            "In a press conference following the announcement, Westinghouse also said the footprint of the AP300 would be about 25% of the area of a football (soccer) pitch, with a target cost per unit of USD1 billion.",
            "Fragman said that the timeline was aiming to get licensing approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 2027 \"given the existing maturity of the design and reuse of the building blocks of licensing\", followed by three years to get site-specific permissions and a further three years for construction \"which means that in 10 years from now the first AP300 SMR will effectively deliver its first power to the grid\".",
            "The company believes that the customer base for the SMR will be broader than existing utility customers, and will include uses such as hydrogen production, district heating, water desalination and providing power for data centres.",
            "David Durham, President Energy Systems at Westinghouse, said that the initial licensing focus was on design certification from the NRC: \"That's typically the kind of stamp of approval around the world - we will be pursuing, though, licensing in other countries over the coming next couple of years\".",
            "Westinghouse has named Rita Baranwal, currently Chief Technology Officer, to lead the team developing the AP300 SMR. Baranwal is a former Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy at the US Department of Energy, and a previous director of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear initiative at Idaho National Lab.",
            "The AP300 SMR will sit between the AP1000 and the eVinci microreactor, a range of products which, the company said, together with other developments, meant Westinghouse was providing \"the technology to create a sustainable future and enhance energy security around the globe and eventually in outer space\".",

            "\"This investment from the Nuclear Fuel Fund is a vote of confidence in the capabilities of our Springfields manufacturing site,\" said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. \"We are excited for the future of nuclear energy in the UK and the role Westinghouse will continue to play in its success.\"",
            "\"Nuclear power is at the heart of our plan to deliver cleaner, more secure home-grown energy to the UK, boosting our energy security and will provide highly skilled jobs to grow our economy,\" said UK Minister for Nuclear Andrew Bowie. \"The GBP10.5 million government funding to Westinghouse's Springfields plant will support their development of new fuel technologies, essential to the development of the next generation of nuclear reactors, as well as supporting highly skilled jobs in Preston and across the North West.\"",
            "Following consultation with the industry, barriers to investment in the UK nuclear fuel sector were identified, including: the high upfront costs of establishing new facilities and product lines; uncertainties regarding the long-term makeup of future fuel demand, particularly with regard to the emergence of advanced reactor technologies; costs and timelines associated with siting and licensing of new nuclear fuel facilities and products and a shortage of nuclear and engineering skills.",
            "In January, the UK government began accepting bids for up to GBP50 million (USD60 million) funding for projects it hopes will \"stimulate a diverse and resilient nuclear fuel market\" in the country. Bids were accepted up to 20 February. The Nuclear Fuel Fund is intended to provide greater options for UK nuclear operators to use UK-produced fuel, as the country seeks to diversify its uranium and nuclear fuel production capacity away from Russia.",
            "The fund is also intended to \"support projects establishing new domestic fuel capabilities, which could include fuel supply options for light water reactors, including future small modular reactors, that could support much of our current nuclear energy needs. It will also look to support projects producing new fuel types which will be needed to supply advanced modular reactors, likely to be in operation from the 2030s, such as high assay low enriched uranium\".",

            "How a Prodigy Microreactor Power Station might look (Image: Westinghouse)",
            "In a blog post, Westinghouse said the two companies had been collaborating since 2019 to evaluate deployment models for the eVinci microreactor. It said a \"multinational corporation operating strategic critical minerals assets in Canada\" had funded a study in 2019-2020 to identify reliable clean energy sources which led Prodigy to \"pioneer the development of TNPP civil structures standardised for deployment at a wide range of sites\".",
            "The eVinci microreactor is described as a \"small battery\" for decentralised generation markets and for microgrids, such as remote communities, remote industrial mines and critical infrastructure. The nominal 5 MWe heat pipe reactor, which has a heat capability of 14 MWt, features a design that Westinghouse says provides competitive and resilient power as well as superior reliability with minimal maintenance. The Prodigy Microreactor Power Station can integrate a single or multiple eVinci microreactors, would be prefabricated and transported to a site for installation at the shoreline or on land.",
            "The two companies signed an agreement in 2022, and with conceptual engineering and regulatory studies completed the next steps include \"completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project in Canada by 2030\".",
            "Jon Ball, eVinci Technologies President for Westinghouse, said: \"From the start, our eVinci technology was designed to be transportable, that was a key design principle. So, we designed it to be small, we made it plug-and-play, and we made it deliverable to anywhere. The TNPP from Prodigy brings an additional value to the inherent transportability of the technology.\"",
            "Mathias Trojer, president and CEO of Prodigy Clean Energy, said: \"The eVinci microreactor’s compact design and simplified operating requirements make it optimal for integration into a Prodigy TNPP. Our technology will enable fleet deployment of the eVinci, accelerating the timeline to deliver clean, reliable and affordable power at commercial scale to remote regions.\"",
            "As well as a microreactor power station, Prodigy is also developing a larger version, a small modular reactor (SMR) power plant, deployable at the shoreline \"ideal for coal replacement and grid-scale power generation\". In October 2022, it unveiled a conceptual design for an SMR Marine Power Station, developed with NuScale, which could house between one and twelve NuScale Power Modules.",
            "Prodigy says that with both TNPPs it packages the microreactors or SMR into the prefabricated and relocatable power plant structures and transports them to their site, and removes them at the end of life after 60 years, so \"simplify the full facility lifecycle, dramatically reducing new build costs and complexity\".",

            "Waste management issues need to have a significantly greater prominence in the process of developing and deploying small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor designs, according to the UK's Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM).",
            "The six contenders in the UK SMR contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "\"There is considerable impetus for the development of small modular reactor (SMR) and advanced modular reactor (AMR) designs and their commercial deployment, both for energy security and for environmental reasons, particularly given the historic difficulties of deploying reactors at gigawatt scale,\" CoRWM notes in a new",
            "However, it says the issue of managing the used fuel and radioactive waste from these new reactors \"appears, with some exceptions ... to have been largely ignored or at least downplayed up to now\". It adds that the issue \"must be considered when selecting technologies for investment, further development, construction and operation\".",
            "The paper says: \"This must involve addressing the uncertainties about such management at an early stage, to avoid costly mistakes which have been made in the past, by designing reactors without sufficient consideration of how spent fuel and wastes would be managed, and also to provide financial certainty for investors regarding lifetime costs of operation and decommissioning.\"",
            "CoRWM says it is essential to know: the nature and composition of the waste and, in particular, of the used fuel; its likely heat generation and activity levels; how it could feasibly be packaged and its volume; and when it is likely to arise.",
            "\"So far there is little published material from the promoters and developers of new reactor types to demonstrate that they are devoting the necessary level of attention to the waste prospectively arising from SMR/AMRs,\" it notes.",
            "The position paper provides recommendations to the UK government, Great British Nuclear (GBN), and Nuclear Waste Services and regulators to consider as SMR and AMR deployment is progressed.",
            "\"There are many questions to be answered concerning the radioactive waste and spent fuel management aspects of the design and operation of SMRs and AMRs,\" CoRWM says. \"This paper begins the process of raising them, with the caveat that our knowledge of the reactor designs and their fuel requirements is relatively immature compared with large GW reactors.\"",
            "CoRWM says there are various mechanisms by which these questions could be addressed in the process of obtaining approval for the new reactors. These are principally: the process of justification, which will be mandatory for all new reactor types; Generic Design Assessment which is optional and non-statutory; nuclear site licensing; and environmental permitting.",
            "\"The last two stages of control may in some cases come too late in the process to allow for effective optimisation of designs and the selection of materials that reduce waste,\" CoRWM says. \"It remains to be seen how effective these mechanisms will be and whether they will occur sufficiently early in the decision-making process to ensure that radioactive waste management is fully and responsibly addressed.\"",
            "CoRWM was established in 2003 as a non-statutory advisory committee and is classed as a non-departmental public body. Its purpose is to provide independent advice to the UK government, and the devolved administrations based on scrutiny of the available evidence on the long-term management of radioactive waste, arising from civil and, where relevant, defence nuclear programmes, including storage and disposal.",
            "The UK government has plans to expand nuclear energy capacity to 24 GW by 2050, with a fleet of SMRs a key part of that strategy. Last year, the government and the new GBN arms-length body set up to help deliver that extra capacity began the selection process for which SMR technology to use. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of the process.",

            "According to the report, Westinghouse \"is seeking to install four AP1000 units in Ontario\". The report uses Westinghouse's estimates of capital expenditures, operating expenditures and revenues associated with manufacturing, engineering, installing and operating such a project, as well as primary and secondary research conducted by PWC.",
            "Once operational, the units would create an additional CAD8.1 billion in GDP and support more than 12,000 jobs annually, the report found. As well as helping Canada achieve its emission reduction plans, the project would also open up new opportunities for Canadian suppliers: with Westinghouse planning to make local procurement a key part of its investment policy and with the majority of total capital expenditure on the project expected to be spent in Canada.",
            "Westinghouse has been expanding its engineering base in Canada in support of new nuclear projects, including the opening this year of a new engineering hub in Kitchener, Ontario, the report notes, and Canada is now the third largest engineering centre for the AP1000. An AP1000 project in Ontario will leverage and grow the existing supply chain, and the use of these Canadian suppliers to support the construction of AP1000s elsewhere could support an impact of CAD880 million for Canada for each AP1000 unit built around the world.",
            "\"Our globally-deployed AP1000 reactor fleet is a licensed and proven technology that provides exceptional availability and economics across the world,\" said Westinghouse Energy Systems President David Durham. \"This report highlights that our technology and company - with strategic investments, a growing employee base and Canadian ownership - is well suited to meet Canada’s energy needs for generations to come.\"",

            "podcast, which you can also listen to via the embedded player below or",
            "On the general world situation and nuclear:",
            "\"I’m not sure I've seen as complicated a geopolitical situation as there is now around the world ... we were feeling tailwinds for nuclear even a couple years ago with the race to decarbonise and electrify and the race to net-zero. But then since February this year, with the Russians moving into Ukraine, the whole issue of energy security has really come to the fore, especially in Europe, but around the world.",
            "\"As far as Cameco goes, we went through a very difficult period I would say post-Fukushima, 10 years where there was too much uranium, too much nuclear fuel around. Things were looking not as good for nuclear, but they've really picked up now and and I could probably name you 20 countries that in the past 12 months have done a complete U-turn on nuclear and are now looking at expanding their fleets or bringing on reactors or SMRs perhaps. So it's a real positive story for nuclear and we have a big role to play in the energy security and clean air segments going forward.\"",
            "\"I think we've been very clear with our strategy for almost a decade now. It's a strategy of discipline that we will not produce uranium just to spray it into the spot market, because we saw how that worked. It doesn't work - it doesn't work for anyone. We lost some of our competitors over it, who were producing into a spot market that fell as low as USD17 per pound in 2017. We said we're only going to produce into the contracts we have and so that meant, for us, taking some really tough medicine. Back in 2016, we shut down our Rabbit Lake mine. We shut down Wyoming, Nebraska and then in 2017 we shut down the world’s largest high-grade mine and mill McArthur River/Key Lake because the world didn't need the uranium and no one else seemed to be stepping up, so we did that. We left over 100 million pounds in the ground at USD17 ... We maintained our supply discipline and today we have a better market. It's better, good enough that we can bring our big McArthur River/Key Lake production centre back into production at reduced levels that will match our sales, and so we'll continue with that as our sales grow, we'll bring on more production, but we will remain very, very disciplined from a production and a marketing point of view ... You'll see some production out of McArthur and Key Lake later this quarter. In the fourth quarter.”",
            "On the Cameco-Westinghouse deal",
            "\"We think the timing is really good. As I said, we've seen some real strong tailwinds coming for nuclear. We could see nuclear coming back as a tool in the toolkit for energy security around the world and so first we looked after our own operations. We made sure we were ready to go and we're restarting, as I say, McArthur River/Key Lake. Cigar Lake’s running well. Our Kazakh operations are running well. Our fuel services conversion in Ontario is really doing well, so we started looking for other things in our area. We're not straying outside of nuclear. Westinghouse was out there and we started looking at it with Brookfield, who was the owner and just a different entity of Brookfield - their Clean Energy Transition Fund - wanted to get involved and we said, 'well, that's brilliant'. Seeing nuclear as clean energy, them buying in, staying in, and then us coming along as a strategic partner and it just made perfect sense. So it took us about six months of due diligence and negotiations. And we think we found the right timing, the right partner and the right project. So we're super excited about the future of Westinghouse.”",
            "The news that Westinghouse was a successful bidder in Poland for its nuclear programme \"is just icing on the cake for us\".",
            "So what part of the Westinghouse deal is most exciting for Cameco?",
            "\"I'd say all of it is pretty exciting for us. Obviously the fuel business - our fuel businesses are very complementary. We provide fuel, we have the uranium conversion and then we actually provide the fuel for the CANDU reactor fleet here in Canada - Bruce Power, OPG, NB Power. Westinghouse takes over where we don't go. They’re in the light water reactor world and provide fuel there and then of course all the servicing and engineering and outages that they can work on. So that's all exciting stuff, that's their core business really and it's a very durable business. There is some excitement too with some of these new products that they're offering. Obviously the AP1000s that they're out selling. I think for Westinghouse, the e-Vinci,  a smaller unit ... I know here in Saskatchewan the government has been talking about perhaps buying and building one of the e-Vincis ... as Cameco we're looking at fuel for SMRs and whether we can play in that field, the HALEU field. We have the GLE global laser enrichment play in the US that we're moving along and moving along faster than we have because of the need for enrichment and so just a lot of areas for us to focus on now. We think there's a lot of room for growth in the nuclear business across the board, and Cameco wants to be there for that.\"",
            "What has been the impact of the war in Ukraine?",
            "\"Let me start with the impact on our countries, and here in Saskatchewan where our head office is located, I think 15 or 20% of our population here are of Ukrainian heritage, and so it's a really sad state of affairs. And our hearts go out to the people in Ukraine, including our customers at Energoatom. Petro Kotin, President and CEO of Energoatom, is a good friend of mine. We had dinner with him just before the end of last year at a big conference in Paris and then, this happened, so our hearts go out on that side first of all. What has it done for the nuclear industry? It has certainly caused a bit of a bifurcation now in the nuclear industry. Meaning there's those countries and companies that will continue to work with Russia - there are some - but there are a lot that won't anymore, and I think of all the Eastern European countries that have VVER technology in their countries and have relied heavily on the Russians for fuel and servicing and engineering and the things we talked about who are now looking for alternatives, and so we think Westinghouse will have a good opportunity in that market to pick up some business. And then Cameco - I was over there in the spring in the Czech Republic and meeting with some of those countries and so we think some of those will start looking West for alternative fuel supply and we'll be there to provide that, so it's really had a huge impact on the global nuclear industry and on Cameco’s business.\"",
            "What about the global situation for Cameco?",
            "\"We have customers in China and India - two countries that continue to grow, with China on a very fast path of growth and India, the same thing. And you see things changing - South Korea, a complete change - they were looking at phasing out some of their nuclear, now they've included it in their green taxonomy and plan to increase their nuclear presence. I mean, you can go to the UK, you can go to France and you can go to Japan and you can just see the momentum that nuclear is getting both from a clean energy perspective but from an energy security perspective as well. So we think there's great room for growth. I think the IEA came out last week and said if we have about 400 gigawatts today of nuclear, we need to double that. Double that in the next 20-25 years - and so for us that's not a long period of time. We need to get moving and get moving now and we're seeing it with Poland making their announcement, in the US - we're spending lots of time in the US where the Biden administration is very, very positive on nuclear with the Inflation Reduction Act, which has lots of support for nuclear. Here in Canada, our own government, the Ontario government and OPG building the first SMR are well on their way in Canada, the GE Hitachi model and so lots of excitement. Lots of things to do and lots of opportunities around the world.\"",
            "On technological developments in the nuclear energy sector",
            "\"Especially on the small modular reactor front I would say I think that the Canadian regulator has in front of them probably 11 or 12 different models of SMR right now, all competing to be the first out of the gate to get permitted, licenced and start construction and find a home and we need that because those first-of-a-kinds won't be easy. They never are. We've seen it in the larger reactor world and now in the SMR world we need to start building them - the Nth one will be super economic and then probably faster to build. The first one will be tough, and then we need to get the fuel ready for those. And you know, there's your question on Russia and Ukraine. I think we were all relying on many models, relying on the Russians for the HALEU fuel for the first SMRs. Now that door has been slammed shut. And so we're all looking around, scrambling maybe, but looking around for alternative ways we can get HALEU to fire up those first SMRs. So that's going on, but lots of great things going on even with the large fleet - such as accident tolerant fuel and passive safety systems. There's lots going on in nuclear and it's very exciting and very positive.\"",
            "How does the current positive outlook compare with previous optimistic eras?",
            "\"We've seen ebbs and flows before. I remember the period from about 2000 to March 2011. I mean there were too many new reactors to keep track of them. So many uranium companies. I think there were 400 uranium companies around. We got into a real exuberant period of time, probably over-the-top exuberance on nuclear. Everybody was building all the time and then we had Fukushima, so we need to be careful about that because after that we went into a 10 year period that wasn't so positive. But I think we're back again. The world is taking another look at nuclear and saying 'yes we can do it, we can do it safely and and cover for these large energy needs'. I mean, if we're turning to electricity for electric cars and electric everything, we're going to need massive amounts of electricity. And we're good at nuclear, we're very good. We've got a great track record over probably 60 years now and new technologies coming out. And so I'm very optimistic about this period. We need to do it right. We need to get financing for new build. We need to build them as much on time and on budget as we can. We've suffered from that blight a bit in the past, but if we do it right and we can do it right because we've done it in the past, the first one is difficult, but then after that you saw it in Sweden in the 1970s, you saw it in France, you saw it in the US, Canada. We can do it and so now is our opportunity, so we should take advantage of that.\"",
            "Does Brookfields Renewables’ involvement in Westinghouse deal show taxonomy’s importance?",
            "\"I think countries around the world are really recognising the clean energy benefits of nuclear power now and really grabbing on to it - I think there's 70 countries who have now made a net-zero commitment and you know, I think 80% of the energy in the world is fossil fuel fired so we need the path to get there. So you can't throw anything out of the toolbox and I think a lot of countries, as I mentioned earlier, are looking around and saying, what do we have - wind, yes, solar yes. Intermittent and right now they are five or six or maybe 10% of the world production of electricity. We need massive amounts more, and they're looking at nuclear again and saying ‘yeah, we need to keep that as an option’. And so it's very positive for countries looking to hit their net-zero commitments. We're seeing it. We'll see it at COP27 meetings where nuclear is at the table. I can tell you a few COPS ago, we weren't at the table and now we're front and centre at the table of countries looking to build nuclear. So I think nuclear is going to play a huge role in the climate change race to net-zero and decarbonisation electrification. And we as an industry must be ready.\"",
            "On new forms of investors in the nuclear industry",
            "\"We saw it here in Canada last week where the Canada Infrastructure Bank, which has traditionally not gone anywhere near nuclear, committed just under a CAD1 billion to the first SMR - OPG’s SMR. That's a big move. Our Minister of Natural Resources came out with very strong statements last week at the IAEA ministerial, as did many other countries on nuclear. You're seeing taxonomies change that are including nuclear in the clean energy discussion ... it's a complete change of lexicon, a change of thinking, and very positive for industry and now, as I say, we need to deliver.\"",
            "So what are the big challenges to fulfilling the potential?",
            "\"I think we have the technologies, now we've got to start building again. I think on the SMR front we need to get some of those built and up and running so that we can build the Nth one, not the first one. The order books are out there now. I think everyone’s going to be watching very closely in Canada as OPG and GE Hitachi build that first unit. The ground is broken so they're off to the races on that one. And I know in the US there's numerous other ones, we need to get those going. On the big units that are being built - the Chinese are very good at it, the Russians are very good and have a big order book. We in the West now need to show that we're back in the game and that we can take our share of the market. I think the announcement with Poland and Westinghouse was a huge announcement, it's going to be a big project. And I think there are more to come. And so we need to show the world that we can deliver our projects on time, on budget, that nuclear is going to be a critical part of the clean energy infrastructure going forward, and we on the fuel side have to be there to back it up with the fuel to run these things. And that’s not for a year or five years or even 10 years - for 50 years. When you're building a reactor today, you're worried about uranium in 2060 and 2080 and so that's what we're thinking about now. It's not just the next few years, it's decades.”",

            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

        "text": [
            "The Spring Budget 2024 has backed plans for nuclear energy progress and confirmed funding for decarbonisation investments through the Green Industries Growth Accelerator (Giga).",
            "A new £160M deal with Hitachi to acquire two sites, the former Wylfa nuclear site in north Wales and the Oldbury site in south Gloucestershire, was announced to develop nuclear for the UK’s energy security.",
            "The £20bn gigawatt-scale development at Wyfla on the coastline of Anglesey by Hitachi was suspended in January 2019 due to rising costs and a failure to reach a financial agreement with the UK government.",
            "Hunt said: “Ynys Môn has a vital role in delivering our nuclear ambitions. No-one should take more credit for today’s announcement than my tireless, tenacious and turbo-charged honourable friend for Ynys Môn.”",
            "The chancellor was referring to Ynys Môn MP Virginia Crosbie who has made continuous calls to bring new nuclear to Wylfa since she was elected in 2019.",
            "Secretary of state for Wales David TC Davies said: “The acquisition of Wylfa as a site for new nuclear development is fantastic news for Anglesey and the wider Welsh economy.",
            "“It’s the next step on our path to an energy secure and net zero future, while also laying the foundations for a huge economic boost.”",
            "Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb said: “I welcome the Chancellor’s announcement that a deal has now been reached with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site.",
            "\"The Welsh Affairs Committee held an inquiry into Nuclear energy in Wales last year and the evidence to the committee was clear: Wylfa is one of the best sites for nuclear development. With UK government ownership of the site, I hope that efforts can progress to allow the development of the Wylfa Newydd site to host the next nuclear power station in the UK after Sizewell C.”",
            "Nuclear Industry Association chief executive Tom Greatrex said: “This is a pivotal moment for the future of nuclear in the UK and should mark the beginning of new projects at these sites.",
            "“Wylfa is one of the very best sites for new nuclear anywhere in Europe and there is great promise for a series of SMRs at Oldbury. The success of ramping up nuclear capacity for energy security and net zero rests a great deal on whether we develop at these sites and others.",
            "“New nuclear capacity at Wylfa would transform the North Wales economy with fresh investment, thousands of good jobs, as well as providing clean, reliable and sovereign power lasting well into the next century.\"",
            "The chancellor further announced the continuation of the development of small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear technology in the UK.",
            "Six firms were shortlisted for government support to deliver a new wave of nuclear reactors in October last year.",
            "Rolls Royce SMR, Holtec Britain and GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International were among those announced to progress to the next stage of Great British Nuclear's small modular reactor (SMR) competition, which was brought forward in Hunt’s 2023 Spring Budget statement.",
            "EDF, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK will also have the chance to bid for government contracts through the initiative.",
            "Greatrex continued: “I also welcome the beginning of the next phase of the SMR selection process, and I hope the work carried out over the coming months continues to be swift and thorough so that we don’t fall behind other countries in delivering our nuclear programme.",
            "“There needs to be a huge ramp up of new nuclear, both SMRs and large-scale stations, and we must keep up this momentum.”",
            "Green Industries Growth Accelerator ",
            "Also confirmed was £120M extra funding for the Green Industries Growth Accelerator (Giga) which was initially announced yesterday.",
            "Giga is an investment programme for the expansion of low carbon manufacturing supply chains in the UK.",
            "The government has also confirmed the total fund, which has now increased to nearly £1.1bn, will be split between the clean energy sectors, with £390M earmarked to expand UK-based supply chains for electricity networks and offshore wind sectors, and around £390M for the carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen sectors.",
            "The remaining £300M was previously announced for UK production of the fuel required to power high-tech new nuclear reactors, known as High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU).",
            "Costain energy director Laura Hughes said: “The energy sector will be buoyed by news relating both to energy transition and power transmission.  Moving forward with planning and grid connection reforms is critical to the timely delivery of the required electricity network.  A consultation around a new accelerated planning service and the confirmed establishment of the new National Energy System Operator this year are key elements that will maintain momentum in the delivery of energy infrastructure.",
            "“Confirmation of further investment into supply chains for carbon capture utilisation and storage and hydrogen is also positive news. This is a measure that could help generate consistency of demand, provide investors with more assurance, and incentivise the industry to develop the engineering skills needed for the UK to remain competitive on the global stage. Improvements and upgrades to the energy infrastructure ecosystem will help with job creation and regional economic growth, fuelling a virtuous circle that goes beyond energy security.",
            "“Carbon capture and hydrogen will play a crucial role in achieving UK’s 2050 net zero target, but long-term, strategic thinking around creating interconnected infrastructure is needed to get molecules into pipelines.”"

        "text": [
            "US nuclear energy venture Westinghouse Electric Company has joined forces with Cumbria based venture Community Nuclear Power (CNP) to deploy four Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in North Teesside.",
            "The agreement announced 8 February “marks a first step in the private delivery of advanced, proven SMR technology to the UK,” Westinghouse said in a statement. “It is a significant step in making this new energy sector a reality with commercial operation expected by the early 2030s.”",
            "The alliance with CNP, a Cockermouth-based consultancy, will see  four Westinghouse AP300 SMRs in North Teesside where economic growth is driving demand for carbon-free, reliable electricity. CNP is working with strategic partners including Jacobs and financial consultancy Interpath Advisory to develop a site for the project by 2027. The project is being privately funded.",
            "The four SMRs will follow Westinghouse’s AP300 model, released last May.  The AP300 SMR, 300MWe (990MWth), is based on \"proven\" technology used in the larger Generation III+ reactor already in operation globally, the  AP1000. Westinghouse says the AP1000 reactor “represents the most advanced technology available today, able to supply over 1 GW of electricity to centralised power grids. It features simplified plant design, with key features including fewer safety-related valves, less safety-related piping, less control cable, fewer pumps and less seismic building volume.",
            "The AP300 SMR was selected by Great British Nuclear (GBN) last October for the next phase of its competitive technology selection process, in line with the government’s plans to deliver a pipeline of nuclear energy projects beyond Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C. North Teesside plans to deploy the SMRs also come amid the government’s ‘Alternative Routes to Market for New Nuclear Projects’ consultation which runs until 4 April and the publication of the government Civil Nuclear Roadmap in January, which sets out its “vision for a dynamic civil nuclear sector, supporting the ambition to achieve net zero by 2050.”",
            "For scale: Westinghouse AP300 small modular reactor in a stadium",
            "On the Alternative Routes to Market for New Nuclear Projects’ consultation, minister for nuclear and renewables Andrew Bowie said:",
            "“The UK’s energy market has reached a critical juncture. We need a stronger, more reliable supply to meet increasing demand – one which doesn’t leave us dependent on foreign energy imports. But we also know how important it is to reduce carbon emissions and maintain our status as a world leader in the fight against climate change.",
            "“Nuclear power, as one of the most reliable, secure, low-carbon sources of home-produced energy, is a solution to both challenges. And that is why this government is making nuclear a central pillar of our future energy mix, with ambitions to deliver up to 24GW of capacity by 2050 – enough to meet around a quarter of the country’s projected demand.”",
            "On the North Teesside development, CNP CEO Paul Foster said: “This project brings together Westinghouse’s proven technology and mature supply chain with our depth of expertise in nuclear programme delivery, in a region that is transforming its industrial landscape. We are delighted to be working with Westinghouse in support of private deployment in North Teesside”.",
            "Westinghouse president, energy systems David Durham said: “We want to thank Community Nuclear Power for this tremendous opportunity to deliver our advanced, proven AP300 SMR technology to the UK market.",
            "“Our AP300 SMR is ideally suited not just to support grid generation, but also for industrial sites for generating clean and secure energy and the ability to produce hydrogen, e-fuels, desalination and district heating.”",
            "Westinghouse said that: “Unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks, Westinghouse’s AP300 SMR utilises the AP1000 engineering, components, and supply chain, enabling streamlined licensing and leveraging available technical skills. Together, these factors provide confidence that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "“The advantageous economics of the AP300 SMR are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development.”",
            "SMR deployment is seen as desirable as it is more flexible than that of legacy reactors. Large nuclear power plants in the US have an 800km2 emergency planning zone (approximately the size of San Diego) and SMR developers argue that their safety zones will be equal to that of the site boundaries.",
            "SMRs also enable off-grid deployments for uses such as on-site power generation for industry and manufacturing."

            "GE Hitachi was one of six firms shortlisted late last year for government support to deliver a new wave of nuclear reactors, with the shortlist also including Rolls Royce SMR, Holtec Britain, EDF, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK.",
            "SMR designs from Rolls Royce SMR and Holtec Britain, with the aid of Mott MacDonald, are currently undergoing GDA.",
            "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero requested that the GDA takes place following the department’s readiness review of GE Hitachi’s application which concluded that the design is ready to enter the GDA process which can take approximately four years.",
            "The government said that the GDA will “look to actively explore opportunities to maximise the value of international regulatory collaboration and identify efficiencies in processes.”",
            "GDA is a voluntary, non-mandatory process which can provide early condifence that a proposed reactor design if capable of being constructed, operated and decommissioned in accordance with the standards of safety, security and environmental protection which are required in Great Britain.",
            "A full GDA is a three step process but vendors can choose to complete just the first two steps if they wish.",
            "The first step is about project mobilisation and agreeing the scope.",
            "The second consists of a fundamental review of safety, security and safeguards by ONR and England and Wales’s respective environmental regulators.",
            "Vendors can choose to stop the GDA process at this stage, or carry on to the third step, which involves a detailed assessment of their submissions.",
            "If the three step GDA is completed, a design acceptance confirmation (DAC) can be issued. This also assumed that the ONR has concluded that the design is “capable of being safely and securely built and operated, subject to future site-specific assessment and licensing.”",
            "A GDA is not a substitute for the nuclear site licensing process but it can help make a significant contribution to any future ONR assessment of the safety case for a new reactor.",
            "The ONR said “Should an organisation seek to construct and operate a reactor in Britain that has not been subject to a three-step GDA, the detailed design assessment would need to be carried out through ONR’s statutory regulatory processes, established through the nuclear site licence, before a permission could be granted to start nuclear safety-related construction.”"

        "text": [
            "The UK government last week launched the new arms-length body Great British Nuclear (GBN) to “drive the rapid expansion of new nuclear power plants in the UK at an unprecedented scale and pace”. NCE takes a closer look at the nuclear projects that will be supported by GBN.",
            "The launch of GBN saw the opening of registration for companies to participate in a competition to secure funding support to develop their products. This is mainly focused around developing small modular reactors (SMRs) in the UK. As the government explains: “Unlike conventional reactors that are built on site, SMRs are smaller, can be made in factories and could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster, and less expensive.”",
            "Rolls-Royce is the most advanced in developing SMRs as the leader of the UK SMR consortium, which features Atkins, Bam Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O’Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, TWI and Assystem.",
            "Its design for a 470MW SMR passed the first assessment hurdle in April this year. It has now moved on to Step 2 of the generic design assessment process, which is expected to take 16 months.",
            "Rolls-Royce is acting quickly though, having released a shortlist of three potential locations for its heavy pressure vessels factory, which will produce components for a fleet of SMRs. It has also met with stakeholders at potential sites for its first SMR in Oldbury and Berkeley. It is aiming to power up the first SMR in 2029 or early 2030s.",
            "Its pop-up factories for building SMRs could see them constructed in only 500 days.",
            "Meanwhile, another UK-based nuclear start up called Newcleo is working on its own SMR design that would use nuclear waste. It is currently seeking to raise up to £1bn to fund its delivery roadmap for its SMR, known as the Mini 30MWe LFR that will deployed in France. This will then be followed by the 200Mwe commercial unit to be deployed in the UK two years later.",
            "Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s micro modular reactor",
            "GBN has granted £22.5M to Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) for the development of its micro modular reactor (MMR), a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) suited to UK industrial demands including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel production.",
            "USNC has match-funded the £22.5M to enable the second phase of work toward building a UK demonstrator. It has appointed Jacobs to support the design and development of the MMR.",
            "Unlike other nuclear reactors, the MMR uses no water and has no need for an electrical grid or infrastructure support. It is usable in extreme climates.",
            "The MMR’s fully ceramic micro-encapsulated fuel provides inherent reactor safety. Industry standard TRISO particles, which contain the radioactive byproducts of fission within layered ceramic coatings, are encased within a fully dense silicon carbide matrix. This combination provides an extremely rugged and stable fuel with extraordinary high temperature stability.",
            "The Seattle-based company has plans to deploy its MMRs in Poland, Finland, Canada and the USA. It has demonstration projects underway at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories and at the University of Illinios.",
            "The demonstration units are scheduled for first nuclear power in 2026.",
            "National Nuclear Laboratory’s next generation high temperature reactor",
            "GBN has committed £15M to the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) in Warrington. It is working with the Japan Atomic Energy Authority to accelerate the development of a high temperature reactor, which has already been successful in Japan.",
            "The next generation high temperature gas cooled reactors have now reached design phase. This reactor delivers much higher outlet temperatures than existing technology, allowing the heat to be used directly to decarbonise industrial processes. It will enable the large-scale production of hydrogen via electrochemical or thermochemical processes.",
            "National Nuclear Laboratory’s sovereign coated particle fuel capability",
            "High-temperature reactors use coated particle fuel and GBN has committed £16M to the NNL in Preston to continue developing its sovereign coated particle fuel capability, a critical enabler for the UK’s future energy security.",
            "The NNL recently celebrated the casting of active fuel kernels at scale. These kernels form the tiny particles of uranium, that are subsequently coated in four layers of ceramic and carbon creating coated particle fuel. Often referred to as ‘the most robust nuclear fuel’, each coated particle is roughly the size of a poppy seed – with the uranium kernel housed inside its own miniature container vessel.",
            "GBN’s Nuclear Fuel Fund is forking out £22.3M to enable eight projects to develop new fuel production and manufacturing capabilities in the UK.",
            "The biggest sum has gone to Springfields Fuels in Preston, part of the Westinghouse Group, which has received £10.5M. Nuclear fuel fabrication services have taken place at the site since the mid-1940s and today Springfield Fuels designs, manufactures and delivers fuel for nuclear plants. This includes the manufacture of oxide fuels for Advanced Gas-cooled and Light Water Reactors, as well as intermediate fuel products, such as powders, granules and pellets.",
            "A £9.56M sum has been committed to Urenco UK in Chester, a specialist in the production of advanced fuels for nuclear reactors of tomorrow. The funds will be used for the concept design of plants and processes supporting the further development of advanced fuels. It will also look at enriching uranium to higher levels to allow for reactors to run for longer between refuelling outages.",
            "MoltexFLEX, a UK molten salt reactor (MSR) developer, received £1.3M. MSRs are a type of AMR that use separate molten salts as a coolant and fuel, leading to intrinsic safety compared with conventional fuels. The funds from the Nuclear Fuel Fund will be used to develop detailed technical plans for commercial-scale delivery of its low-enriched uranium fuel salt. MoltexFLEX has developed significant proprietary data on fuel design and is expecting to partner with a major fuel supplier to establish a pathway to commercial production.",
            "Nuclear Transport Solutions (NTS) is the recipient of over £1M for the development of a new transport package that will support a new generation of nuclear reactors. The fuel – High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) – is more energy dense and requires less fuel than current nuclear power production. HALEU requires innovative transportation solutions to ensure it can be moved safely and securely to new reactor. NTS’ new package will be versatile to allow the transport of HALEU in multiple forms, such as powder or fuel elements.",
            "Advanced Nuclear Business Development",
            "As part of the funding package announced in conjunction with the launch of GBN, the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) committed up to £77.1M of funding for companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK. This will help and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulation and maximise the chance of SMRs and AMRs being built in the next Parliament.",
            "Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C",
            "While no new funds were specifically designated to the development of the UK’s in-progress large-scale nuclear power plants, the government’s announcement of GBN mentioned that it “remains committed” to them.",
            "Last year the government committed £700M to the development of Sizewell C, a new 3,200MWe nuclear plant in Suffolk that is currently in the design phase. Sizewell C managing director Julia Pyke has said that the launch of GBN is “another big vote of confidence in Sizewell C”.",
            "Hinkley Point C is an under-construction 3,200MWe nuclear plant in Somerset. Its first nuclear reactor arrived on site in February and it is nearing the completion of its undersea work. However, it has faced numerous construction setbacks and is now not expected to power up until the mid 2030s."

            "Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit head of energy Jess Ralston said:",
            "“A number of experts, including the Climate Change Committee, see a role for nuclear in removing gas from our power system, but with SMRs yet to be deployed and larger plants like Hinkley over-budget and delayed, it’s difficult to predict exactly what the costs and timescales might be for future endeavours. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the high upfront costs of nuclear could leave us with a £170bn bill.",
            "“Despite slight cost increases given current inflation levels, British renewables will remain much cheaper than both gas and nuclear. There are questions over whether Government has taken its eye off the ball for the current Contracts for Difference auction round for wind farms, imposing too tight restrictions and so limiting the projects that might get built. Where Government places its focus is important for green investment from businesses, and clearly rapidly building out renewables is the best deal for the UK tax or billpayer.”",
            "Atkins nuclear and power managing director Chris Conboy said: ",
            "“Today’s GB Nuclear launch is an important milestone towards establishing the critical role that nuclear will have in the UK’s net zero future. The support for small modular reactor projects should accelerate the development of technologies that have the potential to provide greater energy resilience and deliver clean, affordable power. This positive support for new technologies and investment in domestic fuel manufacture capability sits alongside a welcome continued commitment to largescale nuclear through the progress already made at Hinkley Point C and a future plant at Sizewell C. The Government’s ambition to deliver a quarter of the country’s electricity from nuclear will be achieved through the safe, efficient, cost-effective and timely delivery of new build projects, and we look forward to playing a role in engineering a nuclear-fuelled future for the UK.”",
            "BDB Pitmans partner and parliamentary agent Mustafa Latif-Aramesh said:",
            "“Today is a significant day for nuclear in the UK. The release of funding, which had been delayed, will mean that the Government is finally putting money where its mouth is for Small and Advanced Nuclear Reactors. That technology is urgently required both for energy resilience and in order to allow the UK to meet its decarbonisation targets.",
            "“The announcement should be accompanied by a renewed focus on publishing details on siting arrangements, and confirmation on Great British Nuclear’s remit in being a partner at the development phase. Government should throw resources at updating the National Policy Statement for Nuclear in advance of their 2025 target, and confirming that nuclear projects outside of existing or decommissioned nuclear sites can progress so that the private sector can deliver clean energy in tandem with GBN’s competition processes.”",
            "Turner & Townsend director and head of UK natural resources Alan Sinclair commented:",
            "“The success of Great British Nuclear will rely on three major components: attracting investment, spurring innovation and building skills.  Lack of certainty has dogged the sector for over a decade and both investors and the supply chain are looking for a clear break from the past.  Get it right and the UK has the potential to tackle emissions and energy independence, while also establishing the foundations for a world-class industry with expertise that can be exported abroad.",
            "“Providing 24Gw of generation by 2050 is a gargantuan task and clarity over financing is the first priority.  The £20bn committed directly from Government for SMRs can kick-start the private investment that will be needed and galvanise not just operators, but also the supply chain required to build and manage these new sites.  SMRs bring a greater opportunity for off-site design and construction, and a reduced reliance on supporting infrastructure on a massive scale.  However, shaping the supply chain to support these changes in the UK’s approach will take time and careful capacity planning.",
            "“People will be crucial to success.  The requirements across defence and energy taken together amount to upwards of 250,000 roles.  That is a major undertaking in its own right and GBN will need to draw on the UK’s existing pools of talent from the energy and infrastructure sector if it is to succeed.  Above all, we need to be keenly aware that the UK is competing in a global market for talent.",
            "“Expertise in new methods of generation also needs to be matched by equivalent investment across the nuclear lifecycle - for decommissioning and waste storage - so that the industry remains self-sustaining long-term.”",
            "Balfour Beatty Group chief executive Leo Quinn said:",
            "“Great British Nuclear represents a gear change in how we power the country’s homes and businesses.",
            "“Nuclear energy is a clear and proven route to secure clean, homegrown energy – removing the reliance on costly imports. The construction and infrastructure industry continues to deliver on Hinkley Point C and is ready to get started on Sizewell C. In doing so, we can reduce energy bills, lower carbon emissions, create thousands of jobs – including apprenticeships – and cement Britain’s position as a leader in clean energy.”",

        "text": [
            "The Welsh Affairs Committee has asked for clarity on a proposed nuclear project in Anglesey, Wales in the upcoming spring budget which is due to be announced on 15 March.",
            "Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station was originally earmarked for development by the government in 2010 but was stalled after Horizon Nuclear Power, original owners of the project, officially withdrew its planning application for the £20bn power station at Wylfa in January 2021 after funding challenges.",
            "In a letter to the prime minister Rishi Sunak ahead of the spring budget, seen by NCE, Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb has called for the next nuclear power station, after Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C, to be built at Wylfa.",
            "He further argues the government has made little progress on its ambitions laid out in the British Energy Security Strategy, released in April 2022.",
            "Crabb said: “The UK Government’s British Energy Security Strategy sent positive demand signals to the nuclear energy sector. But since its publication in April last year, we have heard very little as to how the target to generate 24GW of nuclear energy by 2050 will be accomplished.\"",
            "In his letter, Crabb adds claims that government advisor on establishing Great British Nuclear, which was a key part of the Energy Strategy on nuclear, Simon Bowen, told his committee that “it will be disastrous if we waited another two years” because the “whole of the industry will lose faith” and that “we’ve got to have the courage to take an inter-generational view […] for low carbon and net zero”.",
            "Crabb added: “Nuclear energy could hold the answer to reliable baseload as we transition away from oil and gas. With mounting household bills and the spiralling costs of fossil fuels, there is a unique opportunity to galvanise the low-carbon energy sectors. Instead, the nuclear energy sector has been waiting to know the ‘when and where’ for nuclear power stations in the UK.\"",
            "In the letter, Crabb also said: \"The [Energy] Strategy named Wylfa as a potential site for a new nuclear project. Since then, we have heard of growing concerns of a loss of momentum in delivery of the government’s Strategy and consequently, further uncertainty over the future of the Wylfa site.",
            "\"We have heard from a wide range of industry representatives that Wylfa is considered the best site in the UK for new nuclear development. Indeed, it is difficult to see how government can deliver its nuclear ambitions without taking forward a project at Wylfa. There is a strong view within the committee that Wylfa should be the next large scale site in line after Sizewell C so that North Wales can benefit from the economic impacts of a large-scale infrastructure project, which will bring highly skilled and well-paid long term job opportunities to a rural area of the UK.",
            "\"We have heard strong calls from the finance and skills sectors as well as from technology developers for a programme for nuclear which sets out which technology  - large scale or small modular reactors -  the government wants to be built, where and when.",
            "\"The majority of members of the committee are of the view that the Great British Nuclear arms-length body should be launched as soon as possible, with a mandate to deliver such a programme, in order to provide much needed clarity to the whole industry.\"",
            "Although the original plans by Horizon Nuclear Power, which is a subsidiary of Hitachi, have been withdrawn, a consortium including engineering firm Bechtel and reactor maker Westinghouse have been in talks with government over an alternative proposal since 2020. The latest plans for Wylfa involve building two AP1000 reactors, which is a different reactor design to the EPR being used at Hinkley Point C, which is also planned for Sizewell C.",
            "In May 2022, the consortium released cost estimates which could see the power plant built for between £14bn and £17bn."

            "The funding, which totals £102M, includes £77M to bolster nuclear fuel production and support the development of advanced nuclear reactors and £25M for technologies that can produce hydrogen from sustainable biomass and waste, while removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.",
            "Funding worth up to £60M will kick start the next phase of research into the new cutting-edge high temperature gas reactor (HTGR), a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR), which could be up and running by the early 2030s. The funding, from the Advanced Modular Reactor R&D programme, aims to get a demonstration project of the engineering design up and running by the end of the decade.",
            "HTGRs are typically smaller than conventional nuclear power stations, more flexible, and could be built at a fraction of a cost. It is hoped that as well as safely creating electricity to power homes, HTGRs will bolster the UK’s energy sovereignty and security, by reducing reliance on expensive fossil fuels, as well as generate by-products such as low-carbon hydrogen.  By generating temperatures of up to 950 degrees, HTGRs provide a source of clean, high temperature heat that could help decarbonise industrial processes in the UK.",
            "Today’s funding for HTGR innovation is supported with a further £4M funding for the AMR Knowledge Capture Project, as a complementary project to the AMR Research, Development and Demonstration programme.  The project seeks to facilitate knowledge capture and sharing to reduce the time, risk, and cost of the programme delivery.",
            "Also announced is up to £13M for nuclear fuel fabricators Westinghouse in Preston, which has strategic importance to producing fuel for the current UK advanced gas cooled reactor fleet. The funding will mean the UK has the option of being less reliant on imports from abroad and helps the company develop the capability convert both reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium to make new fuel. This is a significant investment at the Westinghouse Springfields site in Lancashire safeguarding hundreds of highly skilled jobs in the northwest.",
            "As well as bolstering UK energy security, ministers hope it will also deliver export opportunities for the sector and position the UK as a key international supplier of nuclear fuel and fuel cycle services.",
            "The news comes after ministers confirmed the first state backing of a nuclear project in over 30 years, with a £700M stake in Sizewell C in Suffolk. The power station will produce enough electricity to power the equivalent of 6M homes for over 50 years. Yesterday EDF Energy appointed a design team made up of Egis, Jacobs UK, Setec TPI and Tractebel Engineering for the power plant.",
            "Energy and climate minister Graham Stuart said: \"This funding package will strengthen our energy security, by ensuring we have a safe and secure supply of domestic nuclear fuel services - while also creating more UK jobs and export opportunities.\"",
            "Meanwhile, accelerating the use of hydrogen will be key to the UK’s greener energy future, alongside the government’s work to deploy renewables and nuclear to strengthen the UK’s energy security.",
            "To support this, the government has committed £25M to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) - a unique \"negative emission\" technology that can permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Biomass absorbs CO2 during growth which is then captured and permanently stored during the hydrogen generation process.",
            "Hydrogen BECCS technologies will have a key role to play on the UK’s path to net zero emissions, providing hydrogen as a clean fuel for hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as transport and heavy industry. Today’s funding will go directly towards progressing BECCS projects from the design stage to demonstration, supporting the technology to eventually become integrated as part of our everyday energy system.",
            "Energy minister Lord Callanan said: \"With its potential to go one step further than net zero, and be carbon negative – removing greenhouse gas emissions from the atmosphere – this hydrogen technology will be crucial to achieving our climate goals.",

The design was accepted for UK Generic Design Assessment review in March 2022 and Rolls-Royce SMR expects to receive UK regulatory approval by mid-2024. A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium – which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O’Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI – expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.",
            "GE-Hitachi’s BWRX-300 SMR features an innovative and simplified configuration, resulting in less concrete and steel needed for construction. GE-Hitachi says it is a cost-competitive solution that can be deployed for electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating. “Using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in 24-36 months while achieving an approximate 90 percent volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW should also account for 50% less concrete per MW – a significant improvement in both affordability and advantageous size.”",

Its Kaleidos design is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) which will use TRISO fuel, a helium coolant, and a graphite moderator. All components will be fitted in a single shipping container to facilitate rapid deployment. It is designed to produce 1.2MWe or 1.9 MWt for heating or water desalination, as a potential replacement for diesel generators. Following testing that is scheduled to begin in 2026, Radiant targets commercial production units in 2028, after obtaining US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licences.",

The largest producers are Bruce Power and Ontario Power Generation (OPG) that operate CANDU type reactors in Canada. CANDU reactors are well suited for cobalt-60 production with the technology and processes established in the early 1970s with a history dating back to the 1950s.",

For cobalt-60 production, these stainless steel adjusters are replaced with adjusters containing bundles of metallic cobalt-59 slugs encapsulated into zirconium alloy capsules. The cobalt-59 adjusters are designed to replicate the neutron absorption characteristics of the stainless adjusters that they replace, so reactor operation is not impacted. While in the reactor core, the cobalt-59 atom absorbs one neutron to become cobalt-60 and over time the ratio of cobalt-60 to cobalt-59 increases. To achieve the required level of cobalt-60, the adjusters are activated over a period of 18-36 months.",

Approximately 80% of this cobalt-60 usage is for the sterilisation of medical devices. In the US alone, it is estimated that some 16 billion devices are sterilised annually using cobalt-60.",
            "The demand for sterilisation and, therefore, cobalt-60 is growing at rates not previously seen due to an increasing and ageing population, greater access to health care and the development of new devices that require sterilisation. Some sectors are experiencing double digit annual growth rates and in recent years, vaccine supply pressure concentrated the need for sterilisation and, in some cases, created a backlog.",
            "Although cobalt-60 supply continues to increase, in recent years this growth has been out-paced by growth in demand. This is of concern to the healthcare sector that relies on irradiation sterilisation to enable it to meet growing patient treatment needs. Whilst alternatives to cobalt-60 technology are available for sterilisation, these alternatives do not have the capacity to meet existing demand or the infrastructure to enable rapid growth to meet future demand.",
            "At a time of increasing sterilisation demand, there have been a few disruptions to cobalt-60 production. This includes the temporary shutdown for refurbishment of some existing cobalt-60 production reactors in Canada and Argentina, and periods of reduced supply from Russia. Reactor refurbishment is critical to extending the life of reactors by 25-30 years and but also creates opportunities to increase cobalt-60 production for the long term.",
            "Above: Co-60 is widely used in the sterilisation of medical instruments",
            "Reactor refurbishment and conversion for cobalt-60 production",
            "In the case of the ongoing Bruce Power Life Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project, the opportunity has been taken to add more cobalt-59 adjusters to increase cobalt-60 production above the existing levels. This investment will secure the operation of these reactors and cobalt-60 production until 2064.",
            "At the OPG Darlington refurbishment, the opportunity will also be taken to convert these four reactors to enable cobalt-60 production. This will add valuable cobalt-60 supply and builds on OPG’s experience of cobalt-60 production at Pickering.",
            "The Pickering reactors have been scheduled to cease commercial operation at the end of 2024, however, the Ontario Government recently confirmed its support of OPG’s plan to refurbish the Pickering B reactors that are also cobalt-60 producing units. This refurbishment is subject to approval by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) that is already considering a request from OPG to extend the operating licence of the Pickering B reactors until 2026. If approved, the reactors will continue operation until shut down to begin the refurbishment programme. Refurbishment would enable continued operation of these reactors for a further 30 years.",
            "The CANDU reactor at Embalse, Argentina, has also been refurbished recently to enable continued operation and cobalt-60 production for a further 30 years. Additionally, Russian cobalt-60 production has been expanded. While two of the cobalt-60 producing units at the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant have been shut down, five reactors at Kursk and Smolensk have been added. There is also a reported intension to increase cobalt-60 production at Indian PHWR reactors; and Nuclearelectrica Romania has announced a study of cobalt-60 production at its CANDU reactors at Cernavoda NPP.",
            "Currently, almost all of the world’s cobalt-60 is produced in CANDU Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs) and RBMK Light Water Graphite-moderated Reactors (LWGRs) of which there is a limited number. The greatest opportunity to significantly increase the availability of cobalt-60 is therefore to develop production in new reactor types. There are approximately 440 commercial reactors in operation of which more than 300 are Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs). This has made PWRs the reactor platform of focus for future cobalt-60 production.",
            "In February 2020, Nordion announced that it was partnering with Westinghouse to develop large-scale production of cobalt-60 in PWRs. Both Nordion and Westinghouse have since updated the irradiation market with the timeline of this important initiative and confirmation that progress has been made with technology development, licencing, manufacture of components and the recruitment of three utility companies that operate five reactors. Production of cobalt-60 in PWR’s would be highly scalable with the capacity to at least double existing worldwide production volumes from PWRs in the US alone.",
            "Other initiatives include the announcement in December 2021 that Framatome and Exelon Generation will cooperate to understand and develop solutions to produce cobalt-60 in PWRs operated by Exelon Generation (now Constellation).",
            "Securing the critical supply of cobalt-60",
            "The healthcare industry has relied on cobalt-60 since the 1960s when the demand for medical device sterilisation started to grow. The production of cobalt-60 in nuclear reactors remains critical to health care and will continue to be critical for the long term future. Although significant steps are underway to increase production, growing demand for healthcare means that new cobalt-60 supply will always be important.",
            "The road to engaging in cobalt-60 production is complex. There are a number of design and engineering considerations, safety assessments, the need to understand the impact on reactor efficiency and operations, and many other regulatory and operational considerations. However, there is also a wealth of experience and willing partners who understand the importance of increasing cobalt-60 production. In addition to the provision of clean energy, the production of cobalt-60 in support of health care remains a highly positive contribution by the nuclear industry to societal wellbeing.",

Rockfin is a manufacturer of auxiliary equipment for steam turbines and generators (STGs), and EthosEnergy Poland a provider of maintenance services.",
            "Toshiba ESS and TIL recently initiated another step to advance the project and establish a supply chain in Poland by closing collaborative arrangements with Rockfin and EthosEnergy. The next step will include detailed discussions between the four parties on the scope of collaboration.",
            "The Polish authorities intend to build six nuclear power units within 20 years. Starting in 2033, it is planned to start launching power units with a capacity of 1-1.6 GWe every two to three years to generate from 6-9 GWe. The aim is for the first unit to begin operation in 2033.",
            "In June 2022, Toshiba ESS and its US affiliate, Toshiba America Energy Systems Company agreed with Bechtel to collaborate on the supply of steam turbines and generators for the NPP. In November 2022, the Polish government selected Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology for construction at the Lubiatowo-Kopalino site in the Choczewo municipality in Pomerania. The construction is expected to cost about $20bn.",
            "An agreement setting a plan for the delivery of the plant was signed in May 2023 by Westinghouse, Bechtel and Polish utility Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ). Under a subsequent engineering services agreement with PEJ, Westinghouse and Bechtel will finalise a site-specific design for a plant featuring three AP1000 reactors. The contract also involves supporting the investment process in line with current legal regulations. The Ministry of Climate & Environment in July issued a decision-in-principle for PEJ to construct the plant.",
            "Commenting on the Polish project, Shinya Fujitsuka, Director and Vice President of Toshiba ESS, said, “We are delighted to announce the signing of an MoU with Rockfin and EthosEnergy, and in doing so creating a strong potential collaboration for Poland’s first nuclear project.

        "title": "IEEFA report critiques feasibility of small modular reactors",
        "text": [
            "A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has assessed the feasibility of deploying small modular nuclear reactors to meet increasing energy demands around the world. The report, “Small Modular Reactors: Still Too Expensive, Too Slow, and Too Risky” asks if continuing to pursue small NPPs is worthwhile in terms of meeting increasing global energy demands. demand for more energy around the globe.",
            "The 23-page report notes: “The rhetoric from small modular reactor (SMR) advocates is loud and persistent: This time will be different because the cost overruns and schedule delays that have plagued large reactor construction projects will not be repeated with the new designs,” says the report. “But the few SMRs that have been built (or have been started) paint a different picture – one that looks startlingly similar to the past. Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "On costs, the report looks at three operating SMRs worldwide—two in Russia [possibly just one – the Akademik Lomonosov, which has two reactors] and one in China, the demonstration High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) at the Shidaowan site in Shandong province. It also considers a fourth – the CAREM-25 SMR under construction in Argentina.",
            "It says costs for all four [three] have been significantly higher than originally planned. “The takeaway is that the projected costs significantly understated actual construction expenditures.” However, the report does not take into account that these are all first-of-a-kind (FOAK) designs and have become the basis of further plants. Russia is already building several SMRs (both floating and land based) in almost series production using upgraded reactors based on the Akademik Lomosonov experience, the costs of which will be greatly reduced. China’s HTR-PM has become the basis for a novel district heating scheme and a larger HTGR is now being developed based on this experience. The CAREM 25 has faced delays and cost overruns but is now expected to begin operation in 2027. Both Russia and Argentina expect their designs to be the basis for lucrative exports in the future.",
            "IEEFA says two other SMRs currently under construction in China and Russia are also years behind schedule. “Russia’s BREST-300 lead-cooled reactor is now scheduled for completion in 2026, even though announcements in the early 2010s had indicated it would be operational by 2018. Similarly, China’s ACP100, a 125MW pressurized water SMR that has been under development since the early 2010s, is now not scheduled to begin commercial operation until 2026.” These are also FOAK designs for which delays are par for the course and will ultimately offer opportunities for replication and exports.",
            "IEEFA notes that similar significant cost increases have occurred at proposed projects in the US, citing the cancellation of NuScale’s planned facility in Idaho in cooperation with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "The report notes: “NuScale’s problems are not unique. US SMR developers have consistently sought to shield their construction cost estimates, but information about two other prominent projects shows that the estimated costs for these projects also have skyrocketed. The cost increases for the X-Energy and GE-Hitachi SMR projects occurred well before either had secured licensing approval from NRC [National Regulatory Authority], let alone begun construction. IEEFA believes this should be a red flag for utilities, regulators and investors.",
            "IEEFA says the cost debate “inevitably includes Westinghouse, the developer of the two AP1000 reactors recently brought online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle nuclear facility”, which was more than $20bn over budget and took more than six years longer to complete than forecast. “Undaunted by that debacle, Westinghouse has now jumped into the SMR market, introducing a 300MW unit (the AP300) that it says it can build for $3,333 per kW- even though the final cost of the Vogtle reactors was more than $20,000 per kW in 2023-year dollars. Even if Westinghouse’s projected AP300 cost is just an overnight estimate that excludes escalation and financing costs, that is a spectacular projected cost reduction for a facility that is still not licensed and far from breaking ground for construction.”",
            "In terms of the projects being “too slow”, the report, referring to the same projects, notes that they all took longer to build than planned. Again, with respect to the Russian and Chinese plants, this was not a real consideration as it is expected for FOAK projects.",
            "However, for those still in the design stage, IEEFA may have a point. “Despite this real-world experience, Westinghouse, X-Energy and NuScale, among others, continue to claim they will be able to construct their SMRs in 36 to 48 months, perhaps quickly enough to have them online by 2030,” the report notes. “GE-Hitachi even claims it ultimately will be able to construct its 300MW facility in as little as 24 months. Admittedly, there is a not-zero chance this is possible, but it flies in the face of nuclear industry experience, both in terms of past SMR development and construction efforts and the larger universe of full-size reactors, all of which have taken significantly longer than projected to begin commercial operation.”",
            "As to the projects being “too risky”, IEEFA simply says the cost increases and construction delays that have plagued the SMR sector already “will push enormous financial and time risks onto",
            "customers, potentially undercutting their interest and ability in pursuing such projects. Aware of these risk-related problems, the Department of Energy has floated several ideas to get the government involved in the buildout of the SMR sector. These include providing “cost overrun insurance,” other undefined financial assistance, becoming an owner or serving as a buyer for the power. None of these options would reduce the development risk—they would simply transfer those risks and the associated costs to US taxpayers",
            "In conclusion, IEEFA says it released its first analysis of the SMR sector more than two years ago, “concluding that the much-hyped resource would be too slow, too expensive and too risky to help in the transition away from fossil fuels”. It added: “We stand by that conclusion.”",
            "The report notes: “Perhaps most concerning is the risk factor, especially when compared to the known costs and construction timelines for readily available wind, solar and battery storage resources. … At least 375,000 MW of new renewable energy generating capacity is likely to be added to the US grid in the next seven years. By contrast, IEEFA believes it is highly unlikely any SMRs will be brought online in that same time frame. The comparison couldn’t be clearer. Regulators, utilities, investors and government officials should acknowledge this and embrace the available reality: Renewables are the near-term solution.”",
            "The report makes several recommendations:",
            "Regulators who will be asked to approve utility or developer-backed SMR proposals should craft restrictions to prevent delays and cost increases from being pushed onto ratepayers.",
            "Utilities that are considering SMRs should be required to compare the technology’s uncertain costs and completion dates with the known costs and construction timetables of renewable alternatives. Utilities that still opt for the SMR option should be required to put shareholder funds at risk if costs and construction times exceed utility estimates.",
            "Investors and bankers weighing any SMR proposal should carefully conduct their due diligence. Things will go wrong, imperiling the chances for full recovery of any invested funds.",
            "State and federal governments should require that estimated SMR construction costs and schedules be publicly available so that utility ratepayers, taxpayers and investors are better able to assess the magnitude of the SMR-related financial risks that they may be forced to bear.",
            "Finally, it is vital that this debate consider the opportunity costs associated with the SMR push. The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years—years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.",
            "IEEFA says its mission “is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy”. It adds that its market-based research “shows how the rise of the new energy economy, where renewable energy sources are steadily eroding reliance on fossil fuels, makes financial sense for investors, governments, businesses, communities and ratepayers”.",
            "In line with this mission, the new report says: “The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years – years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.”"

        "text": [
            "Bulgaria’s Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) has announced its decision to terminate the contract with Russia for the supply of nuclear fuel, according to plant executive director Valentin Nikolov. The contract was due to end in 2025. He added that Russian fuel already delivered will now serve as a reserve.",
            "He made the comments during a ceremony marking the loading of the last of the initial 43 cassettes containing nuclear fuel from US-based Westinghouse at Kozloduy NPP’s unit 5. The unit, which was closed for scheduled maintenance, is due to resume operations on 9 June. Nikolov emphasised that the price of American fuel is comparable to the Russian fuel. Simultaneously, negotiations are underway with the French company Framatome for the supply of nuclear fuel for Kozloduy unit 6. The last loading of unit 6 with Russian fuel will take place in the autumn. In October-November 2025, the reactor will operate in part with French fuel, which is a prototype of the current Russian TVSA.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6), which provide about 34% of Bulgaria’s electricity Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades. Kozloduy 5&6 were due to be decommissioned in 2027 and 2029 but have undergone refurbishment and life extension programmes to enable extension of operation from 30 to 60 years. Unit 5 was connected to the grid in 1987 and unit 6 in 1991.",
            "In April, Bulgaria’s Nuclear Regulatory Agency (AYaR – Agentsiyata za Yadreno Regulirane) licensed the use of the Westinghouse fuel for unit 5, the first 43 cartridges of which had already been delivered to the site. A 10-year contract with Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB for fuel supply for unit 5 was signed at the end of 2022. The new American fuel arrived at Kozloduy NPP by ship from Sweden.",
            "The permit is for a step-by-step transition to the new Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assembly RWFA fuel from the Russian TVEL fuel which is currently used. An earlier permit was issued in January for storage of the fuel at the site. The process of partial refuelling and parallel operation of both fuels will continue for four years. Only a quarter of fresh nuclear fuel will be replaced during the coming four fuel campaigns.",
            "“Today we are present at a historic moment… since, in the 50-year history of the Kozloduy NPP, the plant will operate with an alternative fuel for the first time,” commented Vladimir Malinov, Acting Minister of Energy at the ceremony.",
            "Kenneth Merten, the Ambassador of the United States in Bulgaria said: “Nuclear fuel diversification in Bulgaria is a first step towards diversification. The step was taken by several governments. I congratulate you on your vision. I believe that Bulgaria will become an energy hub after diversifying its fuel sources.”",
            "Caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev said this was the first stage of a real diversification of the nuclear fuel process. “This it is truly the beginning of the separation of Bulgaria from the almost complete dependence on Russia…. And without politicising, I will say that it is always good to have a choice. Diversification provides us with exactly that – a choice that gives better opportunities with 100% safety and security.” He noted that the first discussions with Westinghouse took place 2009-2010.",
            "“Kozloduy NPP celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2024 and it is a pleasure for us to contribute to the diversification of nuclear fuel supplies for this valuable customer of ours with this first charge”, said Tariq Choho, President of the Nuclear Fuel Department at Westinghouse."

        "title": "The eVinci microreactor: power in small packages",
        "text": [
            "Above: The eVinci microreactor has been designed for a wealth of power and heating applications",
            "Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor is a transportable 5 MWe nuclear power plant designed to be as versatile as possible. With multiple applications on the cards, the reactor could see its first deployment in Canada following an agreement with Saskatchewan Research Council to explore industrial, research and energy use applications. With C$80m (US$59m) in government funding to support licensing and other work for the project, the reactor is scheduled to be completed in 2029. Following a tie-in with Canadian firm Prodigy Clean Energy, the reactor is also being assessed and designed to be deployed commercially at the heart of a floating power station as a mobile power pack for multiple applications. Eddie Saab, Vice President eVinci Market Development and President at Westinghouse Electric Canada Inc, outlines the thinking behind the eVinci design: “Several years ago our engineers were assessing various technologies that would fit end uses for remote communities and off-grid applications for industrial customers who don’t have access to grid power. The engineers determined the heat pipe reactor technology which Los Alamos National Labs in the US had been using for creating electricity for the NASA space programme would be ideal.” He continues: “It was very small scale just using uranium to heat up heat pipes and converting that heat into electricity. Westinghouse licensed the technology and then went on an engineering research and development programme to scale that technology up to be commercially viable.”",
            "That design programme has now resulted in the eVinci microreactor. In the eVinci unit, decay heat is removed via natural convection through air-to-air hear exchangers.",
            "The core transfers heat to the heat tube canister which, Westinghouse says, provides reliable heat removal to the atmosphere using natural convection and without the need for operator actions. “Some of the attributes that we really liked was that the technology when fully operational actually has no moving parts. It doesn’t use any external water sources either,” he says.",
            "This is one of the passive safety features of the design. The use of passive heat pipes rather than a liquid heat removal system eliminates the need for reactor coolant and associated systems as well as cooling water, simplifying the design and removing loss of coolant-type incidents from the equation. The system all doesn’t have any pumps and he machinery typically needed in a nuclear power plant or indeed any power plant that generates power from boiling water into steam.",
            "Saab explains: “The rector itself is taking ambient air, heating up the air and then exhausting hot air into essentially a reverse jet engine. It’s a Brayton cycle power conversion unit. For customers who require just hot process heat you can do away with the power conversion unit and leverage the hot air. Typically, we’re going to see a need for both with some customers requiring high quality process heat for industrial applications, but also power generation for electricity. Using it for electricity, still provides about 7 MWth at about 1500C so there could be applications in a micro grid or a community or maybe a university where both 5 MW of electricity and about 7 MW of process heat is needed. Any process or industrial applications that require high temperature heat are suitable.”",
            "Saab is keen to emphasise that the design team kept a keen focus on commercial considerations, saying: “There needs to be a sweet spot between the output and the cost for it to be commercially valid and that’s the balance that they’ve gone through the past several years.”",
            "Another safety consideration in the design is its use of TRISO accident-tolerant fuel. TRISO fuel, 19.75% enriched, is structurally more resistant to neutron irradiation, corrosion, oxidation, and high temperatures than traditional reactor fuels. Saab expands on this: “We selected TRISO really because of the robustness of the fuel with uranium encapsulated by graphite. The coating on the TRISO fuel is carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of fission products due to the higher melting point than uranium preventing the potential release risk. We chose it because of that technology and that safety ability.” He adds that many of the micro reactors and next generation SMRs have made the same design choice because of the robustness and the safety factors and is confident that fuel supply won’t be an issue despite the current lack of commercially available TRISO fuels. “There are a number of vendors out there working to manufacture TRISO, as well as Westinghouse which has got a fully vertical nuclear fuel supply chain. We’re assessing all options, either buy it or make it and we will have to evaluate to see what the best thing is for Westinghouse and our customers. We haven’t decided what that path would be as of yet,” he says. In any event, TRISO fuel is standardised so all the design and licensing requirements can be addressed before that decision becomes an issue.",
            "The path to commercialisation",
            "Westinghouse has revealed an ambitious time frame for both completion of the microreactor’s design and subsequent licensing and commercial roll-out. “We are aiming to have the design completed in 2028. Last November we announced our first customer, Saskatchewan Research Council. They would like to have an eVinci for their use in 2029. In, terms of licensing, we are working on both sides of the [US-Canadian] border right now. With the NRC in the US and with the CNSC in Canada where we’re going through the Vendor Design Review process. That is providing white papers and topical reports of Westinghouse efforts to get them familiar with the technology. That way when we do enter the formal licensing process, which will typically come from the customer license to prepare a site, likely Saskatchewan Research Council, then the regulator will be more familiar with the eVinci technology. For the NRC we’re doing the same and getting feedback on what’s working and what needs to be improved. We’re really putting ourselves in the best position for when customers start placing orders and we can be expedient through the licensing process,” says Saab.",
            "Having achieved NRC and CNSC approval, the goal is to see an accelerated commercial roll out on the basis that it is a small unit and therefore potentially offers advantages in installation and commissioning.",
            "As Saab says: “The benefit of a microreactor is they could be factory manufactured and taken to site. Essentially if the site is already prepped and ready with the infrastructure there our goal is to be able to make the connection and have it up and running in 30 days. Very different from a large capital construction of a gigawatt reactor.”",
            "To facilitate serial manufacturing and a production line approach, Westinghouse already has plans in place, notably at the Etna facility near Pittsburg, Pennsylvania in the United States, which will be used for manufacturing all heat pipes for the demonstration unit as well as feature in the initial production of future commercial units.",
            "Above: Westinghouse plans to develop serial manufacturing and a production line approach at its Etna facility in Pittsburgh, USA",
            "“We’ve made a significant investment in Etna,” says Saab, adding: “It’s also where the majority of the eVinci business unit team resides and that will be an accelerator hub for eVinci, where we will manufacture the first several units. As we get to fleet deployments and forecast out the demand for the technology, we’ll have to evaluate how to scale up manufacturing. That will be decided by our manufacturing team at the time.”",
            "The goal for the eVinci design will be transporting the fully manufactured unit to its operating location loaded with fuel. There it is expected to run for at least eight years before the complete unit will be returned to Westinghouse for refurbishment and refuelling. If required a replacement unit will be installed at the site simultaneously.",
            "Saab explains: “We’ve designed the technology to be modular and envision about four, maybe five ISO containers for the system to be transported to site. We believe that the reactor itself will require a bit larger container, but will still be transportable through traditional methods. The goal has always beenl to design a technology that was transportable so that we can take advantage of manufacturing at scale. At the end of a fuel cycle we envision a swap out method, with no refuelling or handling of spent fuel at site. We would remove the reactor with the spent fuel and take it back to a dedicated site. If a customer needs continued operations we’ll probably need about 24 hours to do the swap out there. Otherwise, they can have pretty much uninterrupted power.”",
            "be transportable by conventional means with many components fitting inside standard ISO containers",
            "He continues: “In terms of the fuel, the plan is to bring it back to a Westinghouse facility and do the defuel and the refuelling and handle the waste management side of things. How we handle the transportation and the transport of a fuelled eVinci and a defuelled eVinci will really be dependent on the regulator in the specific country. That’s why we’re working really closely with the CNRC and the NRC to ensure that we meet all the requirements. We would do the same thing with the regulators in any other area as well. There are some nuances, but they’re all based on the IAEA regulatory requirements for nuclear power plants so there would be a lot of similarities.”",
            "Refuelling cycles aside, the units are designed for at least 40 years of service life although some components will probably need to be refurbished after initial operations. As the next step in the development programme, Westinghouse will be installing a nuclear test reactor at the Idaho National Labs by 2026. This will be a scaled down version with a capacity of 1 MWe. “The nuclear test reactor will give us critical data, not only informing the design, but also licensing and lifespan,” says Saab.",
            "Given the ambitious plans for that commercial eventuality there is clearly still significant work to do in validating the design of the reactor. Says Saab: “We’ve validated that the heat pipe technology can be scaled. We started with 4 foot [1 metre] heat pipes, and now we’re creating 12 foot heat pipes [4 metre]. Eventually for the full-scale design, the heat pipes will be just over 20 feet [5 metre].” Nonetheless, Saab acknowledges there are challenges that lie ahead: “I think one challenge will be overlapping the regulatory requirements for nuclear as well as the requirements for marine-based vessels. Timing will also be a challenge and also ensuring the process is commercially viable, finding the sweet spot between timing and cost is the key.”",
            "Given that sweet spot is reached, Saab is optimistic that there are numerous applications that match the eVinci’s design outputs. “The luxury of what we’re developing is that the customer base is going to be quite broad. From remote industrial sites, data centres, communities, government installations, islands and island nations all requiring this nuclear battery. Although we’re proceeding this way because we’ve seen strong interests from the Canadian and the US markets, but we anticipate growth elsewhere too. We signed an MOU with ENEC, the Emirates Nuclear Energy Company, in the UAE, for instance and we’re discussing with additional customers and in other geographies. We do see eVinci supporting customers across Europe, to Africa, to the Middle East and even Australia when they lift their moratorium on nuclear. This will be a geographic solution for anyone requiring 5 MWe of clean, safe energy. And, if required and the end customer requires the heat as opposed to electricity, you can also get about 15 MW of thermal energy, that’s hot air at about 8000C. It is pretty dynamic technology that really allows nuclear to participate in areas that we’ve never participated before. Barge-mounted transportable EVINCI nuclear batteries will open the market to end users with siting challenges.”",
            "A barge-mounted transportable plant is currently being developed in partnership with Canadian firm Prodigy Clean Energy. Westinghouse is working with the company on two projects, one marine or land-based and a grid-scale version installed at a shoreline within a protected harbour. In a related development Prodigy also recently signed a separate Memorandum of Understanding to explore potential TNPP projects with First Nations, Inuit, and Métis across Canada. The goal is to identify ways in which Indigenous Peoples could have ownership in the new generation of nuclear plants.",
            "As Saab concludes: “It’s exciting to take our eVinci and find additional applications previously not able to leverage the many attributes of nuclear. Think of it as a battery pack, and our battery pack can be put on a barge, on piles on the shoreline, on a concrete pad and one day soon in space – it really depends on the customer and the environment and what the ultimate end need is.”"

            "California-based start-up Radiant Industries and Amsted Graphite Materials have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) aimed at strengthening the domestic supply chain for nuclear-grade graphite. As part of the increased collaboration, Radiant has placed a significant purchase order with Amsted Graphite Materials for its PCEA nuclear-grade graphite to support Radiant’s development of their Kaleidos microreactor.",
            "Radiant has been selected as one of three advanced nuclear energy developers to receive funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) for developing and testing microreactor designs using the Demonstration of Microreactor Experiments (DOME) test bed at Idaho National Laboratory. DOE, through the National Reactor Innovation Centre (NRIC), awarded $3.9m to Radiant, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (UNSC) and Westinghouse to design experiments to test microreactor designs at DOME.",
            "Radiant Industries was set up in 2019 by former SpaceX engineers. Its Kaleidos design is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) which will use TRISO fuel, a helium coolant, and a graphite moderator. All components will be fitted in a single shipping container to facilitate rapid deployment. It is designed to produce 1.2MWe or 1.9 MWt for heating or water desalination, as a potential replacement for diesel generators. Following testing that is scheduled to begin in 2026, Radiant targets commercial production units in 2028.",
            "The success of Radiant’s Kaleidos Demonstration Project, along with the viability of subsequent commercial projects, will depend in critical part on supply certainty and affordability of nuclear-grade, medium and fine grain graphite required for application in a nuclear environment.",
            "Amsted Graphite Materials, part of the Chicago-based diversified manufacturing conglomerate Amsted Industries, is the largest US-owned synthetic graphite producer. “By joining forces to secure a reliable supply of critical graphite materials, we are investing in the success of our Kaleidos Demonstration Project and laying a solid foundation for the future of clean energy in the United States,” said Tori Shivanandan, Chief Operating Officer of Radiant.",
            "The MOU underscores the commitment of Radiant and Amsted Graphite Materials to reduce reliance on foreign sources of nuclear-grade graphite, enhance US advanced manufacturing capabilities and strengthen the security of US nuclear energy supply chains. Key objectives include collaborative efforts in policy advocacy at federal, state and local levels, strategic discussions with third parties, exploration of public-private partnerships with the US government, and participation in testing and R&D programmes with universities and government laboratories.",
            "“Our collaboration with Radiant is a significant step toward strengthening America’s nuclear energy infrastructure,” said Gavin Noel, Vice President and General Manager of Amsted Graphite Materials. “As the United States moves toward a cleaner, more resilient energy future, our partnership underscores the essential role of graphite in ensuring the security and sustainability of innovative technologies.”",
            "Amsted Graphite Materials signed a partnership agreement to establish an integrated domestic supply chain for nuclear-grade graphite with small modular reactor developer X-energy in 2022. X-energy’s Xe-100 high-temperature gas-cooled reactor is also designed to use synthetic graphite as a moderator."

            "Bulgaria’s Council of Ministers has decided that the National Electricity Company (NEK -Natsionalnata Elektricheska Kompaniya) is to sell some equipment stored at the suspended Belene NPP project to Kozloduy NPP to extend the operating life of Kozloduy units 5&6.",
            "The Belene project envisaged the construction of two Russian VVER-1000/V-466 reactors and preliminary site works began in 2008. Contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers. The plant was to be built by Atomstroyexport (part of Rosatom) after Russia won an international tender in 2006 but the project was cancelled in 2012, after a change of government. It was revived again briefly in 2018 after a series of arbitration procedures, which saw Bulgaria pay €601.6m ($691.5m) in compensation to Atomstroyexport for the equipment already manufactured. These components are now stored at the construction site. NEK said in August 2023 that it will be able to continue to conserve the equipment delivered for units 1&2 of Belene NPP” with technical assistance from Atomstroyexport.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6), which are due to be decommissioned in 2027 and 2029. Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades.",
            "Rusatom Service earlier carried out several projects at Kozloduy, including a feasibility study for life extension. However, following the conflict in Ukraine, Russian involvement in Bulgaria’s nuclear programme has ended. The Kozloduy units are being switched from using Russian supplied fuel to fuel supplied by Westinghouse.",
            "In February 2024, Bulgaria and the US signed a formal agreement to collaborate on the construction of new units at Kozloduy (7&8). The document outlines cooperation in nuclear power development and technology exchange. While the units are to have Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, Westinghouse will not take part in the construction but will retain overall control of the project.",
            "The value of the Belene equipment to be transferred to Kozloduy is nearly BGN1m $554,000). An independent appraiser will determine the initial selling price, and the transaction will be carried out by direct negotiation between the two companies, according to regulations set out in the Public Enterprises Act. The Council of Ministers said implementation of the transaction will ensure the security of the equipment at Kozloduy as well as the optimisation of the time for carrying out repair activities.",
            "This is not the first time NEK, was permitted to sell Belene components to Kozloduy. Filters, fans and other equipment were sold two years ago to be used in repair programmes at units 5&6.",
            "Separately, the National Assembly earlier instructed the Minister of Energy to start negotiations with Ukraine for the sale of the two Belene reactor pressure vessels and accompanying equipment for completion of units 3&4 at its Khmelnitsky NPP. Bulgaria expects at least BGN 1.2m for the equipment but so far no agreement has been finalised although talks with Ukraine are continuing.",
            "Meanwhile, in a recent podcast reported by Novinite Business, Professor Georgi Kaschiev, atomic physicist, former Chairman of the Committee for the Use of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes and scientific supervisor for the commissioning of Kozloduy 7, expressed concerns about plans for the plant.",
            "He noted that in eight years there will be nowhere to store used fuel from the existing Kozloduy NPP. “First, this fuel emits heat, that is, it must always be in an environment that ensures its cooling, and it must be placed in a specific way”, he said. He explained that after three years in the used fuel pools the fuel is transferred to onsite storage “and can stay there for decades”. However, space in the repository is decreasing. “So far, we have dealt with this because the used fuel was transported to Russia, where it was processed and temporarily stored. In this way we periodically made space in our storage. For the past two years, however, Russia has been unable to take the fuel…. If the used fuel is not transported, our storage will reach capacity in 2032.”",
            "He added: “I was appointed as the head of a working group to update the spent fuel storage strategy. In this programme, we set out to start negotiations with France and to explore the options for processing our fuel at French factories. France has two plants for processing such fuel, which do not operate at full capacity. However, such a decision requires political will.”",
            "He was especially concerned about mixing Russian fuel with the fuel of the Westinghouse. He explained that there is a risk of abrasion between two adjacent cartridges, which may lead to depressurisation. “The other thing that worries me is that our contract with the Russians for internal reactor control has expired and they will no longer provide data on their cartridges that remain in the reactor. And these data are very important for the whole process. A big problem may arise here.”"

            "Slovenia’s state-owned power company, GEN energija, and the Milan Vidmar Electrical Institute (EMV – Elektroinštitut Milan Vidmar) have presented new studies and internal economic calculations related to the JEK2 nuclear new build project. Slovenia plans to build a new nuclear plant (Krško-II) adjacent to the existing NPP, a 696 MWe pressurised water reactor co-owned by neighbouring Croatia. The plant generates about a third of the Slovenia’s electricity. Krško-II, the JEK2 project, would have up to 2400 MWe capacity. The project will be subject of a referendum later this year.",
            "A nuclear power plant with a pressurised water reactor (PWR), similar to the existing unit operated by Slovenian nuclear utility Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško (NEK). The reason for the use of pressurised water technology is the knowledge and experience that NEK and scientific institutions have accumulated over the last 40 years, both in terms of operation and administrative control. In October, GEN energija CEO Dejan Paravan said three technology providers were being considered – US Westinghouse, France’s EDF and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power – who all had strengths and “the decision will not be easy”.",
            "The new study showed that, with respect to the impact on the electric power network, the optimal size of JEK2 is up to 1,300 MWe of net electric power. Based on the data collected and received so far, which represents the best internal assessment of GEN energija, the estimated investment value of JEK2 puts overnight construction costs at €9.3bn ($10bn) for a power plant of 1,000 MWe and €15.4bn for a plant of 1,650 MWe.",
            "GEN energija has sent the draft material for the JEK2 State Spatial Plan (DPN – državnega prostorskega načrta) for review to the Ministry of Environment, Climate & Energy (MOPE – Ministrstvo za Okolje, Podnebje in Energijo) and the Ministry of Natural Resources & Spatial Planning (MNVP – Ministrstvo za Naravne Vire in Prostor) for coordination.",
            "Dr Robert Bergant, head of the GEN engineering department, gave an estimated timeline with milestones, from the start of DPN preparation this year to plant construction in 2039. After harmonizing the comments of the competent ministries on the proposed DPN Initiative there will be a public presentation, during which the spatial planning authorities will offer guidelines, and the public will be able to make suggestions and ask questions. This will be followed by an analysis of the guidelines and adoption of a government decision on the DPN Initiation. An environmental report will then be prepared as part of a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and technology study. The adoption of the DPN Regulation is planned for 2027, followed by a final investment decision (FID) in 2028, the issue of a building permit, and the start of construction in 2032.",
            "Kruno Abramovič, Executive Director for Finance at GEN energija said the financial structure and sources of financing will be known and determined before the FID. GEN energija alone is not able to provide all the financial resources for JEK2, therefore the role of the state in the implementation of such an important strategic project will be crucial, he noted. The plant will provide a stable and reliable supply of electricity for at least 60 (and possible 80) years and will provide an estimated 5,640 new jobs in 10 years.",
            "GEN energija will open an information office in the Krško Municipality in June. In order to raise awareness and inform the wider Slovenian public about the JEK2 project, GEN energija is holding a traveling presentation of the project in the form of an interactive centre over the coming months. GEN energija will also regularly publish information about the project on the JEK2 project website and provide objective media coverage of energy sources and the project through proactive and reactive communication with the media.",
            "Gorazd Slak, the head of Corporate Communication & Sustainability Development at GEN energija, said the public presentations would include models of what JEK2 would look like. He also emphasised the importance of transparency and the choice of the right providers. “These models, however, are in fact the actual NPPs of Korean KHNP, American Westinghouse and French EDF operators already standing and operating around the world”. He added that technical dialogue would continue with all three providers, “to be able to talk about achieving the best possible price”. He stressed the importance of making the procedures as transparent as possible.",
            "Meanwhile, the National Assembly, with the support of both coalition and opposition votes, has approved the call for a consultative referendum on the provision of electricity with the second unit at the Krsko NPP and other low-carbon sources. The National Assembly also adopted a resolution on the long-term peaceful use of nuclear energy in Slovenia. The programme document demonstrates political support for the continued use and development of nuclear energy, including the construction of JEK2. The referendum is expected to be held at the end of November."

Executive director of Kozloduy NPP – New Builds Petyo Ivanov was also present at the meeting. On the US side, the meeting was attended by the Assistant Secretary for International Affairs at the US Department of Energy (DOE), Andrew Light.",
            "Minister Malinov noted that cooperation with Washington is key for the development of Bulgaria’s nuclear industry and for achieving the goals related to the responsible use of nuclear energy. “Bulgaria wants its nuclear programme to continue to meet the highest standards of nuclear safety, security, reliability, and efficiency. Our country has a strong interest in leveraging the expertise of US government experts, regulators and the nuclear industry in maintaining this goal,” he said.",
            "The main topic of the first meeting of the steering committee was the need for timely implementation of the project to build a new nuclear power plant in Bulgaria with AP1000 technology. Westinghouse was awarded a front-end engineering & design contract with Kozloduy NPP subsidiary, Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild (KZNPP-NM – Kozloduy NPP Novi Mostnosti) in June 2023.

Plans to build a new NPP at Belene comprising two VVER-1000 reactors was cancelled in face of political and financial difficulties after the equipment was manufactured and supplied by Russia.",
            "Regarding the financing of the project, Malinov noted that according to the decision of the National Assembly of December 2023, the proceeds from the sale of the equipment of the cancelled Belene NPP project would be used to support construction of Kozloduy units 7&8. Currently, Bulgaria is hoping to sell the equipment to Ukraine for use at its Khmelnitsky NPP but as yet there is no agreement on price.",
            "In a bilateral meeting later, Minister Malinov and Assistant Secretary Andrew Light reconfirmed the two countries’ intention to build on their excellent cooperation to ensure energy security in the region.",
            "Malinov also had a meeting with Reta Jo Lewis, Chair of the Board of Directors and President of EXIM Bank. He said construction of new nuclear capacities at the Kozloduy NPP site is one of the main priorities in the work of the current government. “We are confident that, in close cooperation with our American partners from Westinghouse, we will be able to follow the schedule for the construction of unit 7 adopted by the National Assembly of Bulgaria. EXIM Bank is the official export credit agency of the US, whose mission is to support US companies in developing domestic and international projects.",

Lewis confirmed that financing the project in Bulgaria is a priority. She said the bank will initiate actions at operational level to secure financing according to the parliamentary timetable.",
            "“We are relying on EXIM Bank’s experience and expertise to ensure that Kozloduy NPP unit 7 is built on schedule. I am confident that with a bank of this stature joining the project, it will be even more attractive to other financing institutions,” Malinov said."

            "The UK government has selected Wylfa in Anglesey, North Wales, is its preferred site for a new NPP similar in scale to the one under construction at Hinkley Point C in Somerset. In March, Great British Nuclear (GBN) the arms-length body set up by the government to help deliver that extra capacity, acquired the Hitachi-owned sites for new nuclear at Wylfa and at Oldbury-on-Severn in southwest England for £160m ($203m). Both were considered as prospective sites for a new NPP but Wylfa has now been prioritised.",
            "The government said it is exploring building a major nuclear power station, similar in scale to Hinkley in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk. Wylfa, on the North Wales coast, is ideally suited to host a plant “given its proximity to cooling water and nuclear heritage” the project “would revive the nuclear history of Wylfa and bring thousands of jobs and investment to the area, boosting the local economy”.",
            "Wylfa has a long nuclear history. It hosted two 490 MWe Magnox reactors that began commercial operation in November 1971 and January 1972. Unit 2 was permanently shut in 2012 followed by unit 1 in 2015. Defuelling of the plant was completed in September 2019.",
            "Meanwhile, Horizon Nuclear Power announced plans to develop a new nuclear reactor at the site in 2009, years before the original plant closed. The plan was to develop two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactor units at Wylfa Newydd. In 2012, the Japanese company Hitachi offered to buy Horizon in a £700m deal spurring hopes that up to 6,000 jobs would be created during the construction phase, and 1,200 long-term jobs. However, in 2019 the plans faltered, with Hitachi citing spiralling costs. In 2020, the company withdrew its funding for the project entirely saying it had failed to reach a funding agreement with the UK government. A few months later Horizon Nuclear Power dropped its planning bid for the site.",
            "The government says it is now kickstarting talks with global energy firms to explore building the new power plant, bringing the UK closer to its ambition for up to a quarter of its projected electricity needs to come from domestic nuclear power by 2050.",
            "The government says the UK is delivering the biggest expansion to nuclear power in 70 years and suitable sites will be critical to meet ambitions to quadruple nuclear capacity by up to 24GW by 2050. This will come from a mix of traditional large-scale power plants and small modular reactors (SMRs), which can be rolled out more quickly and at scale.",
            "Gwen Parry-Jones CEO of Great British Nuclear said: “Having agreed to purchase the Wylfa site earlier this year, GBN looks forward to working with the government on the market engagement programme for large scale gigawatt providers and also delivering this vital project in the years to come.”",
            "Nuclear Industry Association CEO Tom Greatrex Chief Executive of the NIA said the government is “absolutely right” to pursue more large-scale nuclear alongside its SMR programme “Wylfa is an ideal place for a big nuclear project, and the community knows nuclear. We welcome the government’s engagement with potential partners internationally, and we urge them to move forward at pace. A large-scale project at Wylfa would be the single biggest inward investment in Welsh history, and a huge step towards both energy security and net zero for the whole country.”",
            "The Welsh Secretary, David TC Davies, said he would not “put a date” on when a power plant could be built and ready for production, but added that Wylfa was “destined to have a nuclear power station”.",
            "According to the Financial Times, Korea Electric Power Company (Kepco) has been in preliminary talks with ministers over the new Wylfa power plant. Bechtel and Westinghouse are also reported to have expressed interest."

        "text": [
            "Impressive recent growth in the SMR project pipeline is just one more element of a tidal wave forming for the next great nuclear breakthrough.",
            "In the first quarter of 2024 the small nuclear reactor (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW. This, according to a new report from analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, represents growth of some 65% in the three years since 2021.",
            "Noting that just five countries lead the project pipeline – Canada, the Korean Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States are driving some 58% of those projects – the WoodMac analysis adds that even the current global project pipeline would require an investment of close to US$176bn.",
            "It’s clearly a substantial growth rate and is backed by serious investment, even if the whole extent of the current pipeline never reaches a positive final investment decision. And it’s a district possibility, if not outright probability, that such a situation may come to pass as some of these projects fall by the wayside. After all, there are obvious risks to consider, particularly in light of the high profile NuScale retrenchment. As an industry leader – and still the only SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – NuScale had been widely seen as something of a flag-bearer for this burgeoning new nuclear industry.",
            "It’s understandable then that the decision to abandon the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) being developed in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) was taken by many as a significant blow to the credibility of SMRs as a whole.",
            "However, to reach that conclusion would undoubtedly be an ill-considered approach. NuScale may have taken a step backwards, but it is hardly in full-blown retreat. Almost immediately after the CFPP decision was announced Standard Power revealed plans to work with NuScale to develop two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Standard business is as a provider of services to data companies and this may be taken as a giant neon sign pointing to at least one of the underlying drivers behind a global SMR boom. The unabated growth of energy-hungry data centres is likely to see an early and productive partnership between the two industries. They certainly won’t be alone though, given Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also the founder of Terrapower with its 345 MWe Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor technology.",
            "There’s other clear evidence of gathering momentum behind an SMR-led nuclear market too. With multiple policy initiatives reflecting a new appraisal of nuclear in general, there are also SMR-specific government-backed measures designed to push SMR technologies off the drawing board and into operation. Important regulatory efforts underway include the US NRC, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) recently signing a trilateral deal to collaborate on SMR and advanced modular reactor (AMR) design assessment. The agreement is designed to enable both good practice and experience of reviewing SMR/AMR designs to be shared between the regulators. All three bodies are already engaged with SMR design assessment – the NRC is conducting pre-application activities with Westinghouse regarding design certification for its AP300 SMR, as well as with Holtec International for its SMR 300, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear for licensing approval of its BWRX-300 design, for example. This new measure marks an important step toward a unified regulatory framework that is so important to the success of SMRs that are expected to be deployed in many different jurisdictions.",
            "Given the underlying fundamentals it’s perhaps not so surprising that in their net zero scenario, WoodMac sees SMRs accounting for around a third of the global nuclear fleet. It’s not a cloudless horizon, inevitably there are both economic and technical risks and challenges that must be overcome and to do so will require a long-term concerted effort from government, regulators and the private sector. But taken in the round there is every indication that the 65% growth in the project pipeline seen over the last three years will come to be regarded as a pretty poor show in the years that follow."

            "CPS Energy has entered into an agreement to acquire an additional 2% ownership of the South Texas Nuclear Project (STP) from US Constellation, bringing CPS Energy’s ownership of STP to 42%. Constellation’s ownership will be reduced to 42%, and Austin Energy’s ownership will remain at 16% following the transaction. CPS Energy also entered into a long-term Purchase Power Agreement (PPA) with Constellation for an additional 200 MW of firm capacity that will be available for CPS Energy customers by the summer.",
            "Earlier in May, CPS Energy, Austin Energy, NRG, and Constellation resolved a series of disputes regarding the proposed sale of an interest in STP by NRG to Constellation South Texas and the related rights of first refusal of CPS Energy and Austin Energy.",
            "Constellation agreed in June 2023 to purchase NRG’s 44%stake in the plant – for $1.75bn. However, CPS and Austin Energy jointly filed a motion with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeking to dismiss or place on hold the licence transfer pending the outcome of a lawsuit CPS brought against NRG. CPS claimed a “right of first refusal” over the sale.",
            "CPS Energy and Austin Energy have now agreed to dismiss their pending litigation against NRG and Constellation and will withdraw their objections previously filed with NRC. “The addition of these megawatts to our system supports reliability for our customers as we enter another summer season,” said Rudy D Garza, President & CEO of CPS Energy.",
            "The additional 2% ownership of STP for CPS Energy equates to an additional 52 MWe of dispatchable generation to the portfolio and supports CPS Energy’s Vision 2027 plan that envisages the retirement of 2,249 MWe of older generation capacity before 2030. To date, CPS Energy has added 1,710 MWe of natural gas, 730 MWe of solar energy and 50 MWe of energy storage as part of its generation plan.",

Eletronuclear’s Long Term Operations (LTO) programme is designed to enable continued operations at Angra 1 until the end of 2044. The current operating licence is valid to December 2024.",
            "Angra NPP has two operating pressurised water reactors (PWRs) – the 640 MWe Angra 1, supplied by US Westinghouse Electric Company, which was connected to the grid in 1985 and the 1,350 MWe Angra 2, supplied by Siemens, which began operation in 2001. Discussions are ongoing on completion of Angra 3, which was 67% complete when work stopped in 2015 due to the collapse of financial support.",
            "Eletronuclear said it had already undertaken years of preparation towards life extension even before the initial request for renewal of its operating licence was submitted to the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN – Comissào National de Energia Nuclear) in 2019. Westinghouse in 2020 signed a contract with Eletronuclear to conduct engineering analyses critical to the safety, reliability and long-term operation of Angra 1.",
            "In 2023, Eletronuclear submitted 16 reports to the regulatory body, containing, among other things, assessments of the safety factors defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Based on these, CNEN issued 166 requirements, which were analysed and answered by the technical team of Eletronuclear with support from the Amazul company in April this year.",
            "Eletronuclear has also carried out the third and final Periodic Safety Reassessment (PSR), a document required every 10 years to review safety performance, emergency planning, radiological impact on the environment, management system, safety culture, equipment qualification and the experience of other plants. The PSR was submitted to CNEN in December 2023.",
            "In addition, Eletronuclear also uses the US License Renewal Application (LRA) process, which is administered by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), to demonstrate the ability of Angra 1 to operate for another two decades. The LRA provides a detailed breakdown of reactor safety and integrity through engineering analysis, safety testing and reviews, etc. The material was delivered in October 2019 to CNEN. Two revisions have already been made, and a third is underway.",
            "Eletronuclear is also preparing for a fourth visit in June by an IAEA Safety Aspects of Long Term Operation (SALTO) mission – the previous ones were held in 2013, 2018 and 2022.",
            "“The negotiation process with CNEN should last until the end of this year to finalise the steps,” said José Augusto do Amaral, superintendent of Operational Support Engineering and responsible for the LTO. “But the company is prepared and continues to have constant dialogue … we are managing to demonstrate that Angra 1 will be able to continue operating efficiently and safely.”",
            "According to Eletronuclear, significant advances have already been made to prepare the plant to operate for another 20 years. These include replacement of steam generators, application of weld overlay in the nozzles of the pressuriser, change of the reactor pressure vessel cover and replacement of the main transformers. Some programs were also implemented, such as ageing management, obsolescence management, as well as inspections and maintenance of plant systems, structures and components.",
            "Safety and modernisation projects will be carried out between 2024 and 2028 using investment of BRL3bn ($585m). Eletronuclear said it is negotiating a bridging loan of about BRL 800m with its main shareholders, ENBPar and Eletrobras, to finance the investments already made in 2024 and those still planned in the current year. This is a short-term solution to ensure the extension of the service life of Angra 1, while the company negotiates the financing with US Eximbank for the necessary funding to 2028.",
            "Eletronuclear noted that Angra 1was supplied by Westinghouse on a turnkey basis “which did not provide for technology transfer”. However, “the experience accumulated by Eletronuclear in all these years of commercial operation, with efficiency indicators that exceed that of many similar plants has enabled the company to carry out a continuous technological improvement programme and incorporate the latest advances in the nuclear industry.”"

EDF is proposing its EPR1200 reactor, KHNP is proposing its APR1000.",
            "EDF, KHNP and Westinghouse, submitted binding bids in October for a fifth unit at the Dukovany NPP and non-binding offers for up to three more units – a sixth at Dukovany and two at the Temelín NPP. However, in February the Czech government changed the tender to be binding offers for four new units, excluding Westinghouse, which was proposing its AP1000 reactor, because it \"did not meet the necessary conditions\". Prime Minister Petr Fiala noted that contracting for four units could have a 25% benefit in terms of costs compared with individual bids.",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002.",

            "It is expected that the contracts will be finalised during this year and ready for signing by 31 March 2025. “The final signing of the contracts will be followed by a thorough preparation of design and planning documentation so as to meet the deadline for the start of the test operation of the new unit in 2036.”",
            "In parallel with the tender procedure, EDU II has been working on other parts of the project. After the Ministry of the Environment issued a positive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2019, EDU II received a Siting Permit from the State Office for Nuclear Safety and a Generating Plant Authorization from the Ministry of Industry and Trade in 2021. A non-final zoning decision was issued on 30 October 2023.",
            "EDF said its Updated Initial Bid Supplement covers the supply of engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning activities for up to four EPR1200 reactors at the Dukovany site (units 5&6), and at the Temelín site (units 3&4). The offer also covers the design and implementation activities for nuclear fuel and delivery of fuel assemblies for this programme.",
            "The bid “is based on the proven and complementary skills of EDF, its industrial partners and the Czech Nuclear Industry”. It integrates EDF’s and its industrial partners’ experience in maximising the full potential of twin and fleet-effect. “Through its proposal, EDF proposes to be the single source of supply and integration of the EPR1200 technology and its project execution”, while relying on:",

The technological and industrial alignment between Paris and Prague that we propose holds the potential to reshape Europe’s new nuclear industry for generations to come.\"",
            "KHNP CEO Dr Jooho Whang delivered an updated binding offer for the construction of new nuclear units to CEZ headquarters. In addition to the fifth unit at Dukovany, the offer includes binding options for three additional units, which are the sixth unit for Dukovany and two more units at Temelin.",
            "“With successful projects in Korea and the United Arab Emirates, KHNP has proven that it builds on time, with quality and at the agreed price,” said Whang. “We believe that KHNP is the best option for the Czech Republic in terms of timely completion of the first reactor by 2036 and energy security,” he added.",
            "KHNP is offering the APR1000 reactor with an output of 1,050 MWe. “It has already received EUR certification last year, which confirms that the APR1000 meets the highest European standards in the areas of safety, economic criteria and constructability,” KHNP noted. The reactor has been designed by KHNP specifically for export to European countries and has been localised to meet European conditions and comply with requirements based on the latest International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Western European Nuclear Regulators Association (WENRA) standards.",
            "KHNP said it has been active in the Czech Republic since 2016, when preparations for the tender began. Since then, the company has been actively developing relationships not only with the Czech government, but also with universities and potential suppliers. “Cooperation with Czech companies is a long-term priority for KHNP. Since 2016, KHNP has identified over 200 potential Czech suppliers and signed more than 50 Memoranda of Understanding as a basis for future cooperation. In addition, KHNP is the only bidder counting on a Czech company for the delivery of the turbine, which is one of the most important and largest components in the nuclear power plant. The South Korean company is thus trying to maximize the share of Czech suppliers in the project, as requested by the Czech side.”",
            "KHNP has also built a good reputation in the Trebic region, where the first of the new nuclear units is to be constructed. “In addition to supporting the local hockey club, it regularly organizes trips of South Korean volunteers who help with charity activities and try to introduce Korean culture to the local population…. During the covid pandemic, KHNP also donated masks and other hygiene supplies to schools, nursing homes and town halls in the region.”",
            "Meanwhile, the European Commission (EC) announced it had approved, under EU state-aid rules, the Czech government's support of the construction of the new nuclear. The EC, which began its investigation in June 2022, said that the proposals had been modified to take account of concerns during the process. The Commission \"concluded that the aid is appropriate to achieve the objectives pursued, as well as proportionate as it is limited to the minimum necessary, while the competition distortions caused by the measure are minimised”. The beneficiary of the measure is EDU II.",
            "Czechia plans to grant direct price support in the form of a power purchasing contract with a State-owned Special Purpose Vehicle. The contract will ensure stable revenues for the nuclear power plant for a period of 40 years. The beneficiary will also benefit of a subsidised state loan to cover a majority of the construction costs and a protection mechanism against unforeseen events or policy changes that may make the realisation of the project impossible.",
            "EC Executive Vice-President in charge of competition policy, Margrethe Vestager, said the Commission’s role is to ensure that the state aid proposed is targeted, proportionate and does not unduly affect the EU energy market. “During our investigation Czechia has modified the initial measure and submitted substantial commitments. This has allowed us to approve the aid.”",
            "The commitments entail certain restrictions. The EC said that to \"ensure that the aid is proportionate and does not unduly distort the functioning of the electricity market\" Czechia had \"introduced a remuneration formula akin to a two-way contract-for-difference, which provides revenue stability and limits excess remuneration through a yearly ex-post settlement\". This effectively means that if electricity prices are below the agreed level, the nuclear project will receive a subsidy to make it up to the agreed price, and if electricity prices are above the agreed price, the nuclear project would pay money back to the government.",
            "The added that the period of direct price support had been cut from 60 years to 40 years and the strike price was being set \"on the basis of a discounted cash flow model ensuring that the total aid amount, taking into account the subsidised loan, is limited to the funding gap of the project … EDU II's shareholders will get a rate of return equal to the market return that investors would require on a similar investment\".",
            "There will also be a clawback mechanism lasting for the operational lifetime of the plant to ensure \"additional gains generated by the project will be shared with the Czech state\" and \"to avoid market concentration and remove the risk that the measure provides an advantage to certain electricity consumers, Czechia has committed to ensure that at least 70% of the power output will be sold on the open power exchange – namely, day-ahead, intraday and futures markets – over the entire lifetime of the power plant. The rest of output can be sold on objective, transparent and non-discriminatory terms by way of auctions\".",

        "text": [
            "Rolls-Royce SMR has reportedly revised its plans to build two nuclear factories in the UK due ongoing delays in the government’s small modular reactor (SMR) design competition. In December 2023, six SMR designs were selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK The winning bidders were EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK The contracts were expected to be awarded in spring 2024 but this has now been postponed to June 2024 at the earliest.",
            "Rolls-Royce had planned two separate factories: one for heavy pressure vessels, critical components for reactors, and another for assembling the modular units of the SMRs. A shortlist for the pressure vessel factory included the International Advanced Manufacturing Park on the outskirts of Sunderland, as well as the Gateway industrial park in Deeside, Wales.",
            "However, Rolls-Royce says it no longer has time to build it and make the first pressure vessels by the early 2030s when it had hoped to launch its first SMRs. Rolls-Royce will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third-party supplier. Plans for the second factory will still go ahead. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce SMR told the Daily Telegraph that the company had now “prioritised work on our modules assembly and test facility”. It added: “Our efforts are focused on identifying the best site to support our deployment at pace.”",
            "The sites considered for the pressure vessel factory could now be shortlisted for the second plant, but no decision has yet been made. The company may revive plans for a heavy pressure vessel factory sometime in the future, provided that it manages to build up a robust pipeline of orders. A UK government spokesman said: “Our world leading SMR competition aims to be the fastest of its kind, helping secure billions in investment for the UK, meaning cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term.”",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWt. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK.",

            "An IAEA team, including three experts from Brazil, the UK and the US, as well as seven IAEA staff reviewed infrastructure development for the Polish Nuclear Power Programme (PNPP). The PNPP was approved in January 2014 by the Polish Council of Ministers. The establishment of nuclear power is an objective of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, which sets the framework for energy transition to strengthen energy security and to reduce reliance on coal power plants to meet climate goals. In 2022, the Polish Government announced that the first NPP will comprise three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, with the first unit to be commissioned in 2033.",
            "The Phase 2 Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was carried out at the invitation of the Government of Poland, and hosted by the Ministry of Climate & Environment. The team reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the IAEA evaluation methodology for Phase 2 of the Milestones Approach, which evaluates the readiness of a country to invite bids or negotiate a contract for a first NPP.",
            "Before the Phase 2 INIR mission, Poland prepared a self-evaluation report covering all 19 nuclear power infrastructure issues and submitted the report and supporting documents to the IAEA.",
            "The team identified good practices that would benefit other countries developing nuclear power in the areas of contracting approach, strategic approach to funding, early authorisation of technical support organisations to support the nuclear regulator, engagement with the electrical grid operator, stakeholder involvement and industrial involvement.",
            "“The Polish nuclear power programme was initiated with clear objectives and is progressing towards the construction stage in a structured way,” said mission team leader Mehmet Ceyhan, Technical Lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section. “We observed strong and dedicated teams in each of the key organizations that will help to achieve the government’s objectives for the PNPP.”",
            "The team also made recommendations aimed at assisting Poland in making further progress in the development of its nuclear infrastructure and its readiness to build its first NPP. The team highlighted areas where further actions would benefit Poland, including the need to further review its legal and regulatory framework, and finalise the preparatory work required for the contracting and construction stages.",
            "“Poland's cooperation with the IAEA is a long-term collaboration, and the review mission is extremely valuable and beneficial for the implementation and execution of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We would like to thank the Agency's experts for their commitment, professionalism and valuable opinions provided during the Phase 2 INIR mission. The conclusions we drew after talks with the Agency's experts will allow us to improve the implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme,” said Miłosz Motyka, Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland.",
            "Based on the outcomes of the INIR mission, the IAEA and Poland will update their Integrated Workplan to continue providing coordinated support in line with the future development of the country's nuclear power programme. In September 2023, Poland had also hosted an IAEA Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission, which found that Poland’s nuclear regulatory framework is in line with IAEA safety standards and that its regulatory body is competent and prepared for the launch of the country’s nuclear power programme.",
            "The first INIR mission took place in 2013, as a result of which good practices, existing gaps and actions necessary to remove them were identified. The recommendations and suggestions contained in the INIR mission report were used by Poland to develop the National Action Plan to address the identified shortcomings. In 2016, an INIR-Follow Up complementary mission took place, which found that all recommendations and suggestions arising from the first mission had been implemented.",
            "In December 2022, Poland applied to the IAEA with an official request to conduct an Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review for the next phase of the nuclear programme, following the adoption in November 2022 of resolutions of the Council of Ministers regarding the choice of technology for the first Polish NPP.",

            "Vogtle 3&4 are both 1,117 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 pressurised water reactors (PWRs). Unit 3 began commercial operation in July 2023. The two units were originally expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the project; Oglethorpe Power Corp owns 30%; the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) owns 22.7%; and the city of Dalton owns 1.6%. The units are operated by Southern Nuclear.",
            "The Vogtle site already hosts to two operating pressurised water reactors. With all four units now in operation, Georgia Power says Plant Vogtle is the largest generator of clean energy in the US, expected to produce more than 30 GWh of electricity each year. Nuclear energy in 2023, provided more than 25% of Georgia Power's generation, including Plant Vogtle and Plant Hatch in Baxley, Georgia.",
            "“The new Vogtle units are a key piece of our strategy to meet the energy needs of our customers not only tomorrow, but 20 years from now,” said Kim Greene, Georgia Power Chairman, President & CEO. “I’m also so proud of the teams who have worked tirelessly to deliver the first newly constructed nuclear units in the U.S. in more than 30 years – representing a long-term investment that will benefit our customers and the state of Georgia for decades to come.”",
            "In addition to the 800 permanent jobs created by the new units, the site employed more than 9,000 onsite jobs at the peak of construction including engineers, welders, electricians, pipefitters, plumbers and many more, Georgia Power noted.

            "Patrick Fragman, President & CEO of Westinghouse Electric Company, accompanied by Petro Kotin, head of Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom, paid a working visit to Khmelnitsky NPP. They conducted an inspection of stored fresh Westinghouse fuel, which was delivered to Khmelnitsky for the first time. Khmelnitsky was the last of Ukraine’s NPPs to switch to Westinghouse fuel.",
            "Half of Ukraine’s energy is generated by its NPPs. Ukraine operates seven VVER-1000 reactors, including three at South Ukraine NPP, as well as two at Rivne NPP and the two at Khmelnitsky. Rivne NPP also operates two VVER-440 reactors. Six VVER-1000 units at the Zaporizhia NPP have been under Russian control since early March 2022. While all Ukraine’s operating reactors are of Soviet design, they now use nuclear fuel from the US.",
            "Kotin said Khmelnitsky “is our last station to receive Westinghouse fuel”. He added: “Our company is very satisfied with the operational experience, its reliability, and we continue our fruitful cooperation with Westinghouse. All logistics of deliveries are reliably provided and are carried out on schedule.\" Fragman commented that both companies have been working for several years to localise fuel production in Ukraine.",
            "Kotin noted that Westinghouse, together with Ukrainian specialists, had also produced fuel for VVER-440 reactors in record time, adding that joint work continues on the development of the fuel production line. \"We will have two sources of fuel supply for our reactors – either American or Ukrainian, manufactured using Westinghouse technology.\"",
            "During the visit, Kotin and Fragman also reviewed the progress of work at the partially completed units 3&4 at the site. Khmelnitsky's first reactor was connected to the grid in 1987, but work on three others stopped in 1990 when unit 3 was 75% complete. Work on the second reactor restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004 but units 3&4 remain unfinished. Reactors currently stored at Bulgaria’s cancelled Belene NPP are expected to be used to complete these units.",
            "Kotin said the builders are working according to schedule and in June will be ready for installation of equipment. \"The draft law on completion of the units has already been submitted to the Parliament. As soon as it is accepted, the following day we will start installing the equipment,\" he added. However, talks with Bulgaria on the VVER-1000 Belene reactors are still ongoing, with no date for delivery agreed.",
            "He thanked Westinghouse for its support and assistance in completing the two units. Fragman responded noting that Westinghouse is carrying out a number of works that will increase the safe operation of the units. “We are already conducting a certain amount of research for both existing power units and those that are being completed, which complement the know-how of Energoatom.”",
            "Westinghouse is supplying its AP1000 technology for two more units at Khmelnitsky – units 5&6 – but has no experience on the construction of VVER reactors, Fragman said Westinghouse supports Energoatom’s efforts “in areas where our experience and expertise can be particularly useful for Ukraine”. He added: “Of course, this is not the same role as with units 5&6 where we are technology developers, but I can say for sure: in some aspects, we provide assistance to Energoatom.\"",
            "Fragman and Kotin also visited the site where four modular houses will soon be placed for workers from the Zaporizhia NPP who will participate in the construction of new AP1000 power units using Westinghouse technology and the completion of Units 3 and 4. The modular town will cover 3.1 hectares and become a temporary home for 242 families.",
            "\"Most of these people are the personnel of Zaporizhia NPP (ZNPP), who were forced to leave the station due to the occupation. We will move quickly, and in about a month the first builders of power units will come here,\" Kotin said. Most of the workers at ZNPP remained at the plant and signed new contracts with Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom, which now operates the facility.",
            "Kotin said this project will be implemented with the support of the Government of Sweden. Fragman noted that the construction of new power units involves not only attracting personnel, but also creating comfortable living conditions. \"The whole project for the construction of new power units is a small piece of the mosaic for the implementation of various measures. This includes the preparation of the site, the purchase of equipment, and technological work, as well as the placement and training of personnel.” He added: “Energoatom is making a lot of efforts to implement this project, and we are very happy that we can help the company in this.\"",

The site is well known for its first reactor, the Experimental Breeder Reactor-I (EBR-I), which started operations in December 1951. EBR-I was the first nuclear reactor to produce usable amounts of electricity. The reactor was also novel in that it used a liquid metal coolant and operated using a fast neutron spectrum that enabled demonstration of nuclear fuel breeding, a key concept for maximizing uranium resource use. Over the ensuing decades, 52 reactors were operated on the site establishing the technical and scientific basis that underpins the safe operation of our current commercial reactors as well as for the development of future advanced reactor concepts.

            "The CA01 super module has been installed at unit 1 of the Lianjiang NPP in China’s Guangdong Province, according to the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute (SNERDI). The 1,066-tonne concrete and steel CA01, which houses the main components of the power unit, is 27 metes long, 29 metres wide and 24 metres in height. It consists of 47 cells in which the reactor vessel, steam generators and other components of the power unit will be located. As such large components cannot be transported using available modes of transport, it was assembled at the plant site. Lifting the module into place took 3 hours and 18 minutes. In November 2023, another large module, the CA20 was installed at this unit.",
            "With a total investment of CNY130bn ($18.1bn), Lianjiang NPP is designed to have six CAP1000 pressurised water reactors, the first of which is scheduled to be operational in 2028. Phase 1 will comprise two units. Lianjiang is expected to run in conjunction with hydrogen plants and power storage stations in the area as part of an integrated energy base. It will be China’s first NPP to have a recirculating seawater cooling system super-large cooling towers.",
            "Construction of the first two 1250 MWe CAP1000 reactors – the Chinese version of the Westinghouse AP1000 – at the Lianjiang site was approved by China's State Council in September 2022. Excavation works for the units began in the same month, with the pouring of first concrete for the foundation of unit 1 completed at the end of September 2023. Lianjiang unit 1 is expected to be completed and put into operation in 2028.",

        "text": [
            "Bulgaria’s Nuclear Regulatory Agency (AYaR – Agentsiyata za Yadreno Regulirane) has licensed the use of Westinghouse fuel for unit 5 of the Kozloduy NPP. Loading of the new fuel, which has already been delivered to the site, will begin during the next scheduled repair and maintenance outage, due to begin at the end of April. The first 42 cartridges of the new American fuel arrived at Kozloduy NPP by ship from Sweden, where they were manufactured.",
            "The permit is for a step-by-step transition to the new Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assembly RWFA fuel from the Russian TVEL fuel which is currently used in both Kozloduy VVER-1000 reactor units (5&6). An earlier permit was issued in January for storage of the fuel at the site. The process of partial refuelling and parallel operation of both fuels will continue for four years. Only a quarter of fresh nuclear fuel will be replaced during the coming four fuel campaigns.",
            "The issued permit contains a number of conditions related to the transition to the new type of nuclear fuel. They include requirements as to make changes to existing instructions and documents defining new fuel operation, and for the periodic provision of additional information as well as analyses of its performance.",
            "More than 75 fuel reports and operational documents modified by the NPP to meet safety requirements and standards were reviewed in the licensing process. Requests for additional information needed to demonstrate compliance with the safety requirements resulted in more than 40 amended documents being presented for review, as well as new reports related to RWFA fuel safety.",
            "Bulgaria's Energy Minister Vladimir Malinov, who visited the plant together with caretaker Premier Dimitar Glavchev at the time of the RWFA fuel delivery, noted that a fuel diversification contract had also been signed with the French company Framatome for unit 6. Glavchev recalled that diversification is a long process, noting that he had personally participated in talks with Westinghouse in 2009-2010.",
            "In March, Bulgaria’s National Assembly (Parliament) ratified the intergovernmental agreement on cooperation in nuclear energy, signed in February between Bulgaria and the US. In January, the Bulgarian government approved a draft agreement with the US on cooperation in the construction of two new nuclear reactors using Westinghouse AP1000 technology at the Kozloduy NPP (units 7&8).",
            "After it was signed in February, Bulgaria’s Parliamentary Energy Commission said South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C), part of Hyundai Corporation, will be invited to submit a binding offer with a price for the design, construction, supply, installation and commissioning of units 7&8. Of the five candidates interested in building the new nuclear facilities, two Chinese and two American companies did not meet the requirements, he said. Bulgaria plans to launch unit 7 by 2034 and unit 8 in two to three years later. The estimated cost of construction is some $14bn, although some experts have said it could increase to $30bn.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades. Plans to build a new NPP at Belene comprising two VVER-1000 reactors was cancelled in face of political and financial difficulties after the equipment was manufactured and supplied by Russia. Those reactors, now in storage at Belene, may be transferred to Ukraine for use at the Khmelnitsky NPP pending an agreement on costs.",

This new development marks a significant milestone in the Group's ongoing expansion strategy and cements its position as the premier subcontract manufacturing business in the UK.",
            "The new division, WEC Heavy Machining & Nuclear Fabrication aims to become one of the largest subcontract machining facilities in Europe. Located adjacent to the company's existing WEC Machining facility as well as the Group’s recently inaugurated Apprentice Academy, this new purpose-built development “will support the UK's industrial capabilities in key sectors such as nuclear, defence, offshore, and general engineering”.",
            "Steve Fitzpatrick, CEO of Machining at WEC Group said the £10m ($12.4m) investment in WEC Heavy Machining & Nuclear Fabrication “underscores our ongoing commitment to adding value to our customers’ supply chains and this consolidates our position in the UK’s number 1 subcontract manufacturing company\". He added: \"With this new facility, we are not only expanding our capacity but also enhancing our overall ability to deliver turnkey solutions for large and oversized projects.\"",
            "The facility will be equipped with six large CNC machining centres, capable of handling components up to 20 metres in length and 5 metres in diameter, significantly expanding the Group’s existing capabilities, already in place within the group’s existing Blackburn and Darwen facilities.",

He added that the plans for Khmelnitsky were Ukraine’s most significant modernisation project since World War II. Also attending the ceremony were Petro Kotin, head of Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom; US Ambassador to Ukraine, Bridget Brink; and Westinghouse CEO Patrick Fragman.",
            "The first unit would be on an “accelerated schedule”, said Fragman because Ukraine has agreed to buy heavy equipment that is ready to install. Energoatom said construction of one reactor in peacetime takes five years and with an estimated cost of more than $5bn. US Exim Bank will partly finance the project.",
            "The two US-designed AP-1000 reactors will use Westinghouse technology while two new, Soviet-designed VVER-1000 units will be constructed using Russian-made equipment imported from Bulgaria’s cancelled Belene project. Kotin said when all six reactors are operational, the Khmelnitsky NPP will become Europe’s largest plant. Units 1&2 at the plant are VVER-1000 reactors.",
            "Half of Ukraine’s energy is generated by its NPPs. Ukraine operates seven VVER-1000 reactors, including three at South Ukraine NPP, as well as two at Rivne NPP and the two at Khmelnitsky. Rivne NPP also operates two VVER-440 reactors. Six VVER-1000 units at the Zaporizhia NPP have been under Russian control since early March 2022. While all Ukraine’s operating reactors are of Soviet design, they are currently using nuclear fuel from the US.",
            "\"Westinghouse is our reliable strategic partner: in the development and loading of alternative fuel into VVER reactors, in the creation of a fuel production line in Ukraine, and in the construction of new power units using Westinghouse AP1000 technology,” said Kotin.",
            "\"With this event, we are opening a new stage, a new milestone in cooperation between Westinghouse and Energoatom,” said Fragman. The units that will be built here at the Khmelnitsky NPP are identical to two twin units that were recently put into operation in the state of Georgia in the United States…. This project will also create many jobs during construction, operation, repair and maintenance.”",
            "US Ambassador Bridget Brink said: \"I welcome the efforts and desire of the Government of Ukraine and the Ministry of Energy, Energoatom in the direction of the development of nuclear power industry. These units at the Khmelnitsky NPP will be the first of nine using AP1000 technology, which are planned to be built in Ukraine together with Westinghouse.\"",
            "Khmelnitsky's first reactor was connected to the grid in 1987, but work on three others stopped in 1990 when unit 3 was 75% complete. Work on the second reactor restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004 but units 3&4 remain unfinished. Reactors currently stored at Bulgaria’s cancelled Belene NPP are expected to be used to complete these units. However, talks with Bulgaria are still ongoing. Halushchenko said earlier this year that unit 3 could begin operation in as little as two and a half years, but no firm timeline has been established for any of the new reactors.",
            "Earlier it was reported that the two planned AP1000 units (5&6) would use reactors currently in storage in the US. Energoatom said in December that “quite favourable conditions were obtained for the supply of equipment, which is already manufactured and ready for delivery”. The equipment had been manufactured for two new units at the US VC Summer NPP being built in South Carolina before the project was cancelled in the wake of Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy."

Westinghouse said this is a result of ongoing engagement with local suppliers following the Westinghouse Supplier Symposium held in February with Bulgarian companies.",
            "The MOUs outline the potential for manufacturing key components, including large structural modules, cranes, heat exchangers and pressure vessels, as well as providing various engineering, transportation, consulting and construction services. The suppliers include Atomenergoremont JSC; Bulmachinery Enterprises Ltd; Bureau Veritas Bulgaria; Centralna Energoremontna Baza EAD; ELIA AD; Energoremont-Galabovo AD; Himmash JSC; Industrial Parts; KMC JSC; Kranostroene Engineering; MTG-Dolphin; PODEMCRANE AD; Tia Logistics; TM INOX; Biomashinostroene AD; Bularmex-IK JSCo; and Micromet AD.",
            "“Ensuring high localisation of work on the AP1000 project at Kozloduy remains a crucial objective,” said Petyo Ivanov, Executive Director of Kozloduy NPP New Build Company. “We celebrate today’s announcement and these impressive local suppliers, whose partnerships represent another step toward bringing additional advanced, nuclear technology online in Bulgaria and emphasise the economic impact that the project will have for our country and its people. We expect these Bulgarian companies to become a vital part of the Westinghouse worldwide supply chain, more specifically for all their European new build projects.”",
            "David Durham, President of Westinghouse Energy Systems said: “Westinghouse has a robust supply chain network across the world, and we are pleased to further expand that with additional, experienced and local Bulgarian suppliers to support the successful delivery of two AP1000 reactors at the Kozloduy site.” He added: “Growth of our local and qualified supplier network in addition to the critical progress we are making on our front-end engineering and design contract for this project are important steps that help us to pave the way to bring a clean energy future to Bulgaria for generations to come.”",

            "Czech power company ČEZ reported that unit 3 at the Dukovany NPP for the first time had achieved a heat output of 1,475 MWt, which is 2.3% more than before and corresponds to an output of 511 MWe under optimal climatic conditions. The increase, which the power engineers achieved safely without any increase in fuel consumption or emissions, corresponds, for example, to three times the power of the hydroelectric power plant at the foot of the Brno dam. As a result, the annual production of the Dukovany NPP should increase by approximately 300,000 MWh next year after modifications to all four units.",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. Initially, the output of the Dukovany units corresponded to their original designation – 440 MWe. However, 15 years ago, energy companies managed to increase the installed capacity of each of them to 500 MWe through upgrades and the use of reserves. A similar process took place in Temelín, where the power of both units increased from 981 MWe to the current 1,086 MWe.",
            "“Through the modernisation of our nuclear power plants, we have figuratively managed to build a large coal-fired power plant or a smaller nuclear unit,” said ČEZ Board Chairman & CEO Daniel Beneš. “The current increase in performance in Dukovany is part of this trend. Of course, the absolute priority is safety, we would never have taken such a step without confirming the safety parameters.”",
            "The increase in the power of Dukovany 3 was preceded by several years of preparation consisting of detailed calculations and analyses of safety parameters as well as modernisation of technological and safety systems. The current type of fuel is used for operation at increased power. Increasing power means greater heat output of the reactor. The water temperature at the reactor outlet increased by about 2 °C from 298.4 to 300.4 °C.",
            "“Seemingly small parameter changes will bring us hundreds of thousands of megawatts of electricity a year,” explained Bohdan Zronek Board member and Director of the Nuclear Energy Division at ČEZ. “Preparation for high-performance operations required confirmation of safety analyses, but no large-scale investments were required.",
            "Preparations began in 2020 as part of the programme Utilisation of the Potential of the Dukovany NPP. It also included a project, which since 2023 has ensured the transition from an 11-month fuel cycle to a 16-month fuel cycle and the introduction of a new generation of fuel to improve fuel efficiency.",
            "Dukovany NPP Director Roman Havlín said during 2024 similar work would take place at units 1&2. “If we pass all the tests successfully, we would like to increase production by approximately 300,000 MW from next year. But we still have a number of tasks ahead of us,” he noted. Last year unit 4 began using new generation PK3+ fuel supplied by Russia’s TVEL. The new assemblies are designed to make the use of uranium in the fuel more efficient.",
            "TVEL (part of Rosatom) has long been the fuel supplier for both Temelin and Dukovany but from 2024 US-based Westinghouse and the French Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel, which is now being tested at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP. Currently Dukovany has TVEL fuel for several years.",
            "It remains to be seen how fuel from other suppliers will affect plant efficiency. Havlin commented earlier: \"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know.\"",

            "UK nuclear trade association, the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) has applied for a justification decision for newcleo’s lead-cooled fast reactor design, the LFR-AS-200. The application makes the case that the benefits of clean, firm, flexible power from the LFR-AS-200 would far outweigh any potential risks. NIA says these are” rigorously controlled by robust safety features, including passive safety systems, built into the design and incorporated into the operating arrangements, in line with the UK’s regulatory requirements”.",
            "The application also argues that the reactor design would support nuclear energy’s contribution to a stable and well-balanced electricity grid, which is essential to reduce consumer bills and maintain economic competitiveness.",
            "Justification is a regulatory process which requires a government decision before any new class or type of practice involving ionising radiation can be introduced in the UK. A justification decision is one of the required steps for the operation of a new nuclear technology in the UK, but it is not a permit or licence that allows a specific project to go ahead. It is a generic decision based on a high-level evaluation of the potential benefits and detriments of the proposed new nuclear practice as a pre-cursor to future regulatory processes.",
            "This is the first ever application for justification of an advanced nuclear technology in the UK. The government has confirmed that the application has been accepted for consideration, and the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) will support the Secretary of State in their role as the justifying authority responsible for the justification decision.",
            "NIA CEO Tom Greatrex said advanced reactors such as newcleo’s design “have enormous potential to support the UK’s energy security and net zero transition, so we were delighted to apply for this decision”. He added: “This is an opportunity for the UK Government to demonstrate that it backs advanced nuclear technologies to support a robust clean power mix and to reinvigorate the UK’s proud tradition of nuclear innovation. We look forward to engaging with the Government and the public throughout this process and to further applications for new nuclear designs in the future.”",
            "Stefano Buono, newcleo CEO said this was “an important milestone in our development programme and a vital step forward in our delivery plan for the UK”. He added: “We continue to progress our UK plans at pace – aiming to deliver our first of a kind commercial reactor in the UK by 2033. We are but one player in the new nuclear renaissance and we look forward to working with government and the rest of the sector to develop the robust supply chain that can deliver the UK’s ambition of 24GW of nuclear power by 2050.”",
            "The Justification of Practices Involving Ionising Radiation Regulations 2004 require that any new practice that produces ionising radiation is justified by an evaluation of the potential benefits and the potential detriments. Defra will now conduct a process of internal review and consultation with a number of statutory consultees. NIA previously applied for justification decisions for the Advanced Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR) designed by Hitachi, the Advanced Passive 1000 (AP1000) reactor designed by Westinghouse and the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR) designed by AREVA (now Framatome).",

This is why we are designing two Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), enabling plant manufacturing and reducing costs: they are 30MWe and 200MWe, a relatively small power compared to conventional nuclear power plants (1000MWe average). The 30MWe can swiftly meet the commercial demand for small electric generating units, such as for islands, remote communities, or to power large vessels (shipping propulsion). The 200MWe can be an economically competitive solution for central station power plants.",

            "Zeolites were placed into the FGMSP in the 1970s and 80s to help absorb radiation and make the facility safer for personnel. Now they need to be removed as part of the pond clean-up programme. There are another 236 such skips to be removed accounting for a quarter of the total in the pond.",
            "The FGMSP was constructed in the 1950s to store, cool and prepare used Magnox nuclear fuel for recycling into new fuel. During its 26-year operating lifetime it processed approximately 27,000 tonnes of fuel – almost 2.5m fuel rods. Used nuclear fuel from the UK's nine Magnox stations, along with Magnox fuel from both Italy and Japan was held in the FGMSP.",
            "Currently the pond holds some 14,000 cubic metres of contaminated water, in which is stored Magnox used nuclear fuel, radioactive sludge, miscellaneous nuclear wastes and skips. The plan is to progressively retrieve and treat the radiological inventory, reducing the risk posed by its storage and the inherent hazard posed by the materials. The FGMSP has been prioritised for clean-up by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA).",
            "Carl Carruthers, head of legacy ponds for Sellafield Ltd, said this was a fantastic achievement and a real step forward. “Removing zeolite skips from the pond and transferring them to safer storage reduces risk and hazard on the site.It also frees up space in the pond which makes our sludge removal and clean-up work easier.”",
            "The 29-tonne self-shielded boxes are built in the UK by Goodwin International via a contract with Westinghouse. Once waste is placed inside it is checked regularly using remote cameras in the box lid. Eventually, the Zeolites will be removed from the boxes and encapsulated, ready for the consignment to the UK’s Geological Disposal Facility.",

Prodigy says the facility would require minimal site preparation compared with a site-constructed small modular reactor (SMR). The TNPP would arrive at site more ready for final commissioning meaning power generation could start within weeks. At the end of project life, the TNPP would be removed for decommissioning, eliminating legacy waste.",

            "“Ensuring a secure, carbon-free, and affordable electricity and heat supply for all of Canada is crucial, and SMRs will play a significant role,” said Sean Willy, President & CEO, Des Nëdhé Group. “TNPP technologies address many of the upfront concerns that Indigenous groups have when considering a potential SMR project. This includes minimising the environmental impact and reducing the project life cycle complexity and cost, when compared to a traditional site-constructed SMR. The end use opportunity for TNPPs across remote industrial and residential power in Canada is very significant.”",

            "During each outage when tubes are inspected or plugged, a condition monitoring and operational assessment is conducted to confirm that the structural and leakage integrity performance criteria have been satisfied.",
            "The objective of the inspections is to ensure that the components continue to function consistently with the design and current licensing basis of the facility. These inspections, based on the plant’s technical standards, are performance-based, and the actual scope of the inspections and the expansion of sample inspections are justified based on the results of previous inspections. If degradation or evidence of degradation is detected, then more detailed inspections or evaluations are to be performed.",
            "The programme procedures reflect these requirements and outline the inspection programme to detect degradation of tubes, plugs, and secondary side internals, as well as providing inspection frequencies. The inspections and monitoring are performed by qualified personnel using qualified techniques. A so-called Primary-to-Secondary Leakage Monitoring Program is a further potential indicator of a loss of steam generator tube integrity.",
            "A condition monitoring assessment is performed at the conclusion of each inspection to determine whether inspection criteria is met. An operational assessment, which is a forward-looking evaluation, is used to determine whether the structural integrity and accident leakage performance will be acceptable during the operating interval until the next in-service inspection.",
            "Degradation of divider plate assemblies, tube-to-tubesheet welds, heads (internal surfaces), or tubesheets (primary side) may have safety implications. Therefore, all of these components and the steam generator tubes, plugs, and secondary side components are included in the asset management programme.",
            "The steam generators at Diablo Canyon – four in each unit – were replaced with Westinghouse Delta 54 models, which contain Alloy 690 thermally treated tubes. The replacement took place in 2008 for Unit 2 and 2009 for Unit 1. The tubing and secondary internals in these units are more resistant to corrosion. There have been no reported instances of cracking in thermally treated Alloy 690 tubes at any plant in the USA. All degradation indications to date are from wear (fretting) due to loose parts, tube supports or anti-vibration bars, or from manufacturing or handling anomalies. A690TT was used as the tubing material for some initial replacement steam generators and some original steam generators in the USA.",
            "An NRC information note, Experiences During Recent Steam Generator Inspections, addressed the importance of recognising potential degradation in new areas and of assessing the significance of indications. At Diablo Canyon the assessment evaluates industry experience as well as that at the plant itself to identify active, relevant and potential tube damage mechanisms. Some of the important features of the Degradation Assessment include choosing techniques to test for degradation based on the probability of detection and sizing capability, establishing the structural limits, and establishing the flaw growth rate or a plan to establish the flaw growth rate.",
            "The licence renewal application details operating experience at several reactors.",
            "In 2012 indications related to cracking were found at dents/dings and in the freespan region in A600TT tube at Seabrook 1. In 2012 bobbin coil inspections and a further inspection using a rotating probe with a +Point",
            "coil confirmed the presence of axially oriented outside diameter stress corrosion cracking (ODSCC) in several areas around dents and dings. Seabrook revised its inspection scope to include 100% of dings and dents with bobbin voltage amplitudes greater than 5 volts and 20% of those with bobbin amplitudes of greater than 2 volts. Tubes with axially oriented ODSCC were removed from service by plugging both tube ends.",
            "In 2012 at Braidwood 2 a tube in the Westinghouse Model D5 steam generators was found to have three indications of axially oriented ODSCC, two at tube support plate elevations and one in the freespan area between two support plates at a ding in the tubing. The tube was plugged at both ends. Reanalysing bobbin coil data found no additional crack-like indications.",
            "In 2009 at Surry 1, an indication of axial primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) was found at the hot-leg expansion transition (top-of tubesheet) in one steam generator with A600TT tubing. Further examination at all three steam generators at Surry 1 found no other indications of PWSCC. After an in-situ pressure test the tube was removed from service.",
            "A review of Diablo Canyon operating experience revealed no instances of degradation similar to those at Seabrook, Braidwood and Surry. At the plant Bobbin coil inspections are conducted tube end to tube end, with +Point",
            "probe inspections completed for areas of interest (as determined during bobbin coil inspection).",
            "In 2012, the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS) identified significant anti-vibration bar and tube-to-tube wear in replacement steam generators. This is an industry anomaly for units operating with A690TT tubing. The wear discovered at SONGS 2 and 3 was caused by in-plane fluid elastic instability. It is not considered relevant for Diablo Canyon’s replacement steam generators as they have already operated for multiple fuel cycles without similar degradation and the steam generators have a different design.",
            "A review of operating experience over the 10 years to 2023 has not revealed any instances of severe degradation at Diablo Canyon. Eddy current testing during refuelling outages revealed a few instances of AVB wear and a small number of tubes have been plugged, but in no instance were the condition monitoring limits exceeded, so performance criteria was satisfied.",
            "Given this evidence, the condition of steam generators at Diablo Canyon are not expected to impede an decision on life extension to Unit 1’s operating licence out to November 2044, and Unit 2 through to August 2045."

The SMR-300 is a pressurised water reactor (PWR) using technology based on existing standards in the US and UK and uses PWR fuel similar to that already used at Sizewell B, and other new UK reactors under development including Hinkley Point C. Holtec has been developing its SMR since 2011. The SMR-300 has undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "In December 2023, Holtec Britain was awarded £30m ($37.6m) of grant funding from the UK government’s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to complete Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of the SMR-300, which was also shortlisted by Great British Nuclear (GBN) at the end of October 2023. The other five short-listed companies are Rolls Royce SMR, EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. If successful in the Great British Nuclear SMR competition, Holtec plans to establish a factory in the UK to build the major mechanical SMR components and support other aligned manufacturing needs in clean energy and defence sectors.",
            "Holtec says an exercise to find the best location for a factory will be launched in the coming weeks. If established, the factory will support deployment of 5 GW of on-grid UK electricity from SMR-300 by 2050 and create a major export hub. Holtec Britain’s Senior Advisor, Professor Dame Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge stated, “Holtec is committed to delivering SMRs in the UK creating high-value well-paid jobs and providing clean energy to help us reach net zero. This agreement is another important step on this journey.”",

            "As part of his recent UK budget statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “I can announce that this week the government has reached agreement on a £160m ($203m) deal with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site in Ynys Môn and the Oldbury site in South Gloucestershire.” This was confirmed in paragraph 5.120 of the Budget Statement. Hunt said the purchase had been made \"given the importance of securing nuclear sites for the success of the nuclear programme\".",
            "In January 2021, Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power notified the UK Planning Inspectorate that it was withdrawing its application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey where it had planned to construct a nuclear power plant with two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors. The £20bn project had been expected to provide employment and business opportunities for the region.",
            "Hitachi had announced the suspension of the project in January 2019 and its intent to withdraw entirely in September 2020. In light of this, and in the absence of a new funding policy from HM Government, Hitachi decided to wind-up Horizon as an active development entity by 31 March 2021. Hitachi continued to manage the site under the control of its subsidiary Hitachi Europe Limited. \"This will be done with a view to considering development proposals from commercial or public sector developers who may come forward, and Horizon will continue to support this intent until the end of March,” said Horizon CEO Duncan Hawthorne. “Beyond this period Hitachi Europe will remain available to respond to any parties who may have an interest in acquiring these sites.\"",
            "In his budget speech, Hunt added that, as well as seeking a site for a new large-scale NPP, \"the government is now moving to the next stage of the SMR process, with six companies invited to submit their initial tender responses by June this year\". He added that \"no decisions have been taken on projects\". The government earlier outlined plans to increase nuclear energy capacity to 24 GWe by 2050, with a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of that strategy. In 2023, the government and the new Great British Nuclear (GNB) arms-length body set up to help deliver extra nuclear capacity began the selection process for a suitable SMR technology. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of that process.",

        "text": [
            "Above: The basic assembly design of uranium oxide fuel pellets clad with zirconium alloy tubing has remained the fuel of choice for the vast majority of commercial nuclear power plants",
            "There is a growing interest worldwide in the development and deployment of accident tolerant fuels (ATFs). Accident tolerant fuels are included in a wider generic group of Advanced Technology Fuels. ATFs are seen to offer both safety and economic benefits for nuclear power reactors with many designs under consideration. They can be defined as fuels:",
            "That have potential to enhance the safety in case of a severe accident in a reactor core for a longer time than the current UO2-zirconium alloy fuel system",
            "That can maintain or improve fuel performance during normal operation and operational transients",
            "That are compatible with all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle (transport, storage, and possible use within a closed fuel cycle)",
            "ATFs mostly involve new cladding and fuel pellet designs that increase the performance and severe accident response times of nuclear fuel. They take advantage of new materials that reduce hydrogen build-up, improve fission production retention, and are structurally more resistant to radiation, corrosion, and higher temperatures. In addition, they are expected to last longer than current fuel designs and may extend the time between refuellings from 1.5 to 2 years for pressurised water reactors. This would reduce the amount of fuel assemblies needed, leading to less waste production and a reduction in fuel costs.",
            "Those technologies that are mature enough to start fuel qualification and achieve near-term deployment – within the coming decade in the existing fleet of light water reactors (LWRs) and in the LWR-based small modular reactor (SMR) designs – are termed “evolutionary accident tolerant fuels (eATFs)”. There are numerous designs and concepts that could be termed as eATFs, based on features such as enhanced cladding, modified uranium oxide fuel (including dopants), and increased enrichment.",
            "A great deal of research and development has been undertaken to support the introduction of eATFs into commercial nuclear power reactors, with the first eATFs entering service in 2021 as part of a number of test programmes. These tests support the economic and safety cases for reactor core operations and provide preliminary information to anticipate potential impacts on the back end of the fuel cycle when compared with traditional power reactor fuels. This includes during storage, transportation, reprocessing and recycling, and disposal.",
            "Nuclear fuel has been subject to continuous development over the past 40 years and has reached a stage where it can be safely and reliably irradiated up to 65 GWd/tU in commercial nuclear reactors. During this time, there have been many improvements to the original designs and materials, but the basic design of uranium oxide (UO2) fuel pellets clad with zirconium (Zr) alloy tubing has remained the fuel of choice for the vast majority of commercial nuclear power plants. However, severe accidents, such as those at the Three Mile Island plant in 1979 in the US and at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi NPP in 2011 showed that, under extreme conditions, nuclear fuel will fail. Under certain circumstances, high temperature reactions between zirconium alloys and water will lead to the generation of hydrogen, with the potential for explosions to occur.",
            "During the earthquake and tsunami that seriously damaged the Fukushima Daiichi plant in 2011, the reactors shut down immediately but fission products in the fuel continued to release decay heat. Zirconium alloys in the cladding of the fuel assemblies oxidise rapidly at temperatures a few hundred degrees higher than normal operating temperatures, leading to disintegration of the fuel rods and rapid corrosion of the cladding. This process released hydrogen causing explosions that further damaged the plant.",
            "This disaster prompted researchers to begin developing accident-tolerant fuel solutions which would allow more time before active cooling is required in a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) or, even better, would be able to indefinitely withstand the sustained high temperatures created by decay heat and insufficient cooling, thus preventing or delaying the release of radionuclides during an accident.",
            "Research, focused mainly on the design of fuel pellets and cladding, as well as interactions between the two, almost immediately got under way in key nuclear countries such as the USA, Russia, France the UK, South Korea, Japan and China. This research has been supported by international bodies such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).",
            "The IAEA has been supporting international co-operation among member states in fuel development since the 1980s, long before the Fukushima accident. This included efforts to enhance the capacities of computer codes used for predicting fuel behaviour, within the framework of Coordinated Research Projects (CRPs). However, the Fukushima accident demonstrated the need for adequate analysis of all aspects of fuel performance to prevent a failure and to predict fuel behaviour in accidents, as well as the need to test and model the behaviours of ATFs.",
            "The IAEA works through technical meetings, consultancy meetings, conferences, and CRP activity. Two CRPs were organised in the wake of Fukushima to focus on the modelling and testing of nuclear fuels and ATFs in design basis and severe accidents.",
            "The first CRP on “FUel Modelling in Accident Conditions (FUMAC)” (2014-2018) sought to better understand fuel behaviour in accident conditions by identifying best practices in the application of relevant physical models and computer codes, used by different member states, and the enhancement of their predictive capacities. Well checked results of accident simulation experiments and their analyses with advanced fuel performance codes were carried out in the CRP and the results published in an IAEA technical document in 2019.",
            "The second CRP on “Analysis of Options and Experimental Examination of Fuels with Increased Accident Tolerance (ACTOF)” (2015-2019) dealt with the acquisition of data through experiments on advanced technology fuel types and cladding materials. It also looked at development of modelling capacity to predict the behaviour of the components and the integral performance of ATF designs under normal and transient conditions and sought to demonstrate improvements under severe accident conditions. These results were published in an IAEA technical document in 2020.",
            "Based on recommendation of an IAEA Technical Meeting (TM) on Modelling of Fuel Behaviour in Design Basis Accidents and Design Extension Conditions in May 2019, a new CRP on Testing and Simulations of ATF was launched in 2021 and is ongoing. It includes a set of experiments with some participants providing samples to several laboratories. The experiments then provide data on a new set of ATFs. The results will be available in 2024.",
            "This CRP aims to address factors affecting the design, fabrication and in-pile behaviour of currently operating and innovative nuclear fuels and materials for power reactors, and to increase technology readiness. Objectives include:",
            "To perform experimental tests including single rod and bundle tests on ATFs’ performance under normal, Design Basis (DB) and Design Extension (DE) conditions",
            "To benchmark fuel codes against new test data either obtained during the CRP or from existing data relevant to advanced fuel and cladding concepts from member states’ experimental programmes",
            "To develop LOCA evaluation methodology for ATF performance with a view to NPP applications",
            "To look at part of the methodology for using ATF fuel in NPPs and to develop an open source library on the subject of ATF",
            "Dr Nicolas Waeckel a former employee of Electricité de France (EDF) who worked for many years on ATF development told NEI: “We started to work on ATF together with US DOE right after Fukushima, participating in expert groups in IAEA and OECD.” He added: “I was in charge of developing a new safety standard to qualify this new type of fuel. When you develop a new type of fuel you cannot apply current standards. You have to develop new criteria, a new way of validating the material… and maybe even changing the way of thinking about safety for a type of fuel which can be very different from current fuel.”",
            "Since 2012, the US Department of Energy (DOE) has supported the development of ATF concepts through its Enhanced Accident Tolerant Fuel (EATF) programme. DOE is currently funding research by France’s Framatome as well as GE Hitachi and Westinghouse. Russia is also currently testing its TVS-2M ATF at unit 2 of the Rostov nuclear plant.",
            "Waeckel pointed out that the DOE had received funding from Congress to develop safer fuel “so all the fuel manufacturers and the researchers worked quite hard on development”. As a result, even before Fukushima, many laboratories and manufacturers “had on their shelves in the closet some exotic fuel under development, but on standby,” he said. “However, there was no demand, no real need to put this fuel in a reactor because the current fuel was behaving quite well.”",
            "He added: “People who developed the nuclear industry 15 years ago were pretty good, and they learned a lot from their mistakes and some bad experiences so that now we have achieved very good optimisation.” That, argues Waeckel, is why the fuel concept did not change. “And now, all of a sudden, because of Fukushima, just because DOE had the great idea of saving the world, we are considering change. I think we have to be a bit more humble.”",
            "He said the driver to develop ATF used to be enhanced performance and behaviour in accidents, “but we realised that this is not really achievable in the short term”. So now the focus is on other things – cladding, fuel cycle optimisation – a longer cycle and higher burn up. “This may be of some interest to the operators… improving plant economics – that is the motor,” said Waeckel.",
            "Among the multiple variants of ATF proposed by the various fuel suppliers (see Figure 1), there are two main categories of fuel, with respect to their technology readiness level, which relates to the time and effort needed to develop, qualify, and license the concepts. These are:",
            "Short-term evolutionary concepts, for example coated Zr-based claddings; stainless steel cladding (eg FeCrAl); high density fuel (eg U3Si2), and doped fuel pellets (eg Cr doped)",
            "Longer-term revolutionary concepts, such as refractory claddings (eg lined Mo), silicon carbide (SiC) claddings; microcells fuel; micro-encapsulated fuel pellet concepts; uranium nitride fuel",
            "Key requirements for advanced fuels relate to in-reactor fuel performance, cladding performance, and compatibility with all system constraints.",
            "Waeckel stressed that developing a new type of fuel is a long-term objective in terms of its qualification. “Putting new fuel in a reactor is not like putting a new app on your telephone. If the app doesn’t work you just dump it and the phone is still safe. But if you put the wrong fuel in a reactor it could be a nightmare for everyone. So, we have to be very prudent, very careful, think about everything that could happen. No operator in the world wants to experience bad surprises.”",
            "However, this caution is not necessarily a negative thing. “For me, all this is very positive because it is motivating all the labs, all the researchers, and especially the young generation,” he said. “They see a vision for the future in developing this new type of fuel.” Some projects are very exotic and totally different from standard fuel while others are very similar – just fuel with a novel coating. Some of these evolutionary fuels are already under irradiation as part of the testing and qualification process.",
            "However, Waeckel cautioned the ultimate progress for these evolutionary fuels is limited. “What we are talking about is grace time – we are going to gain a couple of minutes. It is not a game changer. It is a small change and offers some benefit. Is it real accident tolerant fuel? Not really, but it is an improvement,” he said.",
            "Concluding, Waeckel said: “My main message is that development is always positive for the nuclear community because we are making progress in all areas – in research, in investigation techniques, in measurement techniques, in modelling, and all these improvements are beneficial for the nuclear industry as a whole,” he said, observing: “So even if the product itself is not going to be a magic answer or a magic solution, it is a platform for the young generation to think about safety, modelling, advanced modelling, advanced investigation.”",

            "US-based Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co, announced that unit 4 at the Vogtle nuclear expansion project near Waynesboro, Georgia, has been connected to the electric grid for the first time. This follows initial criticality, which was achieved in mid-February. Georgia Power said grid connection is part of ongoing start-up testing for Vogtle 4. Operators will continue to raise reactor power while performing tests at various power levels until it reaches to 100%. Once all start-up testing is completed and the unit is available for reliable dispatch, Vogtle 4 will enter commercial operation. The in-service date for Unit 4 is projected during the second quarter of 2024.",
            "Vogtle 3&4 are both 1,117 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The two units were originally expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the project; Oglethorpe Power Corp owns 30%; the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) owns 22.7%; and the city of Dalton owns 1.6%. The units will be operated by Southern Nuclear.",
            "The Vogtle site already hosts to two operating pressurised water reactors. Unit 3 – the first new nuclear unit to be built in the USA for more than three decades – reached initial criticality in March 2023, and began commercial operation the following July.",

        "text": [
            "Above: OPG is to construct a first-of-a-kind GE Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Darlington nuclear site (Photo credit: Ontario Power Generation (OPG))",
            "The latest in the long series of nuclear technology promises, that of the Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), keeps gaining potency, as illustrated by the evolution of the discourses between the 2022 and 2023 Reuters SMR and Advanced Reactor conferences. The nuclear community has been highly successful in creating a sense of urgency, in the face of climate and energy security crises, thereby lending the promise considerable legitimacy. By contrast, the road is long before the SMR promise reaches sufficient credibility – a second key success factor for any techno-scientific promise – by persuading investors and other stakeholders of the industry’s ability to deliver.",
            "The promise is facing an increasingly risky phase, as shown by the recent cancellation of the NuScale project in Idaho. The greater the expectations, the deeper is the disappointment if the hopeful discourses fail to gradually translate into policy instruments, funding schemes – and ultimately, R&D, prototype and commercial projects. Yet, the credibility and the very success of the SMR promise may matter less for a growing number of industry players and nuclear advocates who see SMRs less as an end and more as a means of getting back to the “real business” of building large reactors.",
            "Is the SMR promise legitimate?",
            "The urgency of tackling the climate change and energy security challenges has lent the SMRs the legitimacy, and hence the political support, that is vital for any techno-scientific promise. If 2022’s Atlanta conference was replete with frustration and nostalgic references to the foregone times of political leadership under the Atoms for Peace programme, last year’s motto seemed to be that the nuclear community has now won the political battle – and that “there’s no path to net zero without nuclear”. Fred Dermarkar, the President and CEO of Canada’s nuclear science and technology laboratory AECL, opened his speech with great enthusiasm: “It’s a heart-stopping historic moment!… For how long have we been asking for leadership?…Well, we have it now!” The prominent role of nuclear in the recent joint statement by PM Trudeau and President Biden on energy-sector collaboration served as a sign of political leadership. Alongside the frequent references to IEA and IPPC reports, in 2023 the speakers evoked the recent Ontario grid operator’s report, which suggests that to reach its net-zero emission target by 2050, the province could need up to 17,800 MW of new nuclear capacity, both SMRs and large reactors. Reaching the climate targets without stable nuclear baseload might be possible but extremely costly, the Atlanta speakers reasoned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the downsides of stable and rather inflexible baseload in the decentralised and renewables-dominated grids of tomorrow were not explored.",
            "Legitimacy alone is not enough, however, if the promise-makers fail to convince key stakeholders of the ability of the technology to effectively tackle the problem. The concern of the industry’s ability to deliver was even more acute in 2023 than the year before. Where to find the requisite resources and abilities to complete the SMR designs, persuade investors, rebuild supply chains, pass through the regulatory maze, and then eventually construct new reactors at the pace needed to satisfy the demand, and – according to a pledge by a group of over 20 countries at COP 28 – triple the global nuclear capacity by 2050?",
            "Historical experience of the radical downscaling of electricity growth forecasts in the mid-1970s calls for caution. Yet, if demand does indeed shootsthrough the roof, how is the SMR industry to compete with its rivals, for the needed resources, for both highly skilled and unskilled workforce?",
            "The industry question of “can we deliver?” had by 2023 surpassed the concerns for cumbersome safety regulation as an obstacle to SMR deployment. Gone were the previous year’s complaints about “too much democracy” in safety regulation, instead the regulators and government speakers now openly challenged the industry. Ramzi Jammal, Chief Regulatory Operations Officer at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), pointed out that international regulatory harmonisation was well underway, including plans to set up an International Technical Support Organization (ITSO) to assist regulators in embarking countries. Jammal had a scathing message to the industry: “You are behind us, let me tell you bluntly… Get your act together, standardise the codes and move on in that direction. Otherwise, you are going to get something you are not going to like!”. Björn Peters, the co-founder of Dual Fluid, developing a lead-cooled SMR, echoed Jammal: once the industry comes up with a truly good design, “licensing will follow, politics will follow”, but the real challenge is to “convince… in each utility the top 20 people or so to buy a few” reactors.",
            "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Julie Kozeracki made an almost desperate plea for action: “At LPO (DOE’s Loan Programs Office), I have 300 billion dollars in loans that almost nobody wants, for nuclear deployment.” With a pinch of sarcasm, Kozeracki noted that “the nuclear industry really loves press releases, they love MoUs, they love letters of intent. But I can’t finance a supply chain or build a workforce on a press release. I need signed contracts!”",
            "The SMR promise is still far from proving its credibility in the eyes of investors. Symptomatic was that Westinghouse, with its AP300, had replaced NuScale as the 2023 conference’s opening showcase. NuScale’s recent troubles – the steady decline of its share price since August 2022, the cancellation in November 2023 of its planned first-of-a-kind project in Idaho, for the lack of subscribers – illustrate the fragility of the promise of new, even light-water, reactor designs. The absence of Rolls-Royce, another posterchild from the 2022 conference, points in the same direction.",
            "But why should investors believe that this time all will be different, that the industry has learned its lessons and that SMR projects will not run vastly over time and over budget, like the recent AP1000s in the US and EPRs in Europe? By educating the finance community, answered Kalev Kallemets, director of the Estonian SMR start-up Fermi Energia. “The public has moved on, but the financing has not… in nuclear, we are living in the post-traumas. It’s important to bring that very conservative field of finance also to the 21st century.” However, the recipe based on the “deficit model” – that citizens must be educated, and thus liberated from their “irrational fears” – has not worked with the general public and is unlike to work with the finance community. A more serious initiative is the plan to establish an International Bank for Nuclear Investment (IBNI), presented in Atlanta by its chairman Daniel Dean as a “long-term partner and pro-industry, pro-market and pro-investor supporter and enabler of SMR/Gen IV stakeholders”. Crucially, IBNI would establish “a globally recognised and harmonised” set of standards and criteria for SMR technologies, thereby seeking to help scale-up and commodify SMR delivery across the world.",
            "Consultants and pro-nuclear climate activists Kirsty Gogan and Eric Ingersoll, from Terra Praxis, painted even bolder visions of scaling up via “productisation”. Their vision of a move away from cumbersome, risky, and difficult-to-finance one-off projects towards modular factory production is elemental to the SMR promise. Turning the vision into practice may be difficult. Even SMR advocates have shown scepticism towards the idea of modularity as factory production. Many prominent nuclear-sector cheerleaders on social media are equally critical.",
            "Exploiting the window of opportunity",
            "Being able to deliver is fundamental, yet the Atlanta 2023 speakers stressed that doing it fast is vital. “We must build reactors now!”, said Fred Dermarkar from the AECL, “to show that we can deliver”, not least to enable the nuclear industry to stay in the game. The creation of IBNI may help, but even there, timelines are becoming stretched, with plans to have the Bank operational by 2026. Views diverge on what the current “window of opportunity” for SMRs in fact consists of. For some, it is the growing public acceptance, spurred by climate change and energy security concerns, and the fading of the memories of the Fukushima disaster. For others, the opportunity lies in the unprecedented yet ever so fragile political demand and leadership. Many nuclear critics argue that the development of battery technologies, grid management and demand-side solutions will soon close the “window” and render SMRs uncompetitive with renewables. In contrast, and echoing the general sentiment in Atlanta, Julie Kozeracki argued that nuclear does not even need to compete with renewables but instead with “other clean, firm options” such as “solar with really long-duration storage, or natural gas with carbon capture, geothermal, or hydropower”.",
            "Instead of safety regulation, the lengthy siting procedures and impact assessments were at the 2023 conference highlighted as a major obstacle to fast delivery of SMRs. Great hopes were placed on repurposing former coal or decommissioned nuclear sites, which could help cut down the planning, assessment and site preparation time down to 4-5 years from the current 8-9 years. However, Scott Hunnewell, Vice President of the New Nuclear Program at the TVA, reminded delegates of the difficulties of repurposing, including the highly distinct requirements and conditions for coal and nuclear sites. Public acceptance cannot be taken for granted either, even in communities with populations desperate for new economic activity and familiar with risky industries.",
            "The question haunting the 2022 conference was that of leadership: who is to move first and commit to an SMR project? A year later, Canada, with supply chains in shape – largely thanks to the recent and ongoing refurbishments – had consolidated its role as a potential leader of yet another promised nuclear renaissance in the West. “The world is looking to Canada!,” exclaimed Brian Fehrenbach, Director of Business Development at the Organisation Canadian Nuclear Industries (OCNI). More accurate might be to say that all eyes are on Ontario, where OPG is to construct a first-of-a-kind GE Hitachi BWRX-300 SMR at its Darlington nuclear site, with the expected completion date of 2028. The announced timetable has not slipped, yet. Empirical evidence on costs and feasibility, based on this project, were to precede any commitment to a wider SMR programme, yet in July 2023, the Ontario provincial government jumped the gun, by confirming OPG’s plan to build three additional BWRX-300s on the same site. SaskPower is eagerly waiting for cost experience from the OPG, to decide in 2029 whether to follow suit and launch the construction of four BWRX-300s.",
            "Most of the leading SMR designs may be foreign, especially American, but the Canadian government’s commitment to nuclear is arguably stronger than ever.",
            "The policy frameworks and collaborative networks (SMR Roadmap, Action Plan, strategic plan, and feasibility study) are there, laying the basis for the three “streams” of SMR development – light-water SMRs for grid electricity, advanced designs mainly for industrial heat and power, and micro-SMRs for off-grid uses in remote communities.",
            "But have the Canadians learned from past policy failures? Has the country left behind its policy tradition that political scientists Michael Howlett and Andrea Migone have characterised as one of “overpromising and underdelivering”? Are the supportive discourse, creation of networks, and relatively modest financial support simply just another way of “kicking the can down the road” rather than a determined strategy? Sceptics predict a similar fate for SMRs as that which befell the nearly mythical Arrow aircraft carrier, supposed to consolidate Canadian technological leadership in the 1950s. The then Prime Minister Diefenbaker abruptly stopped the vast technology programme in 1959, arguing that rapid changes in geopolitics and technology had made Arrow obsolete. According to rumours, pressure from Americans unwilling to face competition from their northern neighbour was a vital contributing factor. The SMR promise will end like the Arrow did, critics argue: the Americans will, in the end, snatch the markets and put the Canadians back to their place.",
            "SMRs: A stepping stone back to megaprojects?",
            "For many in the nuclear community, the SMR promise appears increasingly as an instrument, a stepping stone on the way back to constructing large reactors, rather than an end in and of itself. Last year in Atlanta an entire session, chaired by OCNI’s Fehrenbach, explored the relationships between SMRs and large nuclear reactors. While the legitimacy of the SMR promise has thus far largely relied on the notion that nuclear megaprojects are just too risky, costly, and slow, SMRs are now often portrayed as a useful, if not indispensable, bridge towards large reactor projects. As presumably safer, cheaper, and multifunctional, SMRs could help to overcome the public opposition and scepticism that has handicapped large nuclear projects, so the arguement goes. Moreover, the SMR promise helps to keep nuclear in the headlines, attract talent, and retain the skills and competences needed for the construction of large reactors – a line of reasoning particularly valid in Canada, with its home-grown CANDU knowhow and well-established nuclear institutions. Finally, enthusiasm for SMRs is partly motivated by defence interests, as highlighted by policymakers and nuclear-sector insiders.",
            "Beyond the value of the SMRs as a “stepping stone”, the rather vague overall SMR promise serves various constituencies, regardless of the actual success of any specific design. By declaring their support and providing funding for R&D into SMRs, politicians can show they are acting upon the climate and energy security challenges; the R&D community benefits from new challenges and funding opportunities; and investors can make a quick buck by speculating on the stocks of SMR companies. Vendor start-ups may be among the few for whom the success of their chosen SMR design is decisive. The instrumental value of SMRs might help explain the contradiction between the rather pessimistic evaluations of the potential economic viability of SMRs on the one hand, and the growing enthusiasm towards these technologies in the policy world on the other. What counts may not be the viability of the technology itself but instead the value that the promise itself can provide, in various ways, to the diverse involved communities.",

        "title": "NEA launches second edition of its Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",
            "Much greater technological detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. The 424 pages provide data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. However, this depends largely on information from the designers. Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines."

        "text": [
            "Slovak power utility Slovenské Elektrárne (SE) hosted a two-day forum, the 5th annual VVER Fuel Forum in Bratislava. The forum on nuclear fuel for VVER 440 and VVER 1000 reactors, which was sponsored by Westinghouse, was attended by representatives of utilities that are potential customers for Westinghouse VVER fuel. These included Ukraine’s Energoatom, Finland’s Fortum, the Czech Republic’s ČEZ, Bulgaria’s JE Kozloduy, and Hungary’s nuclear plant operator MVM Paks. The participants exchanged experiences on the procedure for implementing fuel from Westinghouse for operating VVER-440 and VVER-1000 reactors.",
            "Branislav Strýček, SE Board Chairman & General Director said SE was currently “going through the preparation of the documentation in Slovakia for new VVER-440 fuel and expect to finish the licensing process by 2026-2027”.",
            "Westinghouse gave detailed briefings on fuel licensing, design enhancements of its NOVA E-6 VVER-440 fuel, fabrication plant upgrades, delivery and operations. This is a modification of a 1996-98 a fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) developed in a programme involving BNFL (UK – which later took over Westinghouse)), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In June 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies – four fixed and one follower assembly – at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion at unit 2 of Finland’s Loviisa NPP. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to the Loviisa NPP in Finland which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The NOVA E-3 and NOVCA designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006. However, in 2007 Loviisa decided to switch back to Russian fuel. After failing to extend the Loviisa fuel contract and failing to win any other VVER-440 delivery contracts, Westinghouse decided to withdraw from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and design development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "Efforts to develop new design VVER-440 fuel had restarted in 2014 in face of the demand for increased security of energy supply in Europe. Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe, and was granted €2m ($16.5m) in 2015 to launch the ESSANUF programme, which ran until 2017. Development continued and in early 2023, Westinghouse and Enusa agreed to manufacture VVER-440 fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain. The following September the first test assemblies were loaded at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP.",
            "As leader of the current European Union-funded APIS project (Accelerated Program for Implementation of secure VVER fuel Supply), Westinghouse presented to the forum information on next-generation fuel design development and a harmonised approach for VVER fuel licensing. Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel said there were many achievements in the past years and still a lot of work ahead. “As the only European VVER fuel manufacturer, we are committed to delivering what is required by our customers.”",
            "Stefano Ciccarello, Acting Director General of the Euratom Supply Agency. recommended expediting the ongoing fuel diversification efforts in the context of the REPower EU Plan launched in May 2022 and the global energy disruption caused by Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine.",
            "Olexandr Depenchuk, Director for Nuclear & Radiation Safety at Energoatom, told the forum: “In Ukraine, we started the licensing process for the Westinghouse VVER-440 fuel in 2022 and, thanks to great cooperation, we successfully completed it within 1.5 years. We received the first fuel load for Rivne unit 2 last September, ahead of the originally planned schedule. Our two units will be operating later this year with the new fuel, which has been performing well after six months.\"",
            "In Finland, Fortum is now pursuing mechanical operating experiences with the new fuel type, after a test assembly manufactured by Westinghouse was loaded into the unit 2 of the Loviisa NPP last year. Loviisa NPP comprises two Soviet designed VVER-440 units, which were commissioned in 1977 and 1980 and initially received fuel from Russia. Loviisa’s current fuel agreement with Russia’s TVEL is valid until the end of the current operating licences of the plants two units in 2027 and 2030. In spring 2022, Fortum applied for a new operating licence for both units until 2050, and announced that a tendering process would be arranged for fuel supply for the next operating licence period.",
            "“The changes done to the design of the VVER-440 fuel we originally used in Loviisa in the early 2000s improved the fuel behaviour and performance,” said Iiro-Ville Lehtinen, Fortum Project Manager. “We are currently reviewing the licensing and manufacturing documentation of the first new fuel deliveries and expect this work to be ready this summer.”",
            "Rostislav Štaubr, Head of Nuclear Fuel Procurement at ČEZ told the forum that Westinghouse will deliver the first batch of VVER-440 fuel assemblies to the VVER-440 units at the Dukovany NPP at the end of this year. The deliveries of VVER-1000 fuel for Temelín will follow a few months after Dukovany, as mutually agreed based on the refuelling schedule,” he said.",
            "Svilena Nikolova, Head of the Legal & Commercial Department at Bulgaria’s Kozloduy NPP said the diversification that has been obtained in terms of nuclear fuel supply is of great importance for the power plant. “As Kozloduy celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, we will also receive the first load of new VVER-1000 fuel from Westinghouse for our unit 5.”",
            "Neither Westinghouse nor SE reported any comments from representatives of Hungary’s Paks NPP. Although the possibility of using nuclear fuel from suppliers other than Russia’s TVEL at the Paks was legally enshrined in Hungary’s legislation at the end of 2023, the plant currently only uses nuclear fuel supplied by Rosatom enterprises. During discussions on the new legislation, State Secretary at the Ministry of Energy Attila Steiner noted that there is currently no alternative to Russian fuel for the four VVER-440 reactors at Paks.",
            "The Hungarian government has repeatedly stated that it does not intend to abandon it as long as it can be supplied reliably. Speaking at the meeting, which was broadcast on the parliament website, Steiner noted that only Rosatom enterprises can now produce fuel assemblies for those units, so Hungary is interested in ensuring that they are not subject to sanctions. At the same time, he confirmed that, in accordance with the general policy of the European Union, Hungary will strive to diversify its energy supplies including nuclear energy."

Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303m on a performance-based, fixed-price milestone basis to enable the design, construction, and commissioning of the company’s Hermes demonstration reactor. A construction permit for the reactor was issued by the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in December 2023.",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s. Hermes is to be built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",
            "Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO, noted: “With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.”",
            "DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Assistant Secretary Dr Kathryn Huff said the Hermes reactor “is an important step toward realising advanced nuclear energy’s role in ushering forward the nation’s clean energy transition”. She added: “Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.”",
            "The KP-HFR is one of five teams selected in 2020 by the DOE to receive $30m in initial funding for risk reduction projects under the ARDP. The other projects were Westinghouse Electric Company’s eVinci Microreactor, the BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR), Holtec’s SMR-160 Reactor, and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment. DOE had earlier in 2020 selected TerraPower and X-energy to receive $160m in initial funding for ARDP Demonstration projects to develop two advanced nuclear reactors to be operational within seven years.",

Planned deliveries for Temelín will follow several months later, said Marek Sviták, ČEZ spokesman at Temelín. “The diversification of fuel supplies is one of the key steps for strengthening the energy security of the Czech Republic. At the same time, the expected fuel will make possible extended fuel campaigns at all Czech nuclear units.”",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002.",
            "ČEZ began a process of diversifying its fuel suppliers in line with European Union policy with a tender in 2018. Previously fuel was supplied by Russian fuel company TVEL. CEZ still has some TVEL fuel assemblies in storage for both NPPs including at least a year’s fuel for Dukovany.",
            "In 2022 contracts were with Westinghouse and Framatome for the VVER-1000 units at Temelin. In 2022 ČEZ also decided to increase its fuel reserves stored at the NPPs to improve energy security. Bohdan Zronek, Director of the Nuclear Energy Division for ČEZ, said that the company was currently completing the expansion of storage space at Dukovany, with the aim of keeping at least three years’ supply.",
            "In 2019, six Westinghouse test fuel assemblies were inserted into the Temelín 1 reactor core to verify their properties and the results are now being evaluated by experts from both Westinghouse and ČEZ.",
            "Westinghouse fuel was previously used at Temelín from 2002 to 2009 but following technical problems including fuel deformation and incomplete rod insertion, TVEL was selected as fuel supplier. TVEL in 2006 won a tender for a 10-year fuel supply contract with delivery to start in 2009. The plan was to phase in the TVEL fuel gradually but in 2009 ČEZ decided to immediately switch to TVEL fuel in 2010 and the remaining Westinghouse fuel was removed. Westinghouse subsequently redesigned its VVER-1000 fuel following similar problems in Ukraine.",
            "However, Westinghouse has only recently designed fuel for VVER-440 reactors, which is now being tested at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP. ČEZ said, for Dukovany, Westinghouse will use fuel based on the Rivne design.",
            "Tarik Choho, President of Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel noted: “We have already supplied over 1,500 fuel assemblies for VVER-1000 reactors, which have already been verified by operation without problems and as expected. We plan to bring the latest version to Dukovany, based on fuel assemblies designed for VVER-440 reactors, which are already used at the Rivne NPP in Ukraine. And we believe it will be just as successful.”",
            "ČEZ noted that both existing (TVEL) and new types of fuel (Framatome and Westinghouse) meet the requirements for switching to longer fuel campaigns. These will be 16 months in Dukovany and 18 months in Temelín. As a result, ČEZ expects to achieve an average annual production of 32 TWh by 2030.",

            "The first of five vacuum vessel sectors for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) under construction at Cadarache in France to be supplied by Fusion for Energy (F4E) is undergoing factory acceptance tests. The component has already passed leak testing and its dimensions will now be checked.",
            "The fabrication of the vacuum vessel sectors is shared between F4E, Iter Organisation’s European domestic agency (five sectors) and the Korean Domestic Agency (four sectors). ITER’s vacuum vessel (plasma chamber), with an interior volume of 1,400 cubic metres, houses the fusion reactions and is the first safety containment barrier. It will comprise nine wedge-shaped steel sectors each more than 14 metres high and weighing 440 tonnes. Vacuum vessel sector No. 6, which is at the centre of the assembly and is associated thermal shielding, has already been manufactured and delivered by Korea.",
            "The ITER vacuum vessel, once assembled, will have an outer diameter of 19.4 metres, a height of 11.4 metres, and weigh approximately 5,200 tonnes. Installation of in-vessel components such as the blanket and the divertor will increase the weight to 8,500 tonnes.",
            "The first sector to be supplied by Europe (No. 5) has now been manufactured at the Westinghouse/Mangiarotti facility in Monfalcone, Italy, and is undergoing factory acceptance tests before being shipped to the construction site. F4E said years of teamwork in developing the procurement strategy, agreeing on the design, the technical specifications, and following up its manufacturing, “have come down to this make-or-break moment in the lifecycle of the component”. F4E added: “The valuable lessons learnt from sectors delivered by Korea, and the knowledge accumulated from the collaboration between F4E and the AMW consortium (Ansaldo Nucleare, Mangiarotti and Walter Tosto) have fed into this exercise.” tests consist of hydraulic and dimensional checks.",
            "Hydraulic testing of sector No. 5 was completed in January. F4E said the results were “solid proof that the welding, assembly and manufacturing met the highest standards”. The tests used nitrogen and helium to examine the response to pressure and vacuum to ensure that there were no leaks in the structure. “Checking these parameters is of paramount importance because the fusion reaction requires an environment which is completely tight,” F4E noted. “Furthermore, the vacuum vessel is classified as a nuclear component that needs to comply with the strict prerequisites set by the French Nuclear Safety Authority.”",
            "Joan Caixas, F4E Assembly Project Manager attributed the successful outcome of these operations to years of cooperation between F4E, ITER Organisation and AMW. “The results give us a lot of confidence for the next tests and ultimately for the delivery of Europe’s first sector,” she noted. These dimensional tests will need more time given the volume of the component. They will accurately measure the component using sophisticated probes, lasers, and other tooling to scan the surface, spot any deformations, etc.",
            "When the factory acceptance tests are completed, the component will be transported to the ITER construction site and is expected to leave Mangiarotti later this year by boat for the port of Marseille. From there, it will be loaded onto a large track, and by applying the protocol of a heavy exceptional convoy, it will be transported to the site.",
            "Construction of ITER is funded mainly by the European Union (45.6%) with the remainder shared equally by China, India, Japan, Korea, Russia and the USA (9.1% each). However, in practice, the members deliver little monetary contribution to the project, instead providing ‘in-kind’ contributions of components, systems or buildings."

            "Ringhals 1, a 910 MWe boiling water reactor (BWR) was built by Asea Atom between 1969 and 1975 and began operation in 1976. The other three units at the Ringhals NPP are Westinghouse pressurised water reactors (PWRs), including the 960 MWe Ringhals 2. Ringhals 3&4, both 1100MWe plants, are expected to operate until the beginning of the 2040s.",
            "Ringhals 1&2 were originally expected to operate for 50 years, until 2025 and 2026 but Vattenfall's Board of Directors decided in 2015 their early closure in face of low electricity prices and the need for major investments to necessary refurbishment. In August 2021, Vattenfall awarded a contract to Westinghouse for the segmentation and disposal of the reactor pressure vessels, internals and fuel racks at Ringhals 1&2."

Previously operation was set for 30 March. In a filing to investors Georgia Power said the vibrations \"were similar in nature\" to those experienced during start-up testing for unit 3, which began commercial operations last year.",
            "At unit 3, the utility found that a pipe vibrated during testing because construction workers failed to install enough bracing. Georgia Power said the unit 4 problem has already been fixed but significant testing still needs to be done. Georgia Power estimated a loss of $30m in profit for every additional month of delay because of an earlier order by state utility regulators.",
            "The five members of the Georgia Public Service Commission ruled that the company cannot earn any additional return on equity through a construction surcharge levied on Georgia Power's 2.7m customers after 30 March. The construction budget will not be affected provided unit 4 begins operating by June 30. However, Georgia Power said it would have to pay $15m a month in extra construction costs if the project extends into July.",
            "Vogtle 4 suffered previous delays in October 2023 following the discovery of a malfunctioning coolant pump. The unit had been expected begin operation later in 2023 but this was revised to the first quarter of 2024. The problem with the coolant pump was an “isolated event,” Georgia Power said in a report filed with the US Securities & Exchange Commission.",

Vogtle 3&4 are both 1,117 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The two units were originally expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn.

Applicants were also expected to demonstrate at least $6bn in turnover and profit for five years from 2018 to 2022.",
            "Deputy Energy Minister Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's official BTA news agency in December that the aim was to achieve a price of about €6bn ($6.5bn) for each of the units. For comparison, in 2014, when an earlier agreement was signed for the construction of Kozloduy 5 using AP-1000 technology, its price was estimated at $7.7bn.",
            "The Ministry of Energy did not reveal the names of the companies. However, at the end of January, KZNPP Director Valentin Nikolov told reporters that unofficial interest had been expressed by US Bechtel, which is already working with Westinghouse projects in Poland and the Czech Republic, and South Korea’s Hyundai, another Westinghouse partner. Other potential candidates included China National Nuclear Corporation, Électricité de France (EDF) and US-based Fluor, the parent company of small modular reactor company NuScale.",

Preliminary talks with banks have already been held, he noted, but the details will become clear at a later stage. In December, the Bulgarian parliament approved a government proposal to inject up to BGN1.5bn ($834.7m) into Kozloduy NPP for the construction of the two new reactors. According to Nikolov, between 5,000 and 10,000 people are expected to be directly involved in the construction of the two units and supporting activities.",

        "title": "Czech government extends nuclear tender to four reactors but excludes Westinghouse",
        "text": [
            "The Czech government has decided to amend its tender for new nuclear to binding offers for up to four reactors, rather than one and invited bids only from Électricité de France (EDF) and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). The third bidder, Westinghouse, was not included because it \"did not meet the necessary conditions\".",
            "Prime Minister Fiala said: \"During the tender, the non-binding offers showed that the construction of several units – up to four units in one package – even if implemented gradually, is economically significantly more advantageous. “It is also significantly more advantageous than we expected, by up to 25% compared with the construction of only one unit,” he noted.",
            "According to the original tender, power company ČEZ’s subsidiary, Elektrárna Dukovany II (EDU II), in October 2023 accepted bids from the three companies for a binding offer for a new fifth unit at the Dukovany NPP as well as non-binding offers for three more reactors. EDU II was to evaluate the bids and report to the Czech government in early in 2024 with the aim of finalising contracts within a year, for construction to start in 2029 and trial operation in 2036. EDF proposed its EPR1200 reactor, Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power proposed its APR1000 and Westinghouse proposed its AP1000. All three companies agreed to work with Czech suppliers if selected.",
            "\"From the beginning, the goal of the tender process was to obtain and select the best possible offer for the Czech Republic, both in terms of price, quality and safety of delivery,\" Fiala noted. The tender will now be expanded to be for binding offers for units 5&6 at Dukovany and units 3&4 at Temelin NPP. KHNP and EDF will now have until 15 April to submit their binding offers and EDU II will report on them to the government by the end of May for a final decision by the end of June.",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. The Dukovany units will be decommissioned no later than 2045-2047.",
            "According to a lengthy briefing on the government website, the aim of the tender amendment is “to secure a better negotiating position for the negotiation of the construction of additional units, because on the basis of a non-binding offer, the investor cannot demand any liabilities from bidders and would thus risk a disproportionate increase in the project price”. Making the offers binding is important “to achieve the best possible conditions for the Czech Republic and the highest possible level of security regarding the price of construction of additional units”. This step “will also ensure greater transparency”.",
            "The government explained its decision to expand the tender to four units, citing rising electricity demand and plans to close coal-powered plants. However, it added: “It is not yet possible to reveal the exact number of nuclear units that will be needed. Given the required performance, both large reactors in the Dukovany and Temelín nuclear sites and small and medium-sized reactors will undoubtedly be needed.”",
            "On costs, it noted that “economies of scale will make it possible to significantly reduce the average price per unit”. Still to be decided is “the investor model and future relations between the state and ČEZ”. Discussion were still underway on the possibility of a state takeover of ČEZ but “above all, it is important to ensure that such a step does not lead to a delay in the construction schedule”. On notification of the new plans to the European Commission, the government said “notification of the existing one-unit model will be completed” and for the other units “a discussion on the public support scheme will begin in the coming months”.",
            "As to why Westinghouse was not included in the new tender, the government noted that discussions with Westinghouse had been ongoing for almost five years and “we are very sorry about this fact”. However, “Westinghouse did not meet the key requirements of the tender. Above all, its offer is not binding, which makes it impossible to assess the offer. And then the subject responsible for the quality of the work is not clearly identified. Therefore, the decision is now to address only candidates who submitted a binding offer. At the same time, no one is eliminated, and the tender is not completed until we have signed an EPC contract for the supply and construction of a new unit.”",
            "The government also addressed the dispute between KHNP and Westinghouse, which ČEZ considers to be a risk. In September 2023, Westinghouse decided to continue a legal battle against South Korean firms despite a US court dismissing its lawsuit. Westinghouse in October 2022 alleged that Korea’s APR1400 reactors copied the System 80 reactor designed by Combustion Engineering, which was acquired by Westinghouse in 2000. The litigation was a move by Westinghouse to prevent Korean companies from transferring technical information on reactor designs, which it claims have been licensed by it, to Poland and other countries, under a US export control regulation, known as Part 810. Westinghouse insists that the Korean companies using its technologies need to obtain the approval of the US government before exporting them to a third country.",
            "“We are monitoring the development of the dispute. We requested from the applicants and at the same time obtained a certificate of ownership of the rights to the offered technology, both in the safety assessment and in the current offers.” The Czech government noted. “Tender participants had to prove that they are owners and suppliers of nuclear technology. Their APR 1400 project has been licensed in South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, as well as [having] design certification from US nuclear regulators…. Due to the limitations of the Dukovany site, it modified its APR1400 project to a 1000 MWe project (APR1000). Last year, they obtained certification according to the requirements of European operators (the APR1400 project received this certificate as early as 2017).”",
            "The amended tender was also discussed at a follow-up press conference addressed by Prime Minister Petr Fiala, Industry & Trade Minister Josef Síkel, Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura and ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš. After outlining the details of the amended tender, Fiala noted: “The Czech Republic now has a chance to use its knowledge, capabilities, its long tradition of nuclear energy and become one of the centres of nuclear energy. And the construction of new units at our nuclear power plants is a huge opportunity not only to have enough energy at affordable prices, but it is also a great opportunity for the domestic economy and industry.”",
            "Trade Minister Síkela said the coming years would see “a major transformation of Czech energy”, which “requires us to increase the installed capacity of nuclear power plants”. He cited the advantages of ordering more reactors at the same time. “The price per unit could be reduced by up to 25%, which in practice means that the last fourth reactor would be more or less free at the current proposed prices”. In addition, “a larger order also means more orders for Czech: industry”.",
            "He added: “That is why we approved with government colleagues today that we will ask the bidders of the tender to submit their bids for the construction of more reactors in a binding form.” He confirmed that “the bid submitted by the US-Canadian consortium did not meet the necessary conditions”. In particular, “its offer is not binding and cannot therefore be assessed in a comparable way, so we will continue with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Corporation and Électricité de France”.",
            "Finance Minister Zbyněk Stanjura said the government's decision was unanimous. He added that, by the end of May, “we will know the exact numbers for the construction of up to four new nuclear units, which will of course improve our negotiating position when we negotiate the final version of the contract with the selected bidder”. However, he stressed that the method of financing that was intended for the construction of Dukovany 5 “cannot be repeated four times”.",
            "The government had, therefore, decided “that we will create a small expert group, where there will be mainly representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry & Trade and the future investor, which will submit to the government by the end of this year at the latest a financing model for one to four nuclear units”. He stressed that the new arrangement “will also contribute to greater transparency of the whole competition, and at the same time we hope that the two remaining candidates will really improve their offers”.",
            "ČEZ CEO Daniel Beneš said: “Our goal is to get a turnkey delivery with clear guarantees, with a clear price, with clear deadlines, with clear sanctions if those deadlines are not met, and with clear parameters”. On the previous bids he noted: “It is clear from those offers that there is potential for improvement, especially in that, if more of unit are bought” So “from a commercial, strategic point of view for the state, I think it is prudent at the moment to ask those candidates who have made a binding offer for more clarification… so that the government can decide on the preferred bidder by the middle of the year”.",
            "In reply to a question, referring to Westinghouse, Sikela elaborated: “We demanded binding turnkey offers. Applicants have had the tender documentation available sometime since June 2021, and we have always dealt with them on an ongoing basis and pointed out what is key for us. And key for us from the beginning was a turnkey delivery with certain price guarantees and at the same time, say, certain sanctions for non-compliance with contracts, for example for time shifts and so on.” He added: “It is a bit of a surprise that this consortium did not deliver the offer in the required form, but simply from our point of view it was unevaluable.” Finance Minister Stanjura clarified: “We didn't kick anyone out today. We asked the other two candidates for further refinement and improvement of the offer.”",

He told reporters that the meeting also agreed that Krško-II, estimated to cost €10bn ($10.8bn), \"is such an important project… that it is essential to build a political consensus around it”.",
            "Holding the referendum soon is seen as important for ensuring the speed of the development, with the aim of a final investment decision in 2027 or 2028 and the new capacity online in the 2030s. The meeting agreed to consider ways of expediting the legislative process relating to the new unit, according to the prime minister's office.",
            "A working group of government ministers and industry officials was established in September 2023 to speed up implementation of the project and prepare \"all the necessary bases for citizens to make high-quality and informed decisions\". about it in a referendum which the government says is needed for the project to happen. In October, Krško plant operator GEN Energiia CEO Dejan Paravan said there were three technology providers being considered for the project – Westinghouse, EDF and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power – who all had strengths and \"the decision will not be easy\".",
            "Speaking after the meeting he stressed that unification of policy in the recognition of nuclear energy as an integral part of the solution for the transition to a low-carbon and self-sufficient future is extremely important in further preparatory activities for the JEK2 project. “The support of the citizens of Slovenia expressed in the referendum would definitely speed up the project activities.”",
            "GEN Energija says its activities are aimed at preparations siting the new plant, in coordinated with the government's working group so that a final investment decision on the project can be made “by 2028 at the latest”. In parallel, several studies are in the final phase, including a seismic study of the site and a study on connecting JEK2 to the electricity system of Slovenia, as well as the preparation of business model proposals and the supplier selection process.",

            "Khmelnitskiy Nuclear Power Plant. (Credit: RLuts/Wikipedia)",
            "Ukraine’s Minister of Energy Herman Halushchenko has revealed plans to build four new units at the Khmelnitsky NPP with construction expected to start later this year. These include two Russian designed VVER-1000 units to be built using equipment imported from the cancelled Belene project in Bulgaria. The other two will be Westinghouse-supplied AP-1000 units.",
            "Khmelnitsky currently operates two VVER-1000 units (1&2). “With the third and fourth units we want to compensate for Zaporizhia, and now we are in talks with our Bulgarian partners on the two reactors we want to take,” said Halushchenko. “If we received the reactor vessels today, I think it would take two and a half years and we would have a third reactor operating.” He added that new legislation would be needed for construction of the new plants.",
            "The six-unit Zaporizhia NPP was taken over by Russia shortly after the start of its special military operation in Ukraine and has now been integrated into the Russian nuclear system although all the units are shutdown. Ukraine currently has three operating NPPs with nine reactors. These are located in Khmelnitsky (two units), Rivne (four units), and South Ukraine (three units). These supply around 55% of Ukraine’s electricity.",
            "Khmelnitsky’s first unit began operation in 1987, but work on three others was frozen in 1990. Work on unit 2 restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004 but units 3 and 4 remain uncompleted. In December 2023, Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom and Westinghouse signed an agreement on the purchase of equipment for Khmelnitsky unit 5 with plans also to construct an AP1000 as unit 6."

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has received a shipment of used next-generation light water reactor LWR) fuel from a commercial NPP to support research and testing for the first time in two decades. INL said it had received 25 experimental fuel rods irradiated in the reactor core of a commercial reactor. The fuel rods were developed and manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Company with technical assistance from several US national laboratories, including INL.",
            "Each fuel rod is 12 feet long, and the total shipment contains about 100 pounds of heavy metal, mostly uranium, INL noted. The shipment contains both accident tolerant fuel (ATF) and high burn-up fuel. Industry and DOE have collaborated over a decade to design ATF that offer enhanced safety performance during normal operations, mild operational transients and accident scenarios. High burn-up fuels take advantage of unrealised performance capacity available in advanced materials that can allow for extended operating cycles and/or increase the licensed power generation at existing NPPs while significantly reducing used fuel generation.",
            "These experimental fuels, designed for extended use and robust safety features, could deliver significant cost savings for consumers while increasing NPP resilience under potential accident conditions, INL said. However, first, researchers need to examine and analyse the fuel to evaluate how this advanced technology performed during normal usage. Researchers will conduct additional experiments to understand how the fuel performs under postulated accident conditions. Lastly, researchers will perform experiments to demonstrate behaviour during storage and recycling.",
            "Experts will analyse and test the fuel at INL’s Materials & Fuels Complex. There, experts will use remote manipulators in the nation’s largest inert-atmosphere hot cell to perform analyses and tests. Researchers will also subject the fuels to safety tests – simulations of power excursions or loss-of-cooling events in a controlled environment that are designed to push the fuel to its breaking points and beyond. “Safety testing for fuels is like crash testing for your car,” said Fabiola Cappia, the post irradiation examination department manager at INL. “You push it to the limit and beyond.”",
            "The data generated from these experiments and analyses are essential to establish the safety bases required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow the fuel’s use at more US NPPs. Researchers say the new fuel rods, when licensed for commercial use, could extend the amount of time a plant can operate between refuelling from 18 to 24 months.",
            "“Increased burnup, when combined with potential ATF-related uprates, could be a huge economic benefit to those plants and the fleet,” said Daniel Wachs, national technical director of DOE’s Advanced Fuels Campaign. “The increased electrical output in the US could be the equivalent of adding new reactors to the fleet.”",
            "“Continuous innovation is key to improving the nuclear sector’s reliability, especially at a time when energy demand is increasing and nuclear’s role is more vital than ever,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “Westinghouse is proud to join efforts with INL and other partners in the production and testing of these advanced nuclear fuels.”",
            "Westinghouse and other nuclear fuel developers, in concert with national laboratories, have spent years developing new fuels for the existing nuclear reactor fleet. INL’s experiments and examinations of the fuel after time spent in a commercial nuclear reactor is one step in the qualification process.",
            "An earlier shipment of irradiated nuclear fuel rods with this new technology was delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. The advanced testing and the post-irradiation examinations at both laboratories are key milestones to receive final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to deploy this innovative fuel to commercial reactors around the globe. The National Laboratories will provide valuable data to Westinghouse, the NRC, the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, as well as regulatory and scientific bodies in Japan, Korea, and Western Europe.",
            "“We wouldn’t be able to get across the finish line with these technologies if we couldn’t examine the rods,” said David Kamerman, a nuclear fuel research and development engineer at INL. “It’s a really big deal. There are not many places in the world that can do the work, and none of them match the capability of Idaho National Laboratory.”",
            "INL is also preparing the Advanced Test Reactor to accommodate fuels for endurance tests that mimic the wear and tear incurred over a decade of service in a commercial reactor in a fraction of the time. This step can support pursuing even higher burnup than that achieved in the commercial plant testing.",
            "Experts will also use the material to explore used fuel management approaches. The material will be examined to measure thermal and mechanical properties, data that is essential for understanding transportation and dry storage behavior. This work also includes demonstrating electrochemical recycling technologies as an option to recover and recycle valuable uranium and other fissile isotopes.",
            "“Receiving these fuel rods is a significant milestone for INL and the nuclear energy industry,” said INL Director John Wagner. As the nation’s nuclear energy research and development centre, we possess the unique facilities, capabilities and expertise to perform this vital research,” Wagner said. “Completion of this shipment, along with the state of Idaho’s reinstatement of the Department of Energy’s ability to receive up to 400 kilograms of commercial spent nuclear fuel per year at INL for research and development purposes, send a strong message that we are once again open for business. This has been a long time coming and I genuinely appreciate the state’s ongoing engagement with DOE to enable this critical work.”",

        "text": [
            "US-based Zeno Power has selected Westinghouse Electric Company to process radioisotopes to fabricate its heat sources for its radioisotope power systems (RPSs). Zeno is working to bring its first commercial RPSs to market by 2026. Zeno’s work with Westinghouse will build upon its nuclear demonstration at the US Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in October 2023. The demonstration confirmed that Zeno's patented innovation increases the specific power (Wth/kg) of its Sr-90 heat source compared with historic Sr-90 heat sources.",
            "Radioisotope power systems that convert heat into electricity for off-grid power have been used for space missions ranging from the Apollo moonshots to the Curiosity rover mission to Mars and the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Those systems have typically used plutonium-238, but Zeno is working on systems that make use of other radioisotopes such as strontium-90 (Sr-90), which is created as a byproduct in nuclear fission reactors. Existing strontium-based power systems tend to be bulky and Zeno’s more compact design could open the way for a wider range of applications.",
            "\"We’ve demonstrated the core building block of our technology – now we’re pleased to be working with the remarkable team at Westinghouse to enable and accelerate the deployment of our commercial RPSs,” said Harsh S Desai, Zeno Power Chief Commercialisation Officer.",
            "Tyler Bernstein, Co-Founder & CEO of Zeno Power said working with Westinghouse, “we will build the nuclear hardware for our RPSs to provide reliable power in the most critical domains of the 21st century – from the depths of the oceans to the surface of the Moon”.",

        "text": [
            "Canadian firm Prodigy Clean Energy and US-based Westinghouse are designing a transportable NPP (TNPP) featuring a Westinghouse eVinci microreactor with the aim of launching the first project in Canada by 2030. The TNPP will comprise 5 MWe eVinci microreactors installed on a floating Prodigy Microreactor Power Station. According to a Westinghouse blog, the TNPP would be pre-fabricated and transported to site to supply power and heat to “remote industrial sites, data centres, communities, defence installations, and to islands and island nations”.",
            "To date, the only operational purpose-built floating NPP is Rosatom’s 70 MWe/58 MWt Akademik Lomonosov moored at Pevek in Chukotka in the Russian Arctic Russia’s Far East, which began supplying heat and power to the region in May 2020. Rosatom is in the process of building several morefor Artic industrial sites.",
            "According to Westinghouse, “The IAEA defines a TNPP as ‘a factory manufactured, movable nuclear power plant… capable of producing final energy products such as electricity and heat’.” it said. “This includes ‘Floating Nuclear Power Plants’ that are docked close to where the energy is needed, reducing the need for building the permanent infrastructure.”",
            "Prodigy’s design is for a shipyard-fabricated vessel that would be outfitted and transported by a dedicated heavy-lift carrier to its mooring. “But then the deployment itself would have specific infrastructure in place to hold and house the vessel in a safe place,” Prodigy Clean Energy President & CEO Mathias Trojer explained during a November 2023 panel at the IAEA’s first symposium on FNPPs. This is in effect a replica of the Akademik Lomonosov project.",
            "Trojan added: “We are merging proven technologies in nuclear engineering and nuclear civil construction with decades of experience in marine manufacturing, [operations and maintenance (O&M), lifecycle management of vessels, and integrating these with well-established approaches to nuclear and heavy equipment transport.” He said: “By selecting SMRs with proven safety and operability features at an adequate level of technology readiness, and capitalizing on best practices across these three industries, Prodigy will deliver FNPPs that are safe, robust, economical, but most importantly, licensable under current frameworks and ready for near-term implementation.” However, as yet, the eVinci technology is not proven and still in the design stage,",
            "Prodigy is developing two TNPP projects – the Microreactor Power Station, which can be marine or land-based, and a Grid-Scale Station, which would be installed at a shoreline within a protected harbour. Prodigy earlier signed a memorandum of understanding with NuScale Power for a grid-scale marine TNPP with up to 12 NuScale modules (for a combined output of 924-MWe). The companies completed conceptual design and economic assessments for the potential project in 2021 but it remains to be seen how this will be affected by the recent cancellation of NuScale’s project with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) to construction of six SMRs at the US Department of Energy's (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL).",
            "The eVinci microreactor is a transportable reactor that is fully factory built, fuelled and assembled, and capable of delivering combined heat (up to 13 MWt) and power (up to 5 MWe). Its small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment, with superior reliability and minimal maintenance, making it suitable for use in remote locations. It will use TRISO fuel. It is one of several advanced reactor designs being supported through ARDP to help accelerate the development and deployment of new reactor technologies.",
            "Westinghouse said work toward a potential TNPP design for the eVinci, has progressed relatively quickly. “A multinational corporation operating strategic critical minerals assets in Canada funded a study in 2019-2020 to identify more reliable clean energy sources. In the study, Prodigy assessed the eVinci microreactor for deployment in a marine facility fixed at shoreside to power a remote mine.”",
            "In 2022, Westinghouse and Prodigy signed an agreement to further a potential TNPP design customised for eVinci. To date, supported by an award from Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund, the companies have completed “milestones” for conceptual engineering and regulatory studies. Westinghouse said the next steps include “completing the TNPP design for the eVinci microreactor, completing development of a nuclear oversight model for TNPP manufacturing, outfitting and transport, and progressing licensing and site assessments to support a first project in Canada by 2030”.",
            "Addressing the IAEA panel in November, Trojer acknowledged that several challenges lie ahead for the widespread deployment of FNPPs. “Executing the development and deployment of an FNPP is a very complex exercise that needs to be carefully planned and systematically carried out,” he said. While the Akademik Lomonosov “is a highly successful proof of concept” as the industry sets out to “pioneer a new paradigm, there are significant questions that must be answered around the design, replicability, standardisation, the regulations, and more generally, the legal framework”.",

While the units are to have Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, US-based Westinghouse will not take part in the construction but will retain overall control of the project. Applications must be in English and have to be in by 2 February – “any application received after this deadline will not be considered”.",
            "Deputy Energy Minister Nikolay Nikolov told Bulgaria's official BTA news agency in December that the aim was to achieve a price of about €6bn ($6.5bn) for each of the units. It also quoted him as saying that potential construction companies had been narrowed down to Bechtel, Fluor and Hyundai, and that the Bulgarian state was expected to be the only investor in the project.",

He added that preparations for the construction of Kozloduy unit 8 would also begin so that the units could be put into operation at intervals of two to three years.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades.",

Company Director Valentin Iliev was relieved of his post along with Management Board members Georgi Kirkov and Ivaylo Ivanov. Petyo Ivanov was elected new CEO. He is a former director of Bulgarian Energy Holding (BEH) and Board Chairman of Bulgargaz. In 2019, the anti-corruption commission accused him of a conflict of interest because, as head of BEH, he determined his salary in Bulgargaz and he was dismissed.",

        "text": [
            "It is neither sensible nor safe to replace the Russian nuclear fuel used in the VVER-440 reactors at Hungary’s Paks NPP with fuel from another supplier, Hungarian nuclear engineer Zsolt Hárfás said in an interview with Magyar Nemzet. “An often asked question is whether fresh Russian nuclear fuel used in the VVER-440 reactors at the Paks NPP can be quickly replaced by fuel from alternative producers. The short answere is ‘no’ because currently none of the Western manufacturers has an officially approved fuel assembly suitable for VVER-440 units,” he said.",
            "He explained that the reason for this is nuclear safety. It takes at least five to seven years for a NPP operator to switch to new nuclear fuel from another manufacturer. “This is the case even if the new fuel has already been developed,” he pointed out. This is the time it takes for operational testing, measurements, including the removal of the used fuel and associated measures, and the licensing process by the nuclear authority. “This process cannot be compared to switching from Russian gas to, for example, US LNG overnight,” he stressed.",
            "Although diversification may be an important consideration, this should only be considered if, in addition to the priority of nuclear safety, the alternative manufacturer is able to guarantee the same or better quality, not to mention the other conditions such as reliability and price. “There is currently no manufacturer other than Russia that has licensed fuel that meets these conditions,” he said.",
            "While Westinghouse has been mentioned as a possible alternative, Hárfás said he did not consider the company to be professional In the context of the war in Ukraine and with EU support, it is trying to supplant Rosatom in the Central European nuclear fuel market. However, he noted that its VVER-440 fuel was not yet licensed and that the costs of its ongoing development would be passed on to future customers.",
            "He emphasised that Rosatom has been a reliable supplier and has continued to meet its international obligations and deliveries on a continuous and timely basis despite the Ukrainian conflict. Fuel for Paks had arrived regularly and the plant now has enough fresh fuel reserves for about three years instead two as before. Hárfás added that Rosatom is constantly improving its fuels. At Paks the four units are now operating on a 15-month fuel cycle instead of 12 months as a result of these improvements.",
            "He noted that new Russian third-generation fuel had recently been installed for the first time at unit 4 of the Czech Republic’s Dukovany NPP and that the fuel had been specially developed for the plant. He added that improved Russian fuel developed for the Czech plants had improved the physical and thermal-hydraulic properties of the fuel, increasing efficiency by providing greater performance and extending the length of the fuel cycle of Dukovany to 16 months. He pointed out that this, as well as the transition of the Czech Temelin NPP’s VVER-1000 units to a 18-month fuel cycle using Russian fuel, means that the two NPPs can now produce 2 TWh more electricity a year.",

That could spark a new nuclear era, bringing all the benefits of low-carbon, energy dense and dispatchable resource to diverse new markets and applications. Some of the SMR designs that are being proposed are generational types of existing power station reactors. However, a lot of the designs are newer technologies, for example molten salt reactor technology or heat pipe reactors. The problem is that for these newer technologies and the types of fuels that are going to be used in them, the regulatory framework is simply not in place.",
            "Simon Chaplin, transport specialist at the World Nuclear Transport Institute (WNTI) outlines some of the issues: “If you’re transporting the fuel for some of the reactors being proposed, this is high assay, low enriched uranium [HALEU]. That’s higher than the enrichment for which the majority of packaging has been designed for, so the regulatory authorities will be need to look at new packaging and then developing the regulations that surround that.”",
            "Another area of regulatory concern is transportation not just of fuel, but of fully fuelled turn-key reactors. “We may have SMRs where they’re transported without fuel involved, which won’t be difficult because there’s no nuclear element to it. It’s just something which is transported, constructed, and then the fuel will be taken to the site where it’s used. This approach would be operated in the same way that they do now with conventional large-scale nuclear power stations.”",
            "He cites the Akademik Lomonosov floating nuclear power plant. ”That’s classed as an SMR but really that’s using established technology in that it’s based on PWRs so it’s technology that’s been around for a number of years,” says Chaplin. However, he adds: “Some SMRs will be constructed in a yard or a factory where the fuel will be loaded at the same time that it’s constructed or shortly after, maybe in that location or in a secondary location. At that point it will need to be transported with fuel which may be HALEU fuel or maybe more conventional fuel but the challenge we will have is that at the moment, if you’re transporting, say, new fuel to go in a power station there are specific types of packaging. If you now have fuel inside the reactor, then are regulatory issues associated with classifying the reactor as a fuel package or as a reactor in operation?”",
            "This is a more complex issue than it may at first appear, as Chaplin explains: “If it’s classified as a reactor in operation, you could look at using the same rules that are in place for, say, the maritime estate for a nuclear-powered ship. In this case the reactor is considered to be just a part of the ship. However, if it’s a module that’s being transported in a turnkey state with fuel on board, it would be cargo. Under those circumstances there are separate rules to consider it as cargo rather than part of a vessel or conveyance but also whether it is classified as a package.”",
            "If it is considered a package then the actual reactor that’s being carried would have to be able to withstand the same sort of conditions that a package would have to, for example a drop test, an immersion test, a stacking test, and a fire test. “All of those conditions would have to be applied to the reactor and that may not be something that’s easy to achieve. That is an immediate challenge to understand how we’re going to do that and how the various regulatory frameworks would apply,” notes Chaplin.",
            "Designing reactors for lifecycle transport",
            "One of the other associated with transportation and that must be established prior to deployment are the rules and regulations concerning the way that SMRs are potentially operated.",
            "Conventional nuclear power stations are generally operated by an entity that regulatory or government authorities usually have quite close control over concerning the operations of a plant. They are also typically large sites that feature lots of physical security with fences and security guards and they’re generally close to a populated area where people can relatively easily respond to emergencies or security incidents that may arise. For an SMR it could be that none of these conditions may apply.",
            "“With an SMR potentially they may be located in a very remote area and there’s also the potential that they may even be operating automatically and therefore maybe unmanned. The operators will have to make sure that things like safety, security and safeguards would need to be considered in the actual design stages. Just as safety by design is already a consideration so there will be security by design and safeguards by design as well,” says Chaplin, who adds: “Designers will need to consider where it is and how it’s going to be operated to make sure that there is sufficient safety, security and safeguards. That will also apply to the transport phases of the operation too, during transport to the site of operation, during operation and then during the decommissioning.”",
            "Indeed, decommissioning is potentially another particular challenge for SMRs. Chaplin expands on this theme: “Within the design of all of the SMRs that are proposed, the decommissioning process must be considered as well. It may not be possible to decommission in the same way as a conventional site where decommissioning is done in situ and components are taken apart. Instead, they may have to consider an SMR with a spent fuel inside it which will need to be transported to another site for decommissioning.”",
            "While it is clear that designers will need to make sure that all SMRs will be suitable for the operations necessary for the entire life cycle, not all are giving sufficient prominence to the transport issue. As Chaplin observes: “Within the WNTI membership we’ve got several companies that have been designing SMRs and transport is something that they definitely think about, whereas others sometimes indicate that transportation is an issue to be considered at some later date. That’s quite remiss because if you can’t transport it, you’re not going to be able to operate it either. In terms of potential barriers to SMR deployment that’s a deal breaker. If you can’t move the fuel or you can’t move the reactor to the site or take it away again, that’s it. It’s dead in the water”.",
            "Establishing regulatory frameworks",
            "In considering SMRs there are potentially two different types that require considerably different approaches. Some designs are delivered as a complete unit or modules that get assembled in a location and which will stay in that location for the entirety of the unit’s operational life. There are also potentially designs which will be very mobile and which feature an easily transportable containerised reactor, possibly with some other containers which would carry the balance of plant. They may be used for disaster relief, for example, as they can be taken to a location, operated for a number of weeks or months and then taken somewhere else. The fact that a reactor could be moved has some profound implications for the regulatory regime.",
            "Chaplin explains: “At the moment the countries that are talking about using SMRs are countries which already have a developed or even an early-stage nuclear industry or a nuclear regulator. However, there are a lot of countries which will be using SMRs which don’t have a nuclear regulator. They may well not have had any reason to develop a nuclear regulatory framework. Inevitably the host nation would need to have some sort of oversight and some way to intervene if necessary but if they haven’t got a developed nuclear regulator, they won’t have the skills to do that. That is a lot to do.”",
            "In that situation, the host nation are perhaps not going to want to have to develop the necessary regulatory bodies or take too much responsibility for oversight of a plant. In which case it’s more likely that the regulatory side will just focus on making sure that operations are being conducted safely while the operator will be responsible for all of the running, maintenance, staffing and also taking the reactors away at the end of the project. However, where those responsibilities lie will need to established in advance, as Chaplin says: “I think another thing which really needs to be considered by the designers and operators long before deployment is to actually work out who will be responsible for what. That is not so difficult with, say, a land-based SMR but for a floating one that could be more challenging. It will need to determined whether responsibility rests with the country that supplied it and is operating it, if they’re going to be responsible for things like safety, security and safeguards, for example, or whether it would be the host state that would be responsible for those. We don’t really know the answer as to how that will work yet.”",
            "These regulatory issues may also have far-reaching implications for market development too. For some SMR designs, from a regulatory stance and an operations perspective, they are not really any different to the large-scale plants that are already in operation or being developed. “For these kinds of designs the actual modules will be transported without any fuel involved so they are just pieces of equipment that will be constructed and operated in the same way as a large-scale PWR. Designs from Westinghouse, Rolls-Royce, and GE Hitachi are essentially smaller versions of conventional designs and so are potentially going to avoid a lot of these transport and regulatory issues because it’s already been done for their bigger cousins. They might actually get ahead of advanced designs just because they already have, for example, transport package approval and all the associated validation and testing,” notes Chaplin.",
            "Progress on regulatory frameworks",
            "Although many issues remain outstanding to develop the right regulatory frameworks that will be appropriate for all the various SMR designs, progress is clearly being made. Chaplin explains: “Within the international Atomic Energy Agency they are beginning to look at all the regulatory environments. Similarly, in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), because there are similar issues but also additional ones with transporting a nuclear power plant at sea, there aren’t really the rules in place for doing that.”",
            "WNTI have been invited by the IAEA to participate in working groups for transportable nuclear power plants, for example while another working group is being established specifically for floating nuclear power plants to help guide member states as they develop the regulations.",
            "“They do see the importance of industry being involved in these discussions and not just safety, security and safeguards. They realise that they can’t just have the member states sit around the table and start coming up with what’s good, they need to have industry input just so that they can be certain the regulations and the recommendations that they come up with actually work,” says Chaplin.",
            "Considering the IMO rules, fundamental changes will be needed to accommodate SMRs. “At the moment, it looks like one potential solution is to revise the rules within the safety of life at sea convention and specifically chapter eight, which is the code of safety for nuclear-powered merchant ships. That could be revised to encompass floating nuclear power stations as well. A floating nuclear power station has got to be towed somewhere by sea so there will be maritime regulations that will apply to it. At the moment, that regulation was drafted in the 1960s and was released in 1981. It’s hopelessly out of date given it was written at a time when they were only concerned with nuclear-powered merchant vessels which never really took off other than in the Russian Federation and formerly the Soviet Union,” says Chaplin.",
            "Indeed, WNTI is currently conducting an analysis to explore what changes would be needed to those regulations to bring them up to date so that they can encompass not just nuclear-powered vessels, but also floating nuclear power plants and more specifically those that use new technologies like molten salt reactors alongside the more conventional pressurized water reactors. Aside from floating reactors, the shipping of reactors that are designed for terrestrial applications would potentially fall within those same rules or may come under one of the other regulations that cover cargo. Similarly, carrying a fuelled reactor as cargo might come under the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG) or the Irradiated Nuclear Fuels (INF) code, which are the regulations that apply when transporting irradiated fuel plutonium and high-level waste at sea. Those regulations could be expanded to encompass reactors with fuel on board, whether it be for deployment or under the circumstances where it’s being returned with spent fuel on board. Nonetheless, this is a work in progress, as Chapin notes: “At the moment, it’s not been done and no one has shipped a reactor with fuel in it as a cargo. The only time they have been moved at sea they are part of the conveyance so that will be completely new. None of this is actually in place, and the same applies to the packaging and all the other elements that will need to be in place.”",
            "He notes that additional investment is needed in R&D so that drop tests can be conducted on the flasks and process like that will be ramped up as part of this drive to get SMRs built, shipped and deployed.",
            "Chaplin continues: “For molten salt reactors reactors, heat pipe technology or those that will use HALEU fuel, for example, we need to get regulations in place and that can be a frustrating and very slow process where consensus is needed.” However, overall Chaplin is optimistic. He concludes: “SMRs are such a broad and diverse church, but they are coming at a great pace and we are a lot further along than I thought we would have been in just five years. It feels like it’s a monumental task but, like a snowball rolling downhill, it seems to be gathering pace. As more people understand the need for this and also the challenges, I think the faster it will be. There has been talk of deployment of some SMRs using molten salt reactors in the early 2030s. I wouldn’t like to say it’s not going to happen. I think that it’s easily achievable as long as momentum stays there.”"

        "title": "Expanding tails management",
        "text": [
            "Urenco has taken the next step in its plan to increase production capacity. (Credit: URENCO)",
            "Uranium enrichment company Urenco has taken the next step in its plan to increase production capacity with a contract for its Tails Management Facility (TMF) expansion in the UK. Comprising of a number of associated storage, maintenance and residue processing facilities, the Tails Management Facility (TMF) is used to convert depleted uranium hexafluoride (UF6), known as tails, into stable uranium oxide (U308).",
            "Richard Stephens, who is leading the overarching Capex programme that includes the TMF expansion, explains: “In the new form it meets standards for things like non- proliferation and reducing dust. It’s about responsible nuclear stewardship and being able to store it in the correct form and for possible reuse at a later date.”",
            "Urenco has awarded a contract to engineering firm Bechtel for the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) to expand the TMF so it is capable of processing greater volumes in response to anticipated growth in demand and, in turn, greater need for processing of tails.",
            "Driving capacity expansion",
            "Behind the decision to expand the TMF are several growth drivers that are reaching across the nuclear fuel supply value chain. They include the climate crisis and energy security concerns in light of the conflict in Ukraine.",
            "Although there is no shortage of enriched fuel in the industry currently, these factors have resulted in a greater demand for nuclear energy, and therefore enrichment services. Urenco has taken the decision to expand its production under its so-called capacity programme plan based on market forecasting and customer demand as more governments put stable policy frameworks in place that are in favour of nuclear energy. The plan will enable Urenco to deliver increased capacity at all four of its uranium enrichment sites that are located in the UK, the Netherlands, the USA, and Germany. Managing tails is part of that process.",
            "“We’ve seen the market change over the last couple of years. It’s important to say that we see that companies and utilities around the world are looking more and more towards nuclear power as a green energy source, and a sustainable one at that, so we do anticipate an increase in our services to a market where previously utilities may have not been using nuclear power,” says Stephens, adding: “If you look at the Emirates, for example, there are new entrants to the global sector. We expect to see other countries enter the nuclear arena too. That potentially gives us an increase to our enrichment services to those particular utilities or countries and we want to be available and ready to service those needs.”",
            "Not only does Urenco envisage increasing customer demand as more countries and utility companies turn to nuclear energy but also opportunities as existing nuclear interests seek to diversify their sources of nuclear fuel. Stephens outlines just how dramatic the changes in the nuclear sector have been: “We were an organisation that until around February of last year was looking at perhaps being a smaller organization by 2030 in relation to the fact that nuclear power wasn’t seen as a sustainable path forward and from 2011, the Fukushima incident made the enrichment market a little bit less. There was a bit of an oversupply in the market and there were less new builds and there was less call for SWU services. However, since the conflict in Ukraine and the climate crisis has really come to the fore and with energy security concerns around the world, more and more countries and energy companies are turning to nuclear and seeking a diversity of their supply of nuclear fuel. That’s where we come in.”",
            "Increasing enrichment in light of a potential uptick in demand, chimes in with the company’s capacity programme, which includes refurbishment of existing capacity as well as expansion and build out. Urenco’s first capacity expansion is to be at its US site in New Mexico. The project, announced in July this year, will see multiple new centrifuge cascades added to the plant. According to the company, new commitments from US customers for non-Russian fuel underpin this investment, which will provide an additional capacity of around 700 tonnes of SWU per year, a 15% increase. The first new cascades are scheduled to come online in 2025 and the expansion will be fully online by 2027.",
            "Stephens explains: “Urenco is very much committed to strengthening energy security around the world and that’s been in question over the last two years. We’ll do this with our capacity programme which is about refurbishment of our existing facilities and centrifuges, but also expanding those with new facilities. This capacity programme is a really important part of how we deal with our tails, how we deal with creating new product.”",
            "He adds: “LIke any owner of a manufacturing facility, we have aging equipment and we are replenishing that with new. With regards to refurb, it is no less complex or difficult. However, if you imagine we would over time replenish or refurbish some of our centrifuges, they do get old, some of them break down and that’s what the refurbishment campaign does, but it’s done over a sustained period of time and it’s at higher volumes than what we’ve done in recent decades.”",
            "Referring to the Capenhurst TMF Stephens says: “We’re talking about an extension to an existing facility using the same technology that we have on kilns one and two. It’s purely an extension project it’s not new technology.”",
            "Nonetheless, the new facility will see some limited updates. “When you buy engineered packages, systems and technology, they tend to become obsolescent over time but, essentially, we’re buying a very similar technology. The [existing UK] Tails Facility has been in operation since 2021 and finished construction in 2019.”",
            "However, he emphasises that while there are some limited upgrades any changes only represent incremental improvements: “Our capacity programme is more of an evolutionary step than a revolutionary step. We’re replacing old existing centrifuges with new because they have an end of life. There are some certain 2.0 pieces that we have included, but they’re more around energy demand. They use much less electricity than they did before and they’re part of the continuous improvement efforts that we do. As an organisation that has agreed and signed to the climate pledge, part of what we do is look at how we can reduce our existing energy demand. Everything that we do is towards being a sustainable organization, meeting our net zero pledges, but also being good nuclear stewards.”",
            "Indeed, Urenco is responsible for the safe and secure storage of tails for enrichment at a future date at enrichment sites or deconversion and the TMF is used for all Urenco’s tails it’s obligated to deal with or dispose of. As Stephens says: “Converting it to a safe form for storage and for reuse at another date is how we manage tails and we’re obligated to do that as the enricher. Everything that we enrich we have to take nuclear stewardship responsibility for that.” This excludes sites in the USA where the US Department of Energy is obligated to manage tails.",
            "The TMF expansion is a substantial undertaking, effectively doubling tails management capacity, as Stephens notes: “We’ve got two kilns so we’ll at least double the amount of volume that we do now when we bring kilns three and four on online. Considering the amount of SWU we do a year, we take responsibility for the tails but not all of that will be done at TMF. We can store tails as well at our enrichment sites, for example. We have licences with the respective regulators that permit us only to store a certain amount. That’s why we have to do that processing work.”",
            "“By expanding our Tails Management Facility from two to four kilns, it’ll enable us to process greater volumes and because we’ll be increasing our enrichment process we’ll have tails. We will take care of the end product of our enrichment services. That’s what TMF is designed to do,” Stephens adds.",
            "Responsible nuclear stewardship is a clear strategy for Urenco. The company is already planning to site a Waste Metals Facility (WMF) at Capenhurst to manage metal waste product and residues as part of the programme to refurbish and renew plant across the company. Work has begun on further design activities, safety case development, preliminary waste acceptance criteria and procurement of long-lead items.",
            "As part of the capacity programme, Urenco is also looking to increase staff numbers to match. “We are currently ramping up in our capacity expansion efforts to bring the necessary people into the organisation,” says Stephens.",
            "Like much of the nuclear industry, that is potentially problematic but, according to Stephens, Urenco has managed the process quite effectively: “I think initially the sheer numbers of people looked daunting from the outset. However, when you do your project management and your programme management and you divide your integrated schedules and then you overlay when the projects are going to be actually executed, you have a demand curve and that demand curve is broken down by various disciplines,’ he explains, adding: “What we’ve done is gone to market with a reasonable and responsible demand curve and we haven’t had as many problems as perhaps some others for two reasons. One, because we knew what we needed and when in terms of people and disciplines and numbers and where to deploy them. And then, secondly, the narrative around what we do is rather interesting to a lot of people in the market.”",
            "Stephens expands on this theme: “For one thing, we have a outlook of a programme that’s over 10 years. It touches on new technology, existing technology, and also looks at next gen fuels. The scope of what we’re doing is so vast and so wide that any engineer would get rather excited to be involved in numerous programmes like that. The experienced engineers get to touch on many different programmes and new technologies. For younger engineers we offer is working in different regions because we’re a global organisation. But the true one thing is that what you design on paper you can actually go and touch because, as you design it, we’re actually building the facility behind you. Not many engineers get the chance to do that, especially in the early parts of their career, so our offering is very unique compared to other companies in the market.”",
            "He also points to a comprehensive knowledge transfer programme that supports the business: “We looked at retirees. Although we’ve got an ageing workforce, we’d already taken that into account before the capacity programme came into existence. So again, we haven’t seen the dips of retirement as other companies may have. We’re constantly regenerating and bringing people in of younger years. Although we’ve got this big opportunity in front of us, recruitment is something that we’ve always done. We’re just now doing that at a greater frequency and a bigger number. Shifting gears is not that difficult for Urenco. We’re an agile business that knows when we’ve got challenges and opportunities ahead of us that are achievable. We have a lot of knowledge and we have a good knowledge transfer programme for when those people do leave us and they pass on their legacy to other people in the organisation,” he says.",
            "The FEED stage for the TMF expansion is expected to take approximately 18 months to complete while the facility is scheduled to be completed in about seven years. Bechtel were chosen following a robust procurement process. “Bechtel have the capacity, they have the capability, they have a global reach, they come with pedigree and we want to be with a partner that can work with us. Bechtel have demonstrated their abilities to compliment us as an organisation so they’re very much part of our partnering community,” says Stephens.",
            "In terms of the next steps, although the agreement for the FEED has only just been signed, the Bechtel team are already mobilising. “We know who the key people are and have been working with them for quite some months,” notes Stephens.",
            "For any kind of capacity investment to be sustainable the industry needs stable policy frameworks as well as new customers and new demand. “The reason why [the capacity programme] has already started is because we have got those in certain countries. The USA is where most of our customers are and we have some new contracts there so the expansion is underwritten. We have new customers in Europe as well. Again, we have been underwritten by new customer contracts,” comments Stephens.",
            "Indeed, earlier this year Urenco signed a new agreement for enrichment services to supply one of the two units at the Kozloduy nuclear power plant in Bulgaria. Kozloduy is state owned and the deal supports Bulgaria’s objectives to diversify their nuclear fuel supply chain. Urenco joins Cameco, Uranium Asset Management (UAM) and Westinghouse with the agreement seeing Urenco’s enrichment facilities in Europe receive natural uranium (UF6) from Cameco and supply enriched uranium for fabrication into nuclear fuel rods by Westinghouse.",
            "The original TMF at Capenhurst was a billion-dollar investment and the expansion will bring a further multi- million investment as well. As Stephens concludes: “This is us being serious about our capacity programmes, expanding the amount of SWU we do in terms of energy security and we’ve had to back that with the investment in something which deals with our tails as a result of that enrichment.”"

        "title": "France plans to construct an additional eight EPR reactors",
        "text": [
            "France’s Minister for Energy Transition, Agnes Pannier-Runacher, in an extensive interview with La Tribune Dimanche, said a new draft law on energy security will propose construction of eight more EPR reactors in addition to the six already planned.",
            "“It is a question of getting France out of its dependence on fossil fuels, which represent more than 60% of the energy we consume. My ambition is to lower this figure to 40% in 2035,” she said. The text sets ambitious targets for the deployment of nuclear and renewables. “It breaks with the previous programming law, which reduced the share of nuclear power in the electrical mix to 50% by 2025 [the date was amended to 2035 in 2019]”, she noted.",
            "“The text gives pride of place to nuclear power by asserting the intention to deploy eight EPR reactors in addition to the six already announced, without setting a specific target on the share of renewables by 2030. It takes nuclear power beyond the first six EPRs since the historic park will not continue for ever.” She noted that the technology was not specified in the text but said it is a question of committing, after 2026, to construction of an additional 13 GWe “which corresponds well to the power of eight EPRs, without engraving in marble this or that technology”.",
            "She stressed the need to have a minimum base of controllable energies, in particular nuclear, hydraulic, biomass, or storage. “These sources of energy do not depend on weather conditions, unlike wind and solar. The final goal is to produce more electricity than we consume. This is where renewables need to be massaged.”",
            "Asked about the Flamanville EPR under construction in France, which is 12 years behind schedule, she noted that this is “probably the largest industrial project in the last 50 years”. She added: “For several years, we have been working to strengthen the industrial excellence of our SMEs [small & medium enterprises] and ETI [ethical trading initiative] and develop training to recruit 100,000 people within 10 years. All of this will be essential.”",
            "On the possibility of the draft law being blocked in parliament, she said consensus was possible. “I have already passed two bills with large majorities. I want to confront political groups with their responsibilities and avoid postures. If we agree to decarbonise energy and ensure security of supply at the most competitive price, there is no reason not to find a compromise.”",
            "A bill organising the merger of the France’s nuclear regulatory agency ASN, (Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire) and its technical arm, IRSN (Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire), will be debated in the Senate in early February. This project was reworked in early 2023 and remains controversial. Asked whether this was merger really necessary, Pannier-Runacher said she strongly believed that the reform will lead to greater safety efficiency. “Today, when the ASN and IRSN are faced with a new problem, such as corrosion on a pipe, they have to negotiate a protocol to agree on how to deal with the subject. Bringing them together into a single entity will bring fluidity without changing our security requirements.”",
            "The topics to be discussed at the forthcoming Nuclear Policy Council (NPC), meeting, she noted will address the issue of nuclear fuel recycling infrastructure, “which represents hundreds of millions of euros of investment”. This is a key issue to reduce waste and remain sovereign over the entire nuclear cycle, she stressed. “We have to make decisions; building new capabilities is part of our options. In addition, decisions on small modular nuclear reactors, beyond the financial support of France 2030, could be taken. Finally, we will discuss research programmes and our international strategy.”",
            "On international activities, she said she planned to visit the Czech Republic and India. “The idea is to strengthen our partnership by relying on Czech industry to increase our European reactor production capacities. We will also take stock of the 14-country nuclear alliance and discuss the next nuclear summit scheduled for March.”",
            "She added that India and the Czech Republic “are two countries where EDF hopes to win contracts for the construction of reactors, but competition remains strong, especially against the American Westinghouse” However, she remained confident in EDF's export capabilities.",

In 1996-98 a fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In June 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies – four fixed and one follower assembly – in Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to the Loviisa NPP in Finland which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The NOVA E-3 and NOVCA designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006. However, in 2007 Loviisa decided to switch back to Russian fuel. After failing to extend the Loviisa fuel contract and failing to win any other VVER-440 delivery contracts, Westinghouse decided to withdraw from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and design development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "Loviisa’s current fuel agreement with the TVEL is valid until the end of the current operating licences of the plants two units in 2027 and 2030. In spring 2022, Fortum applied for a new operating licence for both units until 2050, and announced that a tendering process would be arranged for fuel supply for the next operating licence period.",
            "Fortum had announced in November 2022 that it had signed an agreement with Westinghouse Electric Company to deliver a new fuel type for Loviisa. However, the introduction of new fuel is a multi-year project that requires regulatory approvals. Efforts to develop new design VVER-440 fuel restarted in 2014 in face of the demand for increased security of energy supply in Europe. Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe, and was granted €2m ($16.5m) in 2015 to launch the ESSANUF programme, which ran until 2017. Development continued and in early 2023, Westinghouse and Enusa agreed to manufacture VVER-440 fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain. The following September the first test assemblies were loaded at Ukraine’s Rivne NPP.",
            "According to its report to the Ministry, Fortum will tender for fuel production after 2027/2030. Meanwhile the agreement with Westinghouse and the fresh TVEL fuel in stock will ensure Loviisa’s fuel supply. In addition, Fortum announced that it is investigating the possibilities of another Western fuel supplier developing VVER-440 fuel in order to improve the security of fuel supply and strengthen competition. Most likely this could be France’s Framatome, which recently signed a fuel supply agreement with Hungary, which also operates VVER-440s. The Ministry said it will continue to monitor the availability of fuels.",

The bottom head, with an inner diameter of more than 39 metres and a height of 11.5 metres, is the base of the steel containment vessel. It is made up of 64 arc-shaped steel plates welded together. The total lifting weight was about 850 tonnes, including supporting short columns, studs, attachment plates, and penetrations.",

Phase 1 will comprise two units. Lianjiang is the State SPIC’s first coastal NPP in Guangdong Province. It is expected to run in conjunction with hydrogen plants and power storage stations in the area as part of an integrated energy base. It will be China’s first NPP to have a recirculating seawater cooling system super-large cooling towers.",

        "text": [
            "US-based Westinghouse has signed an agreement with Ukraine on the purchase of equipment for the expansion of Khmelnitsky NPP. The agreement was signed by Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko, nuclear utility Energoatom President Petro Kotin and Westinghouse CEO Patrick Fragman. “We have signed an important contract for the supply of reactor island equipment for the Khmelnitsky NPP power unit 5, which will be built using AP1000 technology.” Kotin said. “I consider this to be a milestone event in the development of the domestic nuclear industry. This will be the first-ever non-Soviet (by origin) power unit to be built by Energoatom in Ukraine. It will have a power over 1,100 MWe with a safe and reliable Generation III+ nuclear reactor.”",
            "This is the latest stage in a process that started in 2021 during the visit of the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the USA. “I am grateful that we are supported by the Government and the Ministry of Energy in making those decisions that allowed Energoatom to conclude this agreement,” Kotin added",
            "After signing joint memoranda with Westinghouse (in 2021 and 2022) on the construction of initially five, and later nine units using Westinghouse AP1000 technology, Energoatom embarked on pre-design and design work and a draft of a feasibility study was prepared. During subsequent negotiations, “quite favourable conditions were obtained for the supply of equipment, which is already manufactured and ready for delivery,” Energoatom said. The equipment had been manufactured for two new units at the US VC Summer NPP being built in South Carolina before the project was cancelled in the wake of Westinghouse filing for bankruptcy.",
            "“This will allow us to significantly speed up the construction of Khmelnitsky 5. We will not have to wait at least three years – this is the term for the manufacture of such equipment to order – and stand in line with other Westinghouse customers,” Kotin commented. Khmelnitsky's first reactor was connected to the grid in 1987, but work on three other reactors was suspended in 1990. Construction of the second reactor restarted and it was connected to the grid in 2004,but units 3&4 remain uncompleted. Energoatom said that, once the Verkhovna Rada (parliament) passes the necessary legislation for the construction of NPPs using AP1000 technology, Energoatom will begin construction works at the site for unit 5. During construction, up to 9,000 new jobs will be created. The total construction cost is expected to be around $5bn.",
            "Kotin and Fragman also held discussions on a range of issues following the contract signing. These included current cooperation between the companies and “the loading of nuclear fuel manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Sweden AB with participation of Energoatom’s experts into a VVER-440 reactor at Rivne NPP”. Kotin said he “rated highly” the quality of the US fuel loaded into Rivne NPP unit September, 2023. Kotin also spoke about establishing an assembly line for nuclear fuel in Ukraine. He said: “Ukraine is continuing licensing to enable industrial production of its own fuel assemblies based on Westinghouse technology.”",
            "Rivne units 1&2, commissioned in 1980 and 1981, are the only VVER-440 units in Ukraine. Ukraine also operates 13 VVER-1000 units, including Rivne 3&4 and Westinghouse has been supplying VVER-1000 fuel to Ukraine since 2005, when the first lead test assemblies were delivered to unit 3 the South Ukraine NPP, although the switch from Russian TVEL fuel had its problems. During trial use at South Ukraine NPP in 2012, some fuel became deformed causing significant damage to the reactor and Ukraine later suspended its use pending a redesign. Following Ukraine's change of government in 2014, the contract was revived and extended and the VVER-1000 fuel was structurally modified and modernised.",
            "Over the past several years there has been growing pressure from the European Union (EU) for member states to diversify away from the use of Russian-supplied fuel. Westinghouse Electric Sweden, is leading the Accelerated Programme for Implementation of Secure VVER Fuel Supply (APIS), which was launched in January. There are currently over 30 reactors of VVER-440 and VVER-1000 design operating in the EU and in Ukraine.",
            "In July the EU selected a consortium led by Westinghouse to develop and deliver a secure, fully European nuclear fuel supply for Russian-designed VVERs. The three-year APIS project is co-funded by the EU, using €10m ($10.9m) from the Euratom Work Programme 2023-2025. APIS, part of the EU's Horizon Europe programme for research & innovation, involves 12 partners from eight countries. The race is now on to develop an alternative to TVEL’s VVER-440 fuel. Finland had sourced fuel from Westinghouse (then part of BNFL) for its two VVER-440 units at Loviisa from 2001 to 2007, but decided to switch to TVEL. Westinghouse then shut down its manufacture of VVER-440 fuel and has rushed to redesign it in collaboration with Spain’s Enusa. A production line for the new fuel at Enusa’s Juzbado factory is being developed and Ukraine is trialling the fuel at Rivne.",
            "During the discussions, Fragman emphasised that cooperation between Westinghouse and Energoatom would continue and expand. He said establishment of the joint Energoatom-Westinghouse engineering centre in Ukraine would support bilateral work.",

            "A joint statement from President Yoon and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said: \"The two leaders recognised the role nuclear energy can play in enhancing energy security, combatting climate change and reaching carbon neutrality, and agreed to maintain and further develop bilateral cooperation on nuclear energy topics such as construction and operation of nuclear power plants; workforce development; nuclear fuel; safety; and innovation of gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors, small modular reactors and other advanced nuclear reactors.\"",
            "South Korea’s industry ministry said it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Dutch Economic Affairs ministry to support the new plant order. KHNP signed a memorandum of understanding with the Netherlands’ Economic Affairs & Climate Policy Ministry on the feasibility study.",
            "The Dutch government said in a statement that KHNP will begin the feasibility study in January. The study will consider whether the reactor design complies with Dutch legislation and regulations, whether it can be fitted into the preferred location at Borssele. It will develop a more detailed estimate of the costs and time required to build the two new units. The possible impact on the environment will also be investigated. The study is expected to last at least six months.",
            "The government said similar contracts with US Westinghouse and EDF \"will follow soon\". It added: \"These studies are necessary to determine whether it is technically possible and safe to build new nuclear power stations at the preferred location in Borssele,\" it said. \"An independent party will then evaluate the technical feasibility studies. The first results are expected to be shared in the autumn of 2024.\"",
            "The Netherlands’ only operating NPP at Borssele was built in the 1970s and is due to be decommissioned in 2033. In 2022, the Netherlands announced plans to build two reactors by 2035, taking nuclear’s share of generating capacity from 3% to 13%. MOTIE said South Korea would participate in any bids for new nuclear plants, the Korean Times reported.",
            "The ministry said: “We have agreed to cooperate in the entire cycle of the nuclear power sector, including construction and operation of nuclear power plants, supply of equipment, development of technology such as small modular reactors, education and training, fuel and safety and to establish a joint operation committee between the two governments to build a mutually beneficial partnership.”",
            "President Yoon said in a statement: \"Based on the nuclear power plant cooperation MOU … we will actively support Korean companies with the world's best construction competitiveness to participate in the new nuclear power plant project in the Netherlands.\"",

The latest agreement is with Terrestrial Energy, signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish.",
            "This followed previous agreements with US-based small modular reactor (SMR) and micro-reactor developers X-energy, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), TerraPower and Westinghouse Electric as well as with UK-based developer of molten salt nuclear technology MoltexFLEX.",

ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "Terresrial is developing an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant. The IMSR is a 442 MWt per Core-unit (IMSR400) small modular molten salt fuelled, graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactor. Terrestrial Energy has developed a two-unit configuration which can deliver 884 MWt/390 MWe. The design features a completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers and shutdown rods all mounted inside a single vessel – the IMSR core-unit. The sealed core-unit is replaced completely at the end of its useful service life (nominally seven years). This allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. Terrestrial says it operates at the high temperature required for broad industrial relevance with transformative economic potential.",
            "ENEC and Terrestrial Energy will collaborate to focus on the potential of IMSR plant for electricity generation and for large-scale industrial heat applications. These uses include the IMSR plant’s role in decarbonising energy-intensive and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The parties will also consider frameworks for development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications in the UAE and other markets.",
            "H.E. Mohamed Al Hammadi commented: “We are committed to exploring the latest technologies in advanced reactors as we continue to rapidly decarbonise the power sector through clean electricity from nuclear energy…. We look forward to close collaboration with Terrestrial Energy as we identify the potential deployment of IMSR technology in the UAE and overseas.”",
            "Simon Irish said the IMSR has immense potential to support industrial growth and decarbonisation. “Terrestrial Energy’s prioritisation of national and international regulatory requirements supports the aims of our MOU as does the IMSR’s use of nuclear fuel at standard enrichment levels, which has long-established international acceptance. We look forward to working with ENEC to accelerate development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications and commercial markets.”",
            "In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against Canadian regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.",
            "The conventional nuclear power plant fuel used by the IMSR – Standard Assay Low Enriched Uranium – is the only fuel available and transportable today for civilian reactor use and has international regulatory acceptance. Its use supports an early deployment path for IMSR plants across multiple markets. In August 2023, Terrestrial Energy signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a UK-based subsidiary of Westinghouse, for the design and construction of an IMSR fuel pilot plant."

            "Six small modular reactor (SMR) designs have been selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK – are those considered most able to deliver operating reactors by the mid-2030s and support the UK’s ambitions to reach 24 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Gwen Parry-Jones, CEO of Great British Nuclear, explained: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029.”",
            "The SMR competition is part of a plan for the UK to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy. A nuclear power revival is a central plank of that strategy and the companies through to the next stage will be invited to bid for government contracts later this year. The winning bidders are expected to be announced in spring next year and contracts are due to be awarded in the summer. Announcing the initial tranche of winning entrants, UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: “Small Modular Reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.”",
            "EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited are the companies that have been chosen for the next stage of the process. Key design details and developments are outlined below:",
            "EDF’s NUWARDTM is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor with an integrated primary loop producing 340 MWe from two independent reactors rated at 170 MWe each or 540 MWth. The two units will be housed in a single building and will share common equipment where possible.",
            "According to EDF, the design is focused on standardisation, modular manufacturing and simplicity for in-factory mass production, and flexibility in the construction and operation phases. Furthermore, the design has been developed to support load following and adapted for non-electric uses. With a design availability of around 90%, the fuel cycle is two years and the service life is 60 years. The core features 76 fuel assemblies.",
            "In March this year, EDF created the NUWARD subsidiary in line with its objective to achieve first nuclear concrete in 2030 for its reference SMR plant in France. After finalising the conceptual design, NUWARD is now shifting to the basic design phase.",
            "The NUWARD subsidiary will continue to work with historic partners CEA, TechnicAtome, Naval Group as well as new partners Framatome and Tractebel who were onboarded last year. Tractebel will be responsible for the civil engineering preliminary studies and the evaluation of costs, for example.",
            "Earlier this year EDF submitted the NUWARD design to France’s Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority), marking the start of the pre-licensing process while in June 2022, EDF announced that the design would be the case study for a European early joint regulatory review led by ASN with participation from Finland’s Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB).",
            "Renaud Crassous, NUWARD’s President said: “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the NUWARDTM SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030”.",
            "According to EDF’s SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years.",
            "GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR generating 870 MWth that is based on a larger BWR that is already licensed and operating. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is a Generation III+ reactor certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. The SMR version, the BWRX-300, uses natural circulation and passive cooling isolation condenser systems as well as fully passive safety systems. It’s fuel enrichment, averaging 3.81% and with a 4.95% maximum, puts it firmly in the realms of conventional commercially available fuels and it has a design refueling cycle of 12-24 months as well as a 60-year operational design life.",
            "The construction technologies incorporated into the design adopt advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques that have been proven in the oil and gas, tunneling and power industries. As a result of this approach and using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, GE Hitachi suggests the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in as little as 24-36 months while also achieving an approximate 90% volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW it should also account for around half the amount of concrete. As with other SMR designs, the BWRX-300 claims a cost-competitive approach that can be deployed for both electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating.",
            "An advanced reactor, GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 sets itself apart from other SMR designs with its proven, less complicated attributes and anticipates the design will be deployable globally as early as 2029 thanks to proven know-how and innovative construction techniques. Launched in 2017, the SMR is the 10th evolution of the BWR light water reactor design from GE.",
            "The design has achieved some notable success. This year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to explore the construction of multiple advanced nuclear reactors including proposals for a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site, starting with a plant design and an NRC license application with a view to potentially getting an operational SMR at the site around 2032. Meanwhile, last year Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) selected the BWRX-300 for single-unit project that was initially anticipated to begin operating as early as 2028.",
            "Holtec’s SMR-160+ small modular reactor is a PWR that uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The design, which has been in development since 2010, features a reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components that are located underground, as well as a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down or dissipate decay heat. A key part of the SMR-160 roll-out as envisioned by Holtec is to deploy the reactor as a replacement for the boilers found in coal-fired power stations and reusing the majority of the existing assets. The use of multi-stage compressors that are capable of uprating SMR-160’s steam (700 psi @ 595 Deg F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant are a critical part of this plan. Furthermore, the ability of the SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure also opens new development opportunities, such as using high-pressure steam for industrial applications.",
            "Having been shortlisted, the aim is to start construction of the first UK SMR-160 unit as early as 2028 and Holtec intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s in serial production by 2050 across the UK, amounting to 5.1 GW.",

            "Holtec has a collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C from late 2021 that will see Hyundai perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction. The reactor will be initially manufactured at Holtec’s Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus in Camden, New Jersey.",
            "The SMR-160 design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "More recently, Ukraine’s nuclear generating company Energoatom signed a cooperation agreement that envisions implementation of an SMR-160 pilot project with targeted grid connection by March 2029. The deal further contemplates up to 20 additional SMR-160 units in Ukraine and a manufacturing facility.",
            "The NuScale SMR is a PWR dubbed the NuScale Power Module. This a small PWR is designed to generate 77 MWe at 250 MWth and with be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGRTM SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. It will use standard light water reactor fuel and is the only small modular reactor to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As with other SMR designs, the NuScale Power Module was developed to supply electricity but also potentially generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications. The design features passive operating and safety systems and the modules are submerged in a pool built below ground level.",
            "NuScale SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries and the first project is expected to begin operation in 2029 in Idaho. NuScale has already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components and, in May, South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility began producing forgings for the first VOYGR-6 power plant to be built for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",

Romania aims to be the first country in Europe to deploy a VOYGR SMR and earlier this month Romania’s National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities approved the Licensing Basis Document for the NuScale design.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWth. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK where it has completed the first phase and is expected to complete the second step by July 2024.",
            "Commenting on the shortlisting, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce SMR CEO, said: “We have the only SMR technology in a European regulatory approval process, putting us almost two years ahead of any of our competitors. Securing a domestic contract is vitally important to unlock the enormous global export potential of our clean energy technology.”",
            "This year Rolls-Royce SMR and Sumitomo Corporation completed a joint feasibility study which shows the reactor could offer a significant advantage for the production of low-carbon hydrogen when cost, availability and carbon emissions are taken into consideration.",
            "The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finnish power company Fortum to explore opportunities for the deployment of SMRs in Finland and Sweden. Last year Fortum began a two-year feasibility study to explore necessary conditions for deployment of SMRs.",
            "A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs and expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s. Rolls-Royce is also discussing deployment of its SMR with the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and the Netherlands.",
            "The Westinghouse AP300TM small modular reactor is currently the only SMR based on a licensed, operating nuclear reactor design. Launched in May this year, the design is derived from the operating AP1000 PWR which makes it unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks. It is an advanced, Generation III+ single-loop pressurised light water reactor.",
            "It utilises the same engineering, components and supply chain as the AP1000 which Westinghouse says will thus enable streamlined licensing and leveraging of available technical skills. The company adds that the advantageous economics of the AP300 are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development. Four AP1000 units are operating in China with a further six under construction and one is operating at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, USA, while a second is nearing completion there. The simplified, modular, ultra-compact nuclear island also reduces construction costs and schedule, Westinghouse says. For these reasons the company argues that it is confident that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "The AP300 SMR features advanced passive safety systems designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown condition without operator action, back-up power or pumps and has an output of 300 MWe from 990 MWth.",
            "Commenting, Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO said: “We look forward to this opportunity to demonstrate that the AP300 SMR is the best option for the UK.”",
            "Earlier this year Westinghouse Electric Company and Finland’s Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the possibilities for the development and deployment of AP300 reactor projects in Finland and Sweden. This deal was followed by a similar MoU agreement with Slovak state-owned nuclear company JAVYS and another with Ukraine’s Energoatom.",
            "The successful development of SMRs could completely transform how nuclear power stations are built and result in billions of pounds of investment in the UK and elsewhere. The flexibility of design means that SMRs could also play a significant role is decarbonising hard-to-reach sectors like chemicals, building materials and other energy-intensive industries. Although six companies’ designs have been shortlisted for the next phase of the UK competition, much will depend on a successful roll out of the winning designs, not just in the UK but much further afield too. SMRs clearly offer much promise but the success of SMRs will also mark a key breakthrough for nuclear technology more broadly."

            "Poland's Climate & Environment Ministry issued decisions-in-principle for the construction at six locations of BWRX-300 small modular reactors (SMRs). A total of 24 GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy BWRX-300 reactors are planned for the sites.",
            "Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) in April shortlisted seven locations in Poland for further geological surveys to host SMR plants based on GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy's BWRX-300, for which it holds the exclusive right in Poland. The locations were: Ostrołęka, Włocławek, Stawy Monowskie, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Nowa Huta, Tarnobrzeg Special Economic Zone and Warsaw.",
            "OSGE then submitted applications to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for decisions-in-principle on the construction of SMRs all those locations except Warsaw.",
            "The Ministry’s decisions-in-principle for the six locations is the first step in the process of administrative permits for investments in nuclear power facilities in Poland. This entitles OSGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "Rafał Kasprów, President of OSGE’s Management Board announced the decisions during the Net Zero Nuclear forum at the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai. \"The decisions enable us to launch a programme to build a fleet of BWRX-300 reactors in Poland to provide zero-emission, stable energy sources for the energy, industry and heating sectors,\" he said.",
            "GE Hitachi, BWXT Canada and Synthos Green Energy (SGE) in December 2021, signed a Letter of Intent to cooperate in deploying BWRX-300 SMRs in Poland. OSGE – a joint venture between chemical producers SGE and PKN Orlen applied to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency in July 2022 for the assessment of the reactor design.",
            "However, the Climate Ministry’s positive decision has been thrown into doubt after the Internal Security Agency (ABW – Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego) issued a negative opinion on the plans, according to Polish media. Polityka weekly reported that the ABW noted that the Climate Ministry is required to obtain the ABW’s opinion as part of its assessment of the nuclear project.",
            "While ABW’s opinion is not binding, a negative assessment makes it unlikely the Ministry would approve the SMR plans, according to industry news service Energetyka24. OSGE confirmed that the ABW had issued a negative opinion but issued a statement strongly objecting to the agency’s assessment. OSGE accused ABW of being “incompetent and irresponsible” in the context of Poland’s increasingly urgent need for an energy transition away from coal. It also called for the agency’s reasoning for its decision to be declassified.",
            "“In the course of more than 230 days of proceedings, the ABW did not once meet with either the applicant, OSGE, the technology supplier, US-based GE-Hitachi, or see the data on the proposed locations,” company said in a statement. “We do not know on what basis ABW issued its opinions.” OSGE said its requests to declassify ABW’s reasons for its opinion had been rejected and that it would pursue the case further in court. “We are convinced that these are neither substantive nor professional reasons.”",
            "Business Insider said the negative ABW decision was known in the Ministry and to OSGE at least a month ago, both of which had appealed against it. Business Insider's unnamed source officials at the Ministry of Climate repudiated ABW’s opinion which reportedly concerned the technology itself. Pressed for are consideration of the decision, ABW issued a negative opinion for the second time, Business insider noted.",
            "Reporting on the dispute, TVN24 Business cited OSGE as saying:",
            "\"The world is moving towards both large and SMR nuclear technologies, as confirmed by the current COP28 global climate conference. To achieve the goals of decarbonising Polish energy, many state and private investments are needed.” The company insisted that it had been \"transparently\" conducting the process of implementing technology from the beginning. ABW had provided \" neither substantive nor professional reasons\". OSGE added “will continue its licensing, environmental and location activities related to the construction of the BWRX-300 fleet for the needs of Polish industry, heating and energy\".",
            "TVN24 also received a statement from ABW, which said, as a public authority it “acts only on the basis and within the limits of law”. Minister and Coordinator of Special Services Mariusz Kamiński defended the ABW decision accusing OSGE of “manipulations and lies”. He added: “Before issuing an opinion, the Agency conducts a multi-element opinion procedure aimed at assessing the impact of the indicated investment on the internal security of the state.\" With respect to the application submitted by OSGE, “it should be noted that in the opinion of ABW, the investment carried out by the company unduly protects the interests of the Treasury, including Orlen”. He insisted that the activities of ABW were aimed at \"soundly safeguarding the interests of the Republic of Poland, and were conducted in accordance with the regulations and maintaining the highest standards\".",
            "These developments come amid uncertainty about what is going to be the next government's stance on nuclear energy, following elections in October. Opposition leader Donald Tusk is hoping to lead a coalition government of three opposition groups. His statements indicate that he is in favour of large-scale nuclear. “Nuclear power plants are essential. We are out of time,” he said in November. However, according to PAP, his view on SMRs is less clear. Commenting on the OSGE-ABW dispute he noted that “this civil war” between state institutions “on such an important issue must raise concern”. He criticised Orlen and the government for ignoring the ABW’s concerns and pushing ahead with the plans.",
            "Earlier, the Ministry of Climate & Environment issued decisions-in-principle for the construction of two large nuclear power plants: one for a 3750 MWe plant in Pomerania using Westinghouse's AP1000 technology, the other for a plant comprising two South Korean-supplied APR1400 reactors in the Patnów-Konin region. A decision-in-principle was also issued for copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź SA's plan to construct a NuScale VOYGR SMR."

The latest agreements are with US-based small modular reactor (SMR) developers X-energy and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) as well as with UK-based developer of molten salt nuclear technology MoltexFLEX.",
            "Earlier at COP28 ENEC signed three agreements with US SMR and micro-reactor vendors – GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), TerraPower and Westinghouse Electric. The agreements came after ENEC launched its ADVANCE programme, in the run up to CO28, aimed at leveraging the UAE’s experience in successfully delivering the four-unit Barakah NPP, constructed in Abu Dhabi by a South Korean consortium. ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "The MOU with MoltexFLEX was signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and MoltexFLEX CEO David Landon in the presence of British Ambassador to the UAE Edward Hobart and representatives from the UK government. Under the MOU with a joint working group will be set up to examine the commercial viability of deploying MoltexFLEX's 60 MWt/24 MWe FLEX molten salt reactor in the UAE. The FLEX reactor design – a thermal neutron (moderated) version of Moltex Energy's stable salt reactor technology – was launched by Moltex Energy subsidiary MoltexFLEX in September 2022.",
            "ENEC and MoltexFLEX will assess using FLEX reactors for a range of industrial applications including desalination, hydrogen production and electricity generation. “We will also explore opportunities throughout the Middle East and beyond, which is aligned with MoltexFLEX’s vision for global deployment of the FLEX reactor,” Landon said.",
            "ENEC’s MOU with USNC seeks to jointly explore commercial development of USNC's Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) energy systems and paves the way for potential commercialisation of the MMR in the UAE, USNC said. Further areas of collaboration within the UAE include workforce and supply chain development and project delivery, along with a potential framework for ENEC to lead MMR deployments across the region in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and other areas covered by the Three Seas Initiative. Dr Francesco Venneri, USNC Founder & CEO said the MMR “will play an important role for Emiratis as the nation continues towards deep decarbonisation hand-in-hand with prosperity for Emiratis and other nations across the region”.",
            "The MMR features the high temperature helium-cooled MMR unit providing up to 45 MWt of heat, delivered into a centralised heat storage unit which can combine the heat from one or more reactors. Electric power or superheated steam can then be extracted from the storage unit for various uses. USNC has also developed and patented its own TRISO-based, additively manufactured FCM fuel for use in the MMR.",
            "The MOU with X-energy, signed by Al Hammadi and X-energy CEO Clay Sell will see the two parties work together to assess technical design and commercial viability of X-energy's nuclear technologies for the UAE market, to meet the growing demand for clean electricity generation, along with generating steam, heat and hydrogen to decarbonise industry. The companies will also evaluate potential project partnerships for developments in the UK and Europe and will develop a regional deployment framework for ENEC-led projects in the Middle East, Africa, and Indian subcontinent, X-energy said.",
            "X-energy is developing the Xe-100 pebble bed high-temperature gas reactor as well as proprietary TRISO-X tri-structural isotropic encapsulated particle fuel. \"Our partnership will explore the many ways we can combine X-energy's leading technology with ENEC's delivery expertise to address a broad range of decarbonisation challenges in the region and around the world,\" said Sell.",
            "The statement on the MOU said the agreement also helps advance the US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and aims to help catalyse $100bn in clean energy and decarbonisation projects by 2035. A White House fact sheet noted that PACE “intends to tap available resources and public and private sector expertise in the US and the UAE and expedite investment in and deployment of new technologies to drive down cost”. PACE also “supports the full-scale implementation of the civil nuclear cooperation between the US and the UAE. The three earlier MOUs with GEH, TerraPower and Westinghouse also cited PACE as the context for their co-operation with ENEC, indicating the key role of the US in the signing of these agreements.",
            "In March, ENEC had also signed a letter of intent with the US Idaho National Laboratory (INL) as a basis for discussions regarding INL working with ENEC on clean molecule generation systems that could be deployed at the Barakah NPP such as hydrogen, ammonia, oxygen, water and steam, with the long-term view to export clean hydrogen and ammonia to meet growing global demand. INL also announced its intention to partner with ENEC on its Net-Zero Nuclear platform at COP28.",
            "Relations with the US were also strengthened during COP28. An MOU signed between the UK Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) and ENEC paved the way to “explore potential collaboration opportunities in the deployment of large-scale nuclear reactors, in addition to advanced nuclear technologies (including small modular reactors), as well as a host of related fields, from nuclear security to the supply of nuclear fuel”. ENEC and DESNZ will also share lessons learned in project delivery of large-scale reactors, as well as efficiency improvements, best practices in government and commercial project financing, and site and technology selection. Al Hammadi noted that the Net Zero Nuclear summit was “the perfect platform to sign and agree on new areas of cooperation with trusted partners as we collectively work towards faster climate action”.",

        "text": [
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing. (Credit: 2427999 from Pixabay)",
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing as the recent energy crisis and climate change concerns are allowing nuclear generation to experience something of a renaissance. According to IAEA forecasts, by 2050 the global nuclear power plant fleet will more than double its current capacity: from almost 380 GW now to 873 GW. However, the Agency notes that the increase will be largely achieved through nuclear technologies that are now just being developed and tested, including those which involve the use of novel fuels.",
            "Today, about 30 companies from two dozen countries produce nuclear fuel for land-based reactors. The total volume of nuclear fuel production capacity is not so large – about 20,000 tonnes per year. The three largest producers – French company Framatome, US-based Westinghouse and Russia’s TVEL – supply approximately half of this total production volume.",
            "In recent years many of these producers have accelerated their activities in the field of development of novel fuels. At the same time, the current diversity of technical reactor concepts implies an equal diversity of fuel types. As part of these developments, particular attention is being paid to new accident tolerant fuels (ATF).",
            "The development of ATF has become a priority for fuel designers over the last decade, notably in response to an analysis of the causes of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant which included the zirconium-steam reaction that takes place at temperatures above 1200 °C. There are currently two key pathways to develop ATF technology: to reduce the amount of zirconium in the fuel assembly or to modify the chemical composition of the fuel so that the heat transfer rates of the fuel increases. While it cannot be said that the use of novel fuels will prevent all possible accidents the development of ATF is designed to provide more response time in the event of a rare emergency, as well as to obtain technological and economic advantages during normal operations of the nuclear reactor.",
            "The creation of novel fuel is currently being carried out by all the largest manufacturers as well as other significant players in Europe, the Americas and Asia.",
            "Changing cladding and composition",
            "At present the main ATF efforts of developers are aimed at creating new materials for both cladding and fuel composition. One of the more promising possible solutions is the development of cladding coatings that include chromium in one form or another. Chromium coatings on zirconium alloys provide increased corrosion and wear resistance, as well as reduced hydrogen permeability, which helps maintain the ductility of zirconium alloys. Another option that requires further study, but is potentially interesting for the production of cladding, is composite materials based on silicon carbide.",
            "A universally preferred coating technology has not yet been identified; various manufacturers use different options that they find most suitable. According to Fedor Vysikailo, a professor at the Department of Theoretical Physics at Moscow State University, complex application methods have a high technological, but low economic efficiency.",
            "The methods of heavily doping the surface have the same problem. More promising, according to Vysikailo, are laser application methods. Scientists also note the attractiveness of magnetron methods for coating fuel rods (high application speed and uniformity of coating).",
            "For fuel compositions, options are also being considered that include the addition of chromium or molybdenum, as well as the use of silicides or uranium nitride instead of uranium oxide. New fuel compositions also include doped uranium dioxide (UO2), high-density fuels (eg, U3Si2), and metallic fuels, such as uranium-molybdenum.",
            "Like Westinghouse, Framatome is focused on developing composite-clad fuels. In the long term, the company plans to develop a SiC/SiC composite cladding and Cr2O3-doped uranium dioxide fuel. Currently, Framatome is preparing to manufacture a novel molybdenum-uranium (U-Mo) fuel to extend the life and safe operation of the Forschungsreaktor München II (FRM II) research reactor in Germany and has recently received approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to apply the company’s suite of Advanced Codes and Methods to operating conditions with uranium 235 enrichments above the industry standard of 5%.",
            "The activity of American developers in the area of novel fuels could be partly explained by the aging of the local nuclear fleet – approximately half of the existing units will reach the end of their design life before the mid-2030s and with them the status of the US as one of the world’s largest nuclear fuel importers.",
            "Much of the activity the surrounds novel nuclear fuels is focused of high enrichment low assay uranium (HALEU) which can reach enrichments of up to 20% U235. For example, Centrus is notably beginning first-of-a-kind HALEU production at its American Centrifuge Plant cascade located on the Department of Energy’s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) reservation in Piketon, Ohio. According to Dan Leistikow, VP of corporate communications at Centrus, that will be the first new US-owned and US-based technology enrichment plant to start production in 70 years. Centrus’ demonstration project will only deliver an initial 20 kilograms of HALEU before the end of the year, but the company has plans to scale up to 900 kg of annual production starting in 2024.",
            "According to analysts, that will create certain conditions for the beginning of mass production of HALEU in the US, but only in due course.",
            "At the same time another US-based generating company, Southern Nuclear, has announced that it has also received permission from the US NRC to use advanced nuclear fuel enriched with uranium 235 to 6% at the newly commissioned Vogtle nuclear power plant. This is the first time a US commercial reactor has been approved to use fuel enriched above 5%.",
            "Particular hopes are also being raised by the novel nuclear fuel which is being produced by the American-based Lightbridge Corporation. This fuel is reportedly rapidly gaining popularity in the US and some other Western countries.",
            "In case of Russia’s Rosatom and its fuels subsidiary TVEL, the production of novel nuclear fuel is expected to be launched on the basis of Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) loctaed in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory. That will be a mixed oxide uranium-plutonium MOX fuel, that will be used for the world’s most powerful multi-purpose fast neutron research nuclear reactor, the MBIR, with an output of 150 MWth. The reactor is being built at the site of the Rosatom Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, in Ulyanovsk region. Commissioning of the reactor is scheduled for the second half of the 2020s.",
            "The capabilities of the MCC make it possible to organise the production of various types of nuclear fuel on its site, while the current MOX fuel which is produced uses depleted uranium and plutonium separated during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from thermal reactors.",
            "Rosatom has also plans to more actively promote its advanced nuclear fuel abroad. As part of this, the company has recently offered its advanced nuclear fuel to extend the Indian Kudankulam reactor cycle from 18 months to 2 years. In general, most analysts believe that Russia has good chances to secure a significant share in the global market for advanced fuels, which is partly due to their ability to access cheaper raw materials.",
            "High temperature reactor fuels",
            "The ever-growing interest in small high-temperature gas reactors reactors (HTGR) and the novel nuclear fuel needed for them has become one of the most obvious trends. At the turn of the 1990s–2000s, Japan commissioned a high-temperature technical reactor (HTTR) with a capacity of 30 MW. The fuel for it is TRISO – uranium microspheres packed in a multilayer cladding of silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon. The main function of the cladding is to retain fission products inside the microsphere and provide mechanical strength. Fuel spheres were placed in tubes, which were assembled into fuel assemblies. Work is underway to further improve the fuel. One option is to replace the silicon carbide in the microsphere cladding with zirconium carbide.",
            "In the US, the production of fuel for HTGRs is being developed by the companies including X-energy, BWXT, and USNC. The state supports R&D on this topic and also invests in the creation of industrial production of such fuel (through AGR, ARDP programs, for instance). In China, the CNNC company is building the HTR-PM project – an HTGR with a capacity of 200 MW. Here microspheres are poured directly into the reactor core in a “pebble bed” technology. This reactor also runs on TRISO fuel. The fuel cores, which are about 0.5 mm in diameter, consist of uranium enriched to 8.9% in a multilayer cladding.",
            "It’s clear that new kinds of nuclear fuels are emerging in response to both a new generation of reactors and new demands for safety and performance. Many of these fuels are still under development but there’s little doubt that novel nuclear fuel is set to become a commercial reality."

Members of the national parliament supported an amendment to the nuclear energy strategy proposed by the government. State Secretary at the Ministry of Energy Attila Steiner noted that Paks, Hungary’s only NPP currently uses nuclear fuel supplied by Rosatom enterprises.",
            "However, to ensure the safety and reliability of its operation in the long term, and also taking into account the ongoing attempts by the European Union to impose sanctions against Rosatom, the government decided to provide options for replacing Russian fuel, if necessary, he explained. For this purpose, national legislation was supplemented with a provision according to which “a nuclear power plant may use new, alternative fuel from another manufacturer, in particular during the period of extending its operating life.”",
            "The Hungarian government intends to extend the life of the Paks nuclear power plant. The current life of the four power VVER-440 units of the station was supposed to end in 2032-2037, but they are now expected to operate at least until 2052-2057. At the same time, the construction of the second stage of the NPP (Paks-II) is underway with two VVER-1200 units being built by Rosatom.",
            "Until 2022, fuel assemblies were delivered to Paks from Russia by rail through the territory of Ukraine, but after the outbreak of armed conflict, the route had to be changed. Now the cargo is transported by ship across the Black Sea under the protection of warships to the Bulgarian port of Varna, where it is loaded onto a train, and then transported through Bulgaria and Romania to Hungary. As a rule, NPPs maintain a fuel reserve for at least two years in advance.",
            "There is currently no alternative to Russian fuel for the four VVER-440 reactors, and the Hungarian government has repeatedly stated that it does not intend to abandon it as long as it can be supplied reliably. Speaking at the meeting, which was broadcast on the parliament website, Steiner noted that only Rosatom enterprises can now produce fuel assemblies for those units, so Hungary is interested in ensuring that they are not subject to sanctions. At the same time, he confirmed that, in accordance with the general policy of the European Union, Hungary will strive to diversify its energy supplies including nuclear energy.",

Two South Korean-supplied APR1400 reactors are planned in the Patnów-Konin region of Wielkopolska province in central Poland. A positive decision by the Ministry of Culture & Higher Education makes it possible to start work at the site and confirms the compliance of the planned investment with the objectives of Poland's energy policy. According to the plan, the two reactors with a total installed capacity of 2,800 MWe will provide 22 TWh of energy annually, which corresponds to 12% of current electricity demand in Poland.",
            "The decision-in-principle is the first step in the process of administrative permits required for investments in nuclear power facilities in Poland. It entitles ZE PAK and PGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "PGE PAK Energia Jadrowa (PPEJ) submitted its application to the Ministry in June. PPEJ is a joint special purpose vehicle set up by Polish public company ZE PAK (Zespól Elektrowni Patnów-Adam-Konin) and Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) – both Treasury owned – to implement the project to construct the NPP in Patnów. The plant will comprise two reactors supplied by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). PPEJ was established just five months after the letter of intent was signed in Seoul in October 2022 between PGE, ZE PAK and KHNP. PGE and ZE PAK will each own 50% of the shares in PPEJ, which secures the interest of the Polish Treasury in the project.",
            "Jacek Sasin, Poland’s Minister of State Assets said energy security is the basis for the functioning of the state, and in view of the challenges related to energy transformation, only nuclear power can provide a stable basis in the coming years to ensure access to cheap and clean energy and support economic development. “The implementation of the project that PGE PAK Energia Nuclear wants to implement together with the Korean side in Pątnów fits perfectly into the plans that the government has in this respect,” he noted. “The issue of a fundamental decision for this draft confirms this. So I hope that the further implementation of this project will not stop or prevent anything.”",
            "Wojciech Dąbrowski, President of the PGE Management Board said the basic decision “is crucial for the construction of a nuclear power plant and allows us to move on to the next stages of the investment”. He added: “We received it less than 13 months after signing the letter of intent. In the case of such a large investment, this is a very good result. It is also proof of the commitment and good cooperation of all partners in the project and confirmation that the ambitious plan to launch the first unit by 2035 is very realistic. The power plant will provide consumers with cheap and clean energy, and Poland, along with renewable energy sources, with energy security and independence.”",
            "This project is developing in parallel with Poland’s official nuclear power programme. Poland has ambitious nuclear power development plans. In September 2021, it was announced that six large pressurised water reactors with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040 to reduce its reliance on coal. Construction of the first 1.0-1.6 GWe plant was expected to start in 2026 for commissioning in 2033. Subsequent units will be implemented every 2-3 years. In November 2022, the government announced the first plant, with a capacity of 3,750 MWe, would be built in Pomerania using US Westinghouse AP1000 technology. An agreement outlining a plan for delivery of the plant was signed in May by Westinghouse, Bechtel and state-owned Polish utility Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe (PEJ).",
            "In April, PEJ had applied to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for a similar decision for the Westinghouse project and in July the Ministry issued a fundamental decision approving the plan. It formally confirmed that investment in Poland’s first NPP is in the public interest and in line with state energy policy.",
            "PPEJ President Jakub Rybicki said in August that he expected the Patnów project to begin operation in 2035. “We are starting negotiations with our Korean partner regarding the feasibility study, agreements on financing our project and the creation of a Polish-Korean company that will directly lead this process,” he noted.",
            "However, currently KHNP is facing a lawsuit filed by Westinghouse in October 2022 alleging intellectual property infringement. Westinghouse insists that KHNP’s APR1400 nuclear reactor is based on Westinghouse technology. KHNP contests this. “After launching its own nuclear programme, Korea gradually built up technology, carrying out research and development projects with long-term plans for over 30 years. Thanks to this process, it gained competence in the design, production and construction of nuclear power plants in order to finally develop her own, independent technology,” the company said.",
            "In the meantime, however, the lawsuit could be an obstacle to export of the APR1400. “The Westinghouse lawsuit has been dragging for a long time and there’s no guarantee of winning the battle,” said Moon Joo-hyun, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University. Westinghouse said in September that it would continue its legal battle against South Korean firms despite a US court dismissing its lawsuit.",

A spokeswoman for USNC confirmed to Northern Journal that her company had made the pre-filing notice but added that a formal protest had not been filed.",
            "The Eielson contract had attracted broad interest from the energy industry. An informational meeting about it last year was attended by a large number of companies, according to a roster published by the military. As well as USNC, these included representatives from Westinghouse, Rolls-Royce and Siemens.",
            "Oklo’s chief executive, Jake DeWitte, said his company is letting the contracting process play out. “But we are more than excited about the opportunity,” he said. The USNC spokeswoman Mary Woollen said USNC is still “extremely interested in providing this solution to the Air Force and (is) waiting for DLA’s contracting officer to notify us of the next steps in the procurement process”.",
            "USNC “believes it is in the best position to support the Air Force and will continue to pursue all means at its disposal to support its bid”, she wrote in Northern Journal.",
            "Oklo is developing the Aurora microreactor, which uses heat pipes to transport heat from the reactor core to a supercritical carbon dioxide power conversion system to generate electricity. It will use HALEU fuel. Oklo says the reactor builds on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) and space reactor legacy. EBR-II features a hexagonal fuel element with a sealed heat pipe and a passive air-cooling system. Oklo initially marketed a 1.5 MWe microreactor version of the Aurora, but has now expanded its capacity offerings from 15 MWe to 100 MWe.",
            "Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), in August announced updates to the design of its Gen IV gas-cooled microreactor with fuel developments with a tripling of power output. The company’s Micro-Modular Reactor design can operate at various power levels from 10 MWt (3.3 MWe) to 45 MWt (15 MWe) and can work with either HALEU (19.75% enrichment) or LEU+ (9.9% enrichment). USNC is in pre-licensing engagement with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission and with the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission in Canada through the Global First Power joint venture with Ontario Power Generation.",
            "At the time of the August announcement, the Air Force said the micro-reactor was expected to go online by the end of 2027, based on a directive in Congress’s 2019 military spending bill. DLA’s McCaskill said there is no revised timeline to the contracting process and that the agency still intends to meet all deadlines.",

        "title": "Philippines and US sign nuclear co-operation agreement",
        "text": [
            "The Governments of the Philippines and the USA signed an “Agreement for Cooperation Concerning Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy” also known as a Section 123 Agreement, on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in San Francisco, California. The US insists that countries seeking to trade nuclear power goods and services must sign formal cooperation agreements. Such Section 123 Agreements relate to the relevant paragraph of the US 1954 Atomic Energy Act which requires them.",
            "Philippines Department of Energy (PDOE) Secretary Raphael PM Lotilla signed the Agreement on behalf of the Philippines as Chair of the Philippine Nuclear Energy Programme Inter-Agency Committee (NEPIAC). US Secretary of State Antony J Blinken signed on behalf of the US. The ceremony was witnessed by Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.",
            "The 123 Agreement lays the legal framework for potential nuclear power projects with US providers. It aims to facilitate Philippine-US cooperation in the safe and secure use of nuclear energy taking into full account the standards and safeguards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as in accordance with respective national laws, international agreements, and regulations.",
            "Introducing the signing ceremony, Ann Ganzer, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Department of State’s Bureau of International Security & Nonproliferation, said the agreement “marks the culmination of negotiations between our governments launched less than one year ago”. She added: “Once in force, this agreement will provide the legal basis and facilitate US exports of most nuclear equipment and materiel to the Philippines for peaceful uses.”",
            "Blinken noted: “President Marcos has set an ambitious goal: cutting the Philippines greenhouse gas emissions by 75% by 2030 and increasing the production of clean energy so that 50% comes from renewable sources by the year 2040. The United States is committed to working with the Philippines so that it can meet those targets – using platforms like the very first US-Philippines Energy Policy Dialogue, which we hosted in Seattle back in August.”",
            "He continued: “With the Philippines’ leadership, we’re also working together to develop a nuclear energy sector in their country to fuel a reliable, secure, and affordable clean energy future. As peak energy demands are expected to nearly quadruple in the Philippines by 2040, nuclear power can consistently produce enough energy to meet communities’ critical needs without emitting more greenhouse gases. In a nation of more than 7,000 islands, small modular reactors … can generate energy locally and conveniently. Nuclear energy will also create inclusive economic opportunities for American and Filipino businesses alike, and good-quality, high-paying jobs in both of our countries.”",
            "The agreement will enable the US to share equipment and material with the Philippines, he added. “Already, we’ve organised workshops, we’ve hosted exchanges on these topics with American and Filipino researchers, officials, business leaders – to help train local experts and to share some of our best practices,” he said, adding “there’s a lot of work that remains ahead to turn this vision into concrete reality”.",
            "In his address, Philippines Secretary Lotilla recalled that a decade after the first atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima, the Philippines in 1955 joined the US Atoms for Peace programme. Building on this foundation, the Philippine Atomic Energy Commission was established in 1958 and in 1963 a pre-investment study was initiated for a NPP in Luzon. A new Philippine-US agreement for civil nuclear cooperation was signed in 1968, replacing the 1955 agreement. This, for the first time, explicitly referred to the design, construction, and operation of power-producing reactors and research reactors. The Philippine congress then approve the Atomic Energy Regulatory & Liability Act.",
            "In 1971, the National Power Corporation was authorised by law to establish and operate NPPs after which a NPP was built but never operated. “The Philippine decision was nevertheless followed by an orderly and safe cessation of activities. More importantly, the 1987 Philippine constitution remained open to all peaceful uses of nuclear energy,” he said.",
            "President Marcos said he had earlier called for the re-evaluation of the possibility of safely developing nuclear energy in the Philippines, “recognising the enormous potential of nuclear energy given the new highly advanced technologies and standards of safety, security, and all the different safeguards that are now in place”. He added: “We see nuclear energy becoming a part of the Philippine energy mix by 2032, and we would be more than happy to pursue this path with the United States as one of our partners.",
            "Under the Philippine Energy Plan, Manila plans to produce 1,200 MWe using nuclear power by 2032, which would increase to 2,400 MWe by 2040 and to 4,800 MWe by 2050. The effort to revive nuclear power in the Philippines was begun by Marcos’s predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, who was in power from 2016 to 2022 and whose relations with the US were somewhat strained.",
            "However, last year, Washington and Manila signed a memorandum of understanding on civil nuclear cooperation that included reviving the mothballed Bataan Nuclear Power Plant, a 620 MWe pressurised light water reactor built by the US Westinghouse in 1976. Although the plant was completed it was almost immediately mothballed in the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster after questions were raised about its excessive cost and poor safety, including its location near a major fault and the Pinatubo volcano.",
            "Separately from the 123 Agreement, Marcos Philippines electric company Meralco, which provides electricity in the Manila area, signed a deal during APEC with the US-based Ultra Safe Nuclear Corp (USNC) for a pre-feasibility study on Micro-Modular Reactors (MMRs). The agreement builds on the partnership between the two companies announced in August.",
            "Meralco Chairman & CEO Manuel V Pangilinan said “USNC is changing the nuclear safety and national energy security conversations in the Philippines with the MMR. This cooperative agreement moves us forward with a partner who understands these important issues alongside the essential nature of the cost and reliability of the electricity supply.”",
            "Under the agreement, USNC will conduct a four-month pre-feasibility study to familiarise Meralco with MMR systems and how these can be effectively utilised in the Philippines. Depending on the results, Meralco has the option to conduct a more detailed feasibility study with focus on the adoption and deployment of MMR energy systems.",
            "USNC’s MMR Energy System features a high temperature helium-cooled micro reactor that can provide up to 45 MWt of high-quality heat, delivered into a centralized heat storage unit. One or more MMR nuclear batteries combine their heat in the heat storage unit, from where electric power or superheated steam can be extracted through conventional means to meet a wide range of power requirements. USNC has also developed and patented its Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel planned to be used in the MMR.",
            "USNC in a pre-licensing process with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) through Global First Power (GFP), USNC’s joint venture with Ontario Power Generation, and with UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The news follows recent announcements including the establishment of a joint venture with Framatome Inc. to manufacture commercial quantities of advanced nuclear fuels, selecting a site for its MMR Assembly Plant, and the successful delivery of advanced TRISO fuel for NASA produced at USNC’s Pilot Fuel Manufacturing facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "“Meralco is demonstrating real leadership in advancing the energy security and sustainability roadmap for the Philippines,” said USNC founder & CEO Francesco Venneri. “Our MMR nuclear batteries can play a major role in delivering those benefits. The plans that will quickly follow this study place Meralco well on the way toward creating a reliable, low-carbon, equitable and secure future for Filipinos.”",

            "Brookfield owns a 51% interest in Westinghouse and Cameco owns remaining 49% interest. (Credit: Westinghouse Electric Company LLC)",
            "Canada’s Cameco has announced that acquisition of Westinghouse Electric Company in a strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management alongside Brookfield Renewable Partners and institutional partners has been completed. Cameco now owns a 49% interest and Brookfield a 51% in Westinghouse.",
            "Tim Gitzel, President & CEO of Cameco, said that, since first announcing this deal a year ago, “we believe the business prospects for Westinghouse have significantly improved”. He added: “The sustained and positive momentum for nuclear energy has been undeniable as countries and companies around the world strive to meet their net-zero commitments and growing energy needs through clean and secure supply.”",
            "Westinghouse said: “The sale to Brookfield and Cameco cements the significant role that Westinghouse plays in enabling the world’s clean and secure energy goals and will further support Westinghouse’s development and growth. Brookfield’s global leadership across carbon-free energy technologies further positions Westinghouse and nuclear power in the clean energy transition worldwide. Cameco brings deep experience in the front-end fuel cycle, complementing Westinghouse’s robust capabilities in fabrication and services, and further enhancing security of nuclear fuel supply globally.”",
            "Westinghouse President & CEO Patrick Fragman said Westinghouse “is strategically positioned with Brookfield and Cameco to leverage expertise in our respective areas to better serve our customers and achieve a carbon-free future”",
            "Cameco’s 35 years of experience in uranium mining and nuclear fuel production combined with Brookfield’s expertise in clean energy is expected to provide a solid foundation for Westinghouse’s continued success in the provision of nuclear plant technologies, products and services, and to create a powerful platform for strategic growth across the nuclear sector, according to Gitzel",
            "The total enterprise value of $7.9bn was adjusted for working capital balances at the close, resulting in a final enterprise value of $8.2bn, Cameco reported. Westinghouse has $3.8bn in outstanding debt commitments, for which it maintains responsibility after closing and which reduces the equity cost of the acquisition.",
            "To finance its 49% share of the purchase price, valued at $2.1bn, Cameco used $1.5bn in cash and drew the full amount of both $300m tranches of the term loan put in place concurrently with the execution of the acquisition agreement, and which mature two years and three years from the date of close. The $280m bridge commitment that was secured concurrently with the acquisition agreement was not required to complete the transaction and has been terminated.",
            "“The mix of capital sources to finance our share of the acquisition was chosen to preserve our balance sheet and ratings strength while maintaining healthy liquidity,” Cameco said. “We expect to maintain the financial strength and flexibility to execute on our strategy and take advantage of value-adding growth opportunities, while navigating by our investment-grade rating and self-managing risk.”",
            "Gitzel said priorities over the coming weeks will include Cameco and Brookfield conducting the first Westinghouse board meeting focused on its strategic business plan. He noted that Cameco also has a number of international commitments to fulfil over the next month and, once those commitments have been fulfilled, Cameco will host a virtual investor day on 19 December “to further discuss the exciting business prospects we see moving forward for Westinghouse”.",
            "Cameco said it expects the acquisition to enhance its participation in the nuclear fuel cycle “at a time when there is tremendous growth on the horizon for our industry”. Cameco is enhancing its ability” to compete for more business by investing in additional nuclear fuel cycle assets that we expect will augment the core of our business and offer more solutions to our customers across the nuclear fuel cycle”. Cameco noted that Westinghouse “has nuclear assets that are strategic, proven, licensed and permitted, and that are in geopolitically attractive jurisdictions”.",
            "Westinghouse also “has a long-term contract portfolio, which positions it well to compete for growing demand for new nuclear reactors and reactor services, as well as the fuel supplies and services needed to keep the global reactor fleet operating safely and reliably”. This helps protect Westinghouse from macro-economic headwinds as utility customers run their critical nuclear power plants. “Its durable and growing business is expected to allow Westinghouse to self-fund its approved annual operating budget, to maintain its existing capacity to service its annual financial obligations from de-risked cash flows, and to pay annual distributions to its owners,” Cameco said.",
            "However, Westinghouse has a long, and somewhat chequered history dating back to its founding in 1886 by George Westinghouse, originally named “Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company”. It was renamed “Westinghouse Electric Corporation” in 1945. Following financial difficulties and acquisitions in the 1990s, its Power Generation Business Unit was sold to Siemens of Germany in 1997 and a year later its commercial nuclear power businesses were sold to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL). Certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Company, which was then sold to Japan’s Toshiba in 2006.",
            "Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017 in the face of extensive financial difficulties. The filing affected only its US operations, which included projects to build four AP1000 reactors – two each at Vogtle in Georgia, and the VC Summer site in South Carolina. In 2018, Brookfield Business Partners (together with institutional partners collectively known as Brookfield) agreed to acquire 100% of Westinghouse from Toshiba for about $4.6bn. Brookfield completed the purchase in August 2018. This marked Westinghouse’s exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a restructured company."

The welding of the second new segment of the pipeline in the valve room in the containment has been completed, NEK said. The quality of the welds was confirmed by non-destructive methods. “With this, the replacement of pipelines was completed and preparations for restarting the power plant began.”",

We plan to synchronise the generator with the power grid in mid-November.”",
            "The Krško plant is co-owned by Croatia’s Hrvatska Elektroprivreda (HEP) and Slovenia’s GEN Energija. Krsko NPP, located in Slovenia near the border with Croatia, generates some 40% of Slovenia’s electricity output.

        "text": [
            "Belgium, Italy and Romania have formed a consortium with US-based Westinghouse Electric to develop a small modular lead-cooled fast neutron reactor (SMR-LFR). Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in the presence of Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who was on an official visit to Brussels, and representatives from the Italian and US embassies in Belgium. The organisations taking part in the project, along with Westinghouse, are: Italy’s Ansaldo Nucleare and National Agency for New Technologies, Energy & Sustainable Economic Development ENEA (Agenzia nazionale per le nuove tecnologie, l'energia e lo sviluppo economico sostenibile); Romanian Atomic Energy Technology Company RATEN (Regia Autonoma Tehnologii pentru Energia Nucleara); and Belgian nuclear research centre SCK CEN.",
            "“A year and a half ago, we took the strategic decision to accelerate our energy transition… by investing massively in offshore energy, hydrogen infrastructure, but also the nuclear power of the future,” said de Croo. “We decided to do this by drawing on the expertise developed in Belgium, and by allocating $100m ($106.8m) to the research and development of small modular reactors,” he added.",
            "The agreement provides the basis for negotiations on a future cooperation agreement to accelerate the development of SMR-LFR. “The technology needs to be developed to a level that allows the commercialisation of reactors that are more secure, economically competitive and contribute to the transition to a clean energy system,” Romania’s Presidential Office noted. \"The phased demonstration of the LFR technology will require the construction and operation of experimental support facilities and demonstration reactors,” the Presidential Administration said.",
            "The new MOU is just the latest stage in joint research, which has been underway for more than 10 years. Ansaldo Nucleare coordinated Euratom’s project ELSY (European Lead cooled SYstem) from its start in 2006. The goal was to develop an innovative pre-conceptual design of an industrial lead-cooled fast reactor for electricity production based on a closed fuel cycle. Following ELSY’s completion (2010), in the frame of EU 7th framework programme, Ansaldo became the leading organisation and coordinator of the LEADER project (Lead-cooled European Advanced DEmonstration Reactor). The LEADER project aimed to develop a conceptual design of a Lead Fast Reactor Industrial size plant (the European LFR – ELFR) and of a scaled demonstrator of the LFR technology called ALFRED (Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator).",
            "In 2019, Romanian utility Nuclearelectrica signed a MOU with the Fostering ALfred CONstruction (FALCON) consortium for cooperation on ALFRED, which was planned for construction in Romania. FALCON had been established in 2013, comprising ENEA and Ansaldo Nucleare, as well as Romania's RATEN-ICN, and later CV-Rez. In 2017, the consortium members decided to   renew  the consortium, reaffirming their objectives.",
            "A 300 MWt demonstration ALFRED unit is expected to be built at RATEN-ICN's facility in Mioveni, near Pitesti in southern Romania, where a fuel manufacturing plant supplies fuel for Romania’s Cernavoda NPP. ALFRED is to prepare the way for a 300-400 MWe industrial demonstration unit, featuring passive safety systems, which will use mixed-oxide (mox) fuel and operate at temperatures of around 550°C. The total cost of the project was estimated at some €1.0bn.",
            "Ansaldo Nucleare led the conceptual design of ALFRED as part of the seventh Euratom framework programme. ENEA was responsible for the core design, technological development and safety analyses. The reactor was being developed through the European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative (ESNII), as part of the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan. ESNII was set up under the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform, formed in 2007.",
            "In 2021, consortium comprising Ansaldo Nucleare and Reinvent Energy (Romania) was awarded a contract worth around €20m for the design, procurement, installation and commissioning of the Advanced Thermo-Hydraulics Experiment for Nuclear Application (ATHENA) experimental plant – a research facility for the development of lead-cooled reactors. ATHENA will be built at RATEN-ICN’s Pitesti research centre and will include a 2.21 MWt pool-type plant housing 880 tonnes of liquid lead in a main vessel (3m in diameter by 10m in height). This facility will also house scale components for testing and demonstration of technology for LFR reactors.",
            "The consortium is supported by ENEA and Italian engineering company SRS for the conceptual and executive design of the technological part, as well as by Romania’s Ispe and Somet (for the design of civil works and installation. The project involves the construction of an electrical core simulator, a main pump and a heat exchanger similar to the arrangement of the ALFRED system.",
            "In October 2022, Westinghouse and Ansaldo Nucleare signed a cooperation agreement to develop a next-generation NPP based on LFR technology. The two companies will advance a common design to maximise synergies, combine experience in design, testing and licensing, and align respective partner and supply chain organisations. Westinghouse said the agreement builds upon development activities already underway in the UK, USA, Italy, and Romania, where more than ten state-of-the-art, lead-based test facilities are being installed.",
            "In May, Ansaldo Nucleare and Westinghouse said initial testing had been completed for their LFR design at the Passive Heat Removal Facility recently built at the Ansaldo Nuclear plant in Wolverhampton (UK). The work was performed under a contract within Phase 2 of the Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) programme partially funded by the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS). Under this contract, Ansaldo Nucleare led the design, purchase, installation and commissioning of two experimental facilities -the Versatile Loop Facility (VLF) and the Passive Heat Removal Facility (PHRF), which will collect experimental data supporting accelerated development of LFR technology.",
            "The £10m ($12.5m) UK government investment will enable Westinghouse to test the feasibility of key LFR materials, systems and components. The VLF will test a fuel pin bundle simulator, a compact heat exchanger and a coolant pump, resembling those that will be installed in the reactor coolant system. The PHRF will characterise the passive decay heat removal system of the Westinghouse LFR, producing experimental data for the qualification of computer codes devoted to performance assessment.",
            "Last year, the Belgian government entrusted the task of identifying innovative SMRs to SCK CEN, as well as the search for suitable partners to develop lead-cooled fast SMRs. The newly established collaboration outlined a way forward, based on a gradual approach through demonstration phases. This will start with a small reactor to demonstrate the technological and engineering aspects of commercial SMR-LFR at SCK CEN’s Mol site in Belgium by 2035-2040.",
            "In the meantime, the group will work towards the next development phase, namely the construction of ALFRED in Pitești, focusing on the technical and economic feasibility of future commercial SMRs. This will exploit and expand the work done in the last 10 years to achieve this goal by Ansaldo Nucleare, ENEA and RATEN within the FALCON consortium. The Lead-cooled Fast Reactor project being developed by Westinghouse will be the starting point for this project, aimed at its global marketing. The agreement signed by SCK CEN with Ansaldo Nucleare, ENEA, RATEN and Westinghouse is “the first milestone in this strategy, a solid foundation on which we will continue to build,\" said Alexander De Croo.",
            "Currently all these projects are still in the conceptual and design stages with testing only taking place on non-nuclear components. To date, the only operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029.",

Brookfield and its institutional partners will own a 51% interest in in Westinghouse and Cameco 49%.",
            "The planned acquisition was announced in October 2022 in the wake of increased interest in nuclear power following the energy crisis in Europe sparked by sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas. Westinghouse’s existing debt structure will remain in place, leaving an estimated $4.5bn equity cost to the Cameco-Brookfield consortium, subject to closing adjustments. This will be shared proportionately between Brookfield and its institutional partners (approximately $2.3bn) and Cameco (approximately $2.2bn).",

            "Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov has told a government meeting that construction of unit 7 at the Kozloduy NPP has begun. The statement was broadcast by Bulgarian National Television.",
            "“Today, by government decision, the implementation of the project for the construction of the seventh power unit of the Kozloduy NPP will begin. An additional BLG500m ($274m) will be allocated to the enterprise that will be responsible for the implementation of the project and negotiations will begin with companies involved in the construction of the seventh unit. Completion date if 2033,” Denkov announced.",
            "He added that preparations for the construction Kozloduy unit 8 will also begin. “Because according to the plan, parallel construction should be carried out so that the units are put into operation at intervals of two to three years,” he explained. He clarified that the total capacity of the two units will be 2,300 MWe.",
            "In June, US-based Westinghouse Electric Company signed a Front-End Engineering & Design (FEED) contract with Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild for a AP1000 reactor to be constructed at the Kozloduy NPP site. In March Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild and Westinghouse had signed a memorandum of understanding establishing a joint working group to plan deployment of the AP1000 reactor in Bulgaria. The working group evaluated regulatory, licensing and design requirements and is developing a streamlined execution path in support of Bulgaria’s energy strategy, according to Westinghouse.",
            "In January, the Bulgarian Parliament by a majority vote decided on the need to build two new nuclear reactors (units 7&8) using AP1000 technology at Kozloduy. The decision obliged the Bulgarian government to negotiate with the US government on this issue. In October, the Bulgarian government reversed the decision to build the Belene NPP as a project of national importance and cancelled the procedure for selecting a strategic investor for its implementation.",
            "Currently, Kozloduy NPP operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades.",

            "The Krško NPP, which was shut down in early October after the discovery of a leak in the primary circuit connection system pipeline, could restart in mid-November after repairs, according to operator Nuklearna elektrarna Krško (NEK). Following investigation and analysis, a decision was taken to replace the complete pipeline segment from the reactor vessel to the first valve. Work began after moving all 121 fuel elements from the reactor vessel to the used fuel pool.",
            "The Krško plant is co-owned by Croatia’s Hrvatska elektroprivreda (HEP) and Slovenia's GEN Energija. Krsko NPP, located in Slovenia near the border with Croatia, generates some 40% of Slovenia's electricity output. The 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor, which is some 100 kilometres from the Austrian border, is Slovenia's only NPP.",
            "NEK said Westinghouse with the support of the domestic industry, had begun removing part of the pipeline. In parallel, replacement parts were being prepared. A mock-up was made to train specialised welders, which corresponds to the space next to the reactor vessel where they have to work. NEK noted that, to ensure safe, long-term and early restart it was decided to replace a second pipeline which had been subjected to the same conditions. The first pipeline has been successfully removed and preparations are underway to remove the second and install new pipeline segments.",
            "The Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (UJV – Uprava za jedrsko varnost), which is overseeing the work, explained that, as a preventive measure, the identical branch of the safety injection system's pipeline on the other side of the reactor vessel is being replaced as well, although no coolant leak occurred there. UJV is supervising the work with the help of dedicated Technical Support Organisations (TSOs). Weekly meetings are held involving NPP staff, UJV and TSOs to discuss the repair work as well as safety and technical details. “If the repair works are properly carried out, all the required tests successfully executed, and the appropriate approvals gained from UJV and TSOs, the start-up of the NPP is presumably going to take place in November,” UJV noted.",

US-based Westinghouse, France’s EDF and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) submitted binding bids for Dukovany 5 and non-binding bids for the other three units. Westinghouse is proposing its AP1000, KHNP its APR1000 based in the APR1400 and EDF its EPR1200 (a smaller version of its standard EPR). These are all pressurised water reactors. Russia and China were excluded from the bidding in 2021.",
            "Four VVER-440 units are currently in operation at the Dukovany site, which began operating between 1985 and 1987. Two VVER-1000 units are in operation at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. The Dukovany units will be decommissioned no later than 2045-2047.",

Now we will evaluate the bids and, according to the contract with the state, we will submit the evaluation report to the Ministry of Industry & Trade and then to the Czech government for final approval.”",
            "The bids were submitted electronically using special encryption and a uniquely secure storage. It is expected that the contracts will be finalized within the next year. After the final signing of the contracts, the project documentation will be prepared so that the new unit will be ready for trial operation in 2036, ČEZ said. The new Dukovany unit will be built next to the existing power plant and will replace part of its capacity in the future.",
            "Since the Ministry of the Environment issued a positive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) opinion in 2019, EDU II has received a Siting Permit from the State Office for Nuclear Safety and a Generating Plant Authorisation from the Ministry of Industry & Trade in 2021. A zoning decision for the new units has also recently been issued by the Ministry of Industry & Trade.",
            "The bid submitted by Westinghouse Electric Company, along with construction partner Bechtel, is for one AP1000 unit with the potential for a second unit at Dukovany and two additional units at the Temelin site.",
            "Westinghouse says the AP1000 is “the only operating Generation III+ reactor with fully passive safety systems, modular construction design and the smallest footprint per MWe on the market”. Furthermore, “the Westinghouse/Bechtel strategy of utilizing the local supply chain will increase opportunities for Czech businesses to participate in the new nuclear project”.",
            "US Ambassador to the Czech Republic Bijan Sabet confirmed the US. government’s full support for the Westinghouse/Bechtel bid.",
            "“We see mutual benefits to both the United States and the Czech Republic,” he said. “Westinghouse first partnered with the Czech Republic on nuclear energy three decades ago,” said David Durham, Energy Systems President, Westinghouse. “Together we can lay the foundation for a clean, secure energy future that extends for the next 80 years of operation, and beyond.”",
            "Currently, the AP1000 is not licensed or operating anywhere in Europe. In the USA two AP1000 reactors are under construction at the Vogle NPP in Georgia but are significantly delayed and over budget. Two Westinghouse AP1000 units are in operation at China’s Sanmen and Haiyang NPPs, and two CAP1000 units, the Chinese version of the AP1000, are being built as the second phase of each station. The proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at China’s Lufeng NPP was approved by the National Development & Reform Commission but has not yet received State Council approval. Three AP1000 units have recently been selected in Poland and nine others are planned in Ukraine. Bulgaria has also selected the AP1000 fir its Kozloduy NPP.",
            "EDF’s bid is for one EPR1200 reactor at Dukovany and up to four units in the Czech Republic.",
            "The bid includes supplying engineering, procurement, construction and support to commissioning activities for one EPR1200 reactors at Dukovany (unit 5) including design and implementation activities for nuclear fuel and delivery of fuel assemblies for the project. EDF also proposes support the development of a fleet of reactors in the Czech Republic, based on one additional unit at the Dukovany site (unit 6) and two additional units at the Temelín site (units 3&4).",
            "EDF says it will make use of the know-how and industrial prowess of its subsidiary Framatome to supply the engineering studies and equipment for the nuclear steam supply system and, instrumentation and control. Its historical and trusted partner GE Steam Power will supply engineering studies and equipment for the conventional island, which is to be equipped with the French Arabelle 1000 steam turbine. Bouygues Travaux Publics will supply nuclear new build civil works activities. EDF will identify Czech companies that could be selected as suppliers for the project. It says that, to date, nearly 300 Czech companies have been identified and approximately 90 have begun EDF’s prequalification process. EDF also offers training.",
            "EDF Chairman & CEO Luc Rémont noted: “As the only vendor and builder of third generation nuclear technology in Europe, we believe that the long-term strategic partnership we are proposing will set a precedent for our continent and serve as the backbone for a more resilient and independent European nuclear industry. By joining the European EPR community, the Czech Republic will benefit from a massive fleet effect and create many industrial synergies between our current and future nuclear programmes in France, the UK and beyond.”",
            "South Korea's KHNP is proposing its III+ generation APR1000 which was developed based on its operating OPR1000 reactors but also incorporating safety features of the APR1400, which are in operation in the UAE as well as South Korea.",
            "The European version, the EU-APR, received European Utility Requirements (EUR) certification in 2017. The APR1000 received EUR certification in March.

This relates to three AP1000 Westinghouse reactors with a total capacity of 3750 MWe. This allows Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe (PEJ) to use the area for preparatory activities such as indicating, among other things, specific plots for implementation of the investment.",
            "Earlier, PEJ obtained a basic decision and a decision on environmental conditions for its investment in Pomerania. PEJ also signed an Engineering Services Contract with a consortium of American companies including Westinghouse and Bechtel.",

            "The decision specifies in detail the territorial scope of investments both on land and at sea, and also specifies the conditions for the implementation of investments, including technical, environmental and conservation. The decision “brings us closer as an investor to the start of construction of the facility,” said Mateusz Berger, President of the PEJ Management Board.",
            "The decision is not a building permit and a further permit from the governor will be needed to carry out preparatory work. A construction licence must then be issued by the President of the State Atomic Energy Agency followed by another permit from the governor of Pomerania before construction work can begin.",
            "In December 2021, PEJ (which is wholly state treasury owned) selected the site of the plant near Lubiatowo-Kopalino in the coastal province of Pomerania. Construction is planned to start in 2026 with first reactor scheduled to be operational in 2033. The estimated cost of the investment is more than PLN100bn ($22.74bn). In November 2022, the government announced the first plant, with a capacity of 3750 MWe, would be built in Pomerania using Westinghouse AP1000 technology. An agreement outlining a plan for delivery of the plant was signed in May by Westinghouse, Bechtel and PEJ.",

            "The awards will enable the three companies to advance their microreactor designs through a front-end engineering & experiment design (FEEED) process. that supports developers in planning for the design, fabrication, construction, and testing of fuelled reactor experiments.",
            "“The FEEED process will bring three microreactor designs – Kaleidos [Radiant], Pylon [USNC], and eVinci [Westinghouse – one step closer to reality” said Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr Kathryn Huff. “These technologies will give choices to diverse communities looking to transition to a clean energy future.”",
            "Microreactor designs typically produce 1-20 MWt for use directly as heat or converted to electric power. They are described by their designers as being suitable to power independent microgrids, restore power in emergency situations, or supply remote communities that currently rely on diesel generators.",
            "DOME is being developed by repurposing the Experimental-Breeder Reactor-II containment structure as a new test bed intended to speed up microreactor development. DOE says testing in DOME could start in 2026. DOE is also developing the Laboratory for Operation & Testing in the US (LOTUS) test bed, intended to host smaller reactor experiments to support the development of advanced reactors.",
            "NRIC, launched by DOE in 2020, is developing both DOME and LOTUS and also developed the FEEED process to help industry partners progress more quickly toward first-of-a-kind testing of advanced reactors. NRIC, led by INL, facilitates collaboration between developers and the US National Laboratory System. NRIC says it is “charged with and committed to demonstrating advanced reactors by the end of 2025”.",
            "Above: Radiant’s portable zero-emissions microreactor",
            "California-based start-up Radiant Industries was set up in 2019 by former SpaceX engineers. Its Kaleidos design is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) which will use TRISO fuel, a helium coolant, and a graphite moderator. All components will be fitted in a single shipping container to facilitate rapid deployment. It is designed to produce 1.2MWe or 1.9 MWt for heating or water desalination, as a potential replacement for diesel generators.",
            "Earlier this year Radiant announced that it had raised $40m in a Series B funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, bringing its total capital raised to $54m with an additional $2.3m in government awards. In December 2022 Radiant was awarded a voucher under the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) scheme. GAIN voucher recipients do not receive direct financial awards but provide funding to DOE national laboratories to help businesses overcome critical technological challenges to commercialising their technologies. Argonne National Lab will work with Radiant Ito perform numerical modelling of heat production and removal in its microreactor concept.",
            "Radiant says its primary focus is on a demonstration at INL’s DOME facility no later than 2026 and is targeting commercial unit production in 2028. However, this seems ambitious as the reactor is only in the design stage and so far the only operating HTGR in the world is in China. Regulatory approvals could also prove problematic and there is no guarantee that DOME will be operating by 2026.",

It is designed to be easily transportable to off-grid locations both on Earth and in space: for terrestrial use, the system is intended to fit in a standard container. Pylon is based on USNC’s MMR and Fully Ceramic Micro-encapsulated (FCM) fuel technologies.",
            "The Pylon D1 Demonstration System design, slated for DOME testing, contains a small HTGR with FCM fuel, metal hydride neutron moderator, and graphite control drums. “Pylon D1 uses helium to transfer the fission generated heat through the primary coolant loop to a secondary gas loop (helium, air, supercritical CO2, and other gases) for ejection into the surrounding environment. USNC is planning to use the results of the demonstration to support development of the MMR.",
            "USNC has active micro reactor deployment projects in Canada at the Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Chalk River, in the USA at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and at LUT University in Lappeenranta, Finland and in Poland. Additional projects are under development in the USA, Canada, and Europe. A 15 MWt (5 MWe) demonstration plant is planned for Chalk River. Site preparation and construction is expected to begin in 2025, subject to the necessary approvals, for operation in 2027, which may be optimistic.",

Its small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment, with superior reliability and minimal maintenance, making it suitable for use in remote locations. It will use TRISO fuel. It is one of several advanced reactor designs being supported through DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Project (ARDP) to help accelerate the development and deployment of new reactor technologies.",
            "Westinghouse is also developing its Nuclear Test Reactor (NTR) which it aims to operate by 2026. The NTR will be “one-fifth scale representation” of an eVinci microreactor. Westinghouse says the eVinci technology is 100% factory built and assembled before it and will be shipped in a container to site.",
            "Westinghouse recently announced the launch of a new design and manufacturing facility in Pittsburgh to accelerate commercialisation of the eVinci microreactor.

The EBR-II operated from 1964 to 1994, and was originally built to demonstrate a complete sodium-cooled breeder reactor power plant. It was later modified to test other reactor designs and to test materials and fuels for fast reactors, as well as generating power and heat for the site. The reactor and much of its supporting equipment has been dismantled, but the containment structure remains – 80 feet high with a diameter of 70 feet.

            "All three contracts extend until December 2025. The three companies were selected by NASA in June 2022 for phase 1 studies of fission surface power systems, small nuclear reactors intended to support later phases of the Artemis lunar exploration campaign. Each team received $5m for initial design studies.",
            "The US Department of Defense (DOD) announced that the initiative will allow AFRL to investigate how a “high power, nuclear fission-system could be implemented from a subsystem, spacecraft, and architecture standpoint”. JETSON Programme Manager Lt Col Tommy Nix told a virtual panel at the American Nuclear Society that AFRL aims to research more advanced power options for space projects.",
            "After JETSON is completed, the US Air Force intends its spacecraft to use nuclear fission to harness power instead of solar energy. JETSON will also develop support systems in critical areas, including power management, on-orbit mobility, thermal regulation, and radiation shielding.",
            "According to Nix, JETSON will enable the Space Force to conduct missions beyond geosynchronous Earth orbit, which extends. More than 22,000 miles from the Earth’s surface and is currently the furthest region used by military satellites. “As we move farther and farther out from what our current mission set is, we’ll need higher power to cover the bigger volumes [of space],” he noted.",
            "DOD’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 2021 awarded contracts to General Atomics, Blue Origin, and Lockheed Martin for the first phase of its Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) programme. DRACO aims to develop and place a nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) system above low Earth orbit in 2025.",
            "JETSON is not a nuclear propulsion programme like DRACO. but is focused on developing nuclear power systems that can be used in space. To enable satellites or spacecraft to change position or carry sophisticated payloads more electrical power is required than can be supplied by conventional solar panels or battery-powered systems.",
            "Nix noted that fission reactors can adjust their output, potentially providing the extra power on demand to drive more potent sensors and instruments, eliminating the need for batteries.",

            "The new fuel is supplied by Russian fuel company TVEL. However, Zronek noted that CEZ, the operator of both the Dukovany and Temelin NPPs, is diversifying its fuel suppliers and is also expanding its storage capacity so that the plant can have fuel in stock for almost five years. Earlier this year, CEZ has agreed that future fuel supplies would be provided US company Westinghouse with deliveries expected to begin in 2024.",

        "text": [
            "The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) – Baltimore District has awarded a contract to decommission and dismantle the SM-1A Reactor Facility to Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning (A3D). The standalone C-contract contract estimated to be worth $95.5m over six years will integrate and leverage proven new technologies to dispose of both hazardous and radioactive materials.",
            "Amentum, based in Virginia, is a global engineering, project management and solutions integration company. APTIM, based in Louisiana, specialises in environmental services, resilience, sustainability, and energy solutions, as well as technical and data solutions, programme management, and critical infrastructure.",
            "A3D won the contract after protesting against an earlier decision to award it to Westinghouse. In August 2022, USACE awarded a $103m to Westinghouse Government Services (WGS) for the work.",
            "However, A3D alleged that USACE had misevaluated the WGS proposal and also failed to engage in adequate, equal discussions with the company. In April, the US Government Accountability Office partially upheld the protest and recommended that USACE “eliminate WGS from further consideration for award and make award to one of the remaining firms in the competition, if otherwise proper.” Alternatively, USACE could reopen discussions among the competitors; solicit, obtain and evaluate revised proposals as the basis for its decision. A3D won the contract after lowering its original bid of $133.5m.",
            "“As a global leader in environmental solutions, our experience in nuclear remediation is extensive,” said, of Amentum’s National Security Group President Mark Whitney said Amentum will provide USACE with “advanced engineering capabilities and solutions that have been successful at some of the most challenging environmental cleanup projects in the world”.",
            "David Lowe, Senior Vice President of APTIM’s Nuclear Decommissioning business unit, said, APTIM has a long history of supporting USACE and the Army Reactor Office (ARO) in decontamination and decommissioning projects. “Our extensive experience performing reactor decommissioning projects for USACE and the ARO enables us to bring advanced innovations and solutions to complete the work safely and effectively at Fort Greely,” he noted. “We will partner with USACE , regulators, and community stakeholders to eliminate the environmental liabilities of this legacy, ageing nuclear facility.”",
            "Other members of A3D’s team include Heritage – M2C1 Joint Venture, a HUBZone small business location in Delta Junction, Alaska; Lynden Logistics; Brice Environmental; Oak Ridge Technologies; ReNuke Services; AECOM Technical Services; and Delta Junction Medical.",
            "Under this new contract, the work will be performed at Fort Greely, Alaska and will include planning, permitting, and engineering, site preparation, demolition and disposal of facilities and components from the defuelled nuclear reactor, related wells and utility corridors, and other ancillary facilities. The contract also includes remediation of contaminated soils, a final status survey, and site restoration.",
            "The SM-1A reactor achieved criticality in 1962 and was shut down in March of 1972, followed by the removal and disposition of the used fuel in 1973. The primary mission of the single-loop, 20.2 megawatt-thermal pressurized water reactor was to establish a cold-weather nuclear power plant to support power to Fort Greely, with a secondary mission to study the economics of operating a nuclear electric power plant as compared to operating a conventional oil-fired system in a remote location.",
            "SM-1A was built between 1958 and 1962, and operated from 1962 to 1972. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). 1A designates it as the first field plant of its type. It was designed to be used as an “in-service” test facility in an Arctic environment with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam for the utility systems at Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear-type electrical plant in a remote area where fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "The final shutdown in March 1972 was in accordance with the SM-1A Decommissioning Plan approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health & Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the highly enriched uranium dioxide nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapour container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected to minimise costs and personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was deferred until radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced. In 1995, Fort Greely was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure list (BRAC) under which certain areas were investigated and remediated. The base was then removed from the BRAC list and remained open to support critical Army missions.",
            "The decommissioning strategy developed in the 1970s recommended that the deactivated reactors should be placed into a safe storage mode to allow the shorter-lived radionuclides to decay. Delaying decommissioning was expected to reduce radioactive waste volumes and worker exposures. However, preliminary studies indicated that the levels of contamination present within the reactors would not be reduced by decay sufficiently to allow for release of the facilities without significant decontamination. Additionally, concern regarding the increasing cost and decreasing availability of radioactive waste disposal led the Army Reactor Office (ARO) to reassess disposal options.",
            "USACE developed a management plan for conducting an All Hazards Assessment, which contained provisions for four phases of work. Phase I included a Historical Records Review & Disposal Alternatives Investigation. Phase II included performing a characterisation survey and decommissioning cost estimate, which was completed in 2015. Phases III and IV deal with decommissioning planning, design, and execution. Decommissioning Planning has been completed and USACE has received a Decommissioning Permit from ARO.",
            "The remaining materials that have been entombed in concrete or safely stored onsite will now be removed as part of the contract with A3D. An on-site kick-off meeting at Fort Greely will take place in late October, paving the way for our preparatory work at the site. The team is targeting a full mobilisation to the site by mid-2024. Project completion is currently anticipated by 2029. The site will then be released to the Garrison for future use.",

            "The Belene project envisaged the construction of two Russian VVER-1000/V-466 reactors and preliminary site works began in 2008. Contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers. The plant was to be built by Atomstroyexport (part of Rosatom) after Russia won an international tender in 2006 but the project was cancelled in 2012, after a change of government. It was revived again briefly in 2018 after a series of arbitration procedures, which saw Bulgaria pay €601.6m ($691.5m) in compensation to Atomstroyexport for the equipment already manufactured. These components are now stored at the construction site.",
            "Conservation activities are carried out at the Belene site to ensure that the condition of the equipment is maintained in accordance with the requirements of the manufacturer ZIO-Podolsk. Such maintenance can only be performed by Atomstroyexport with the participation of ZIO-Podolsk specialists. The current technical management contract for the conservation of long-range equipment, signed in July 2021, ends on 31 December 2023. However, this can now be extended in line with the requirements of the Public Procurement Act. A similar derogation was approved in September 2022.",
            "Bulgaria has only one operational NPP at Kozloduy with two Soviet-made VVER-1000 units which are due to be decommissioned in 2027 and 2029. In January, the former caretaker cabinet proposed an energy strategy plan for the construction of four new units to guarantee its energy security – two at Kozloduy and two at Belene. The caretaker government was reportedly due to negotiate the potential construction of plant at Belene with Electricite de France (EDF).",
            "However, following a change of government after the April snap election, the new parliament in July authorised the Energy Minister to start negotiations on the potential sale to Ukraine of the mothballed Belene equipment including two reactors, four steam generators and four circulation pumps. The transaction should cover expenses previously incurred by Sofia in the amount of BGN1.2bn ($644m). Ukraine is considering using the equipment at its Khmelnitsky NPP.",
            "Plans for a new reactor at Kozloduy have been underway since last year resulting in a memorandum of understanding with US Westinghouse Electric on the possible construction of an AP1000 reactor. In June, the two companies agreed to study the potential for Bulgarian industry and infrastructure at the Kozloduy site to support the AP1000 project.",

The plant has reported a series of similar incidents over the past 20 years. Plant owner Dominion Energy said it is planning to improve the reliability of its back-up system. Small cracks have been found a number of times times in the past two decades in pipes that carry fuel to the emergency generators that provide cooling water if electricity fails. NRC has issued a preliminary “yellow” warning to Dominion Energy.",
            "This is the second most serious category and only seven such warnings have been issued in the US since 2009, The State newspaper reported citing nuclear power expert David Lochbaum who has reviewed NRC records.",
            "A crack first appeared on a diesel fuel pipe in 2003, and similar pipes have had other cracks since then. During a 24-hour test of the system in November 2022, a small diesel fuel leak expanded, NRC records show.",
            "The preliminary yellow warning was issued because of the repeated problems. According to The State, Dominion spokesperson Darryl Huger said in an email that NRC’s ruling is not final and the company will have a chance to explain what happened. Dominion has begun work to put in place a plan to improve the reliability of the back-up system and Huger noted that there were multiple back-up systems in case any component fails. He gave assurances that Dominion will continue to keep NRC updated on future strategy to “further enhance our diesel generators”. Dominion has recently requested to renew the licence for the Westinghouse 3-loop 966 Mwe pressurised water reactor for an additional 40 years.",

The problem in one of the reactor’s four pumps was found during pre-operational testing and startup of the unit, which had been expected begin operation later this year. Instead, the reactor now is forecast to begin operations in the first quarter of 2024. The problem with the coolant pump was an “isolated event,” Georgia Power said in a report filed with the US Securities & Exchange Commission. The company has a replacement on hand and is working to replace the malfunctioning pump.",
            "Fuel loading at Vogtle 4 began in August. Unit 3 began commercial operation at the end of July. Vogtle 3&4 are both 1,117 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The two units were originally expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the project; Oglethorpe Power Corp owns 30%; the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) owns 22.7%; and the city of Dalton owns 1.6%. The units will be operated by Southern Nuclear.",
            "News of further delays to Vogtle 4 came one day after the Georgia Power announced it had settled a lawsuit with Oglethorpe Power Corp. The settlement calls for Georgia Power to pay Oglethorpe Power $413m associated with cost overruns on the project, including $308m in construction costs and $113m in projected capital expenses. Oglethorpe sued Georgia Power in June 2022, declaring at the time it was exercising an option agreed to by all four project co-owners in 2018 by capping what it was willing to pay for the project.",
            "As part of the 2018 agreement, Oglethorpe said it would reduce its share of ownership in the Vogtle expansion project from 30% to 28% in exchange for Georgia Power’s paying 100% of Oglethorpe’s remaining share of construction costs. However, under the latest settlement, Oglethorpe has agreed to keep its 30% ownership share and drop the litigation.",
            "“Oglethorpe Power and our members are experiencing growth on our system, so there’s great value in keeping our full Vogtle capacity, especially at a significantly reduced cost,” said Heather Teilhet, Oglethorpe’s senior vice president of external affairs.",
            "“We are pleased to have reached a settlement with Oglethorpe Power in this matter, and that Oglethorpe Power will retain its full ownership interest in these new units,” Georgia Power spokesman Jacob Hawkins added. “We continue to work constructively with all our partners to complete the Vogtle expansion, bringing clean and reliable energy to Georgia.”",

Southern said this milestone underscores the industry’s effort to optimise fuel, enabling increased fuel efficiency and long-term affordability for nuclear power plants.",
            "Southern Nuclear President Pete Sena said nuclear power accounts for almost half of US clean energy, “and Southern Nuclear is committed to pushing for innovative, game-changing technologies like the deployment of Accident Tolerant Fuel that will advance performance and further support our ability to strengthen grid reliability with 24/7 generation”. He added: “Realising the significant role nuclear power plays in our country’s energy infrastructure, I especially want to recognise the NRC’s thorough yet timely review of this installation to support the future of commercial nuclear power in our country.”",
            "In 2022, Southern Nuclear signed an agreement with Westinghouse to load four lead test assemblies (LTAs) with next-generation fuel features into Vogtle 2. The LTAs use key components from Westinghouse’s High Energy Fuel initiative and the EnCore Fuel programme. These features include ADOPTTM uranium dioxide pellets, AXIOMTM fuel rod cladding and chromium-coated cladding combined with Westinghouse’s advanced PRIMETM fuel assembly design. With regulatory authorisation, Southern Nuclear and Westinghouse are moving forward with the manufacturing these first-of-a-kind fuel assemblies with planned installation in early 2025.",
            "“Members of Congress and the Department of Energy have demonstrated their deep understanding of the positive impacts of Accident Tolerant Fuel, and their support has been critical to our ability to advance fuel technology with higher burnup rates,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “We are grateful to Southern Nuclear for their trust and look forward to delivering advanced technologies that will bolster the light water fleet and support the low-cost generation of nuclear power in the long term.”",
            "Authorisation of enrichments above 5 wt.% uranium-235 is part of broader efforts by industry to develop and deploy batch quantities of advanced fuel technologies which are a set of new technologies that enable higher enrichment and have the potential to enhance safety at NPPs by offering better performance during normal operation, transient conditions and accident scenarios.",

The government and GBM said the chosen designs are considered as the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s. The next stage of the process will be launched as soon as possible where successful companies will shortly be able to bid for government contracts. The aim is to announce in Spring 2024 which of the companies the government will support, with contracts awarded by Summer 2024. “This timetable aims to make this competition the fastest of its kind in the world,” DESNZ noted.",
            "The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) competition is part of the government’s plan to revive nuclear power and for the UK to lead the global race to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper energy and greater energy security. The government aims for up to a quarter of all UK electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The statement pointed out that, “as well as backing SMRs and other emerging nuclear technologies, the government is also investing in the large-scale project at Sizewell C, a near exact replica of Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be in construction for over a generation”.",
            "Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said SMRs “will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy for British families and businesses, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and grow the economy”. She added: “This competition has attracted designs from around the world and puts the UK at the front of the global race to develop this exciting, cutting-edge technology and cement our position as a world leader in nuclear innovation.”",
            "Minister for Nuclear & Networks Andrew Bowie said the programme “provides the blueprint for how the government can work together with industry to grow the economy and set the future of new, exciting nuclear technologies”.",
            "Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN CEO, said: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029. These companies will now be able to prepare for the next stages of the competition, aiming for a final contract agreement in the summer, potentially benefiting from significant support from the public purse.”",
            "The government’s objective has been to select technologies which offer the greatest confidence in being able to make a final investment decision in 2029 and be operational in the mid-2030s.",
            "For companies who were not successful in this initial process, the next opportunity could be the government’s consultation on alternative routes to market for nuclear technologies which is due to be launched soon. This will look at how to support newer technologies so that the UK can benefit from them as well.",
            "The government is set to consult later in the year on how best to ensure other nuclear technologies can potentially get underway in the UK – and this could include some of the technologies that were not selected through this process.",
            "The six technologies selected all depend to a large extent on traditional nuclear technology. The 470 MWe Rolls-Royce SMR design is based on a small pressurised water reactor. The design was accepted for UK Generic Design Assessment review in March 2022 and Rolls-Royce SMR expects to receive UK regulatory approval by mid-2024. A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium – which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI – expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.",

            "The company noted that the SMR will also be able to provide energy for the manufacture of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. It will occupy approximately one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear generation site, thereby reducing local ecological impacts. The SMR will be factory built, enabling completed modules to be transported by truck, train or barge, reducing vehicle movements and completion risk and increasing build time certainty.",

GE-Hitachi says it is a cost-competitive solution that can be deployed for electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating. “Using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in 24-36 months while achieving an approximate 90 percent volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW should also account for 50% less concrete per MW – a significant improvement in both affordability and advantageous size.”",

Westinghouse is proposing its AP1000, KHNP its APR1400 design and EDF its EPR1200 (a smaller version of its standard EPR). Russia and China were excluded from the bidding in 2021.",
            "The new deadline is now 31 October. ČEZ said extension of the deadline has no impact on the project schedule. Bidders will submit non-binding bids for another three nuclear reactors in addition to the binding bid for one reactor in Dukovany. The deadline had already been extended from 15 September to 2 October at the request of another bidder.",

            "KHNP filed countersuits claiming that the US Atomic Energy Act grants authority to enforce the law exclusively to the US Attorney General and not to entities seeking to claim rights through litigation.",
            "The Court for the District of Columbia, in dismissing Westinghouse’s suit, accepted the claim by KHNP that a private entity has no authority to sue for the enforcement of the Section 810 of US Federal Regulations. \"The court holds that Westinghouse lacks a private cause of action to enforce Part 810 and therefore has failed to state a claim,\" the ruling said.",
            "However, in his statement, Durham argued that the court had simply ruled that the authority to enforce the regulation lies with the US government, and the decision has no bearing on the ongoing arbitration over the prohibited transfer of Westinghouse’s intellectual property outside the country.",
            "Durham claims that the use of Westinghouse intellectual property outside of Korea is the \"principal\" dispute between the parties. \"The decision has no bearing on the ongoing arbitration proceeding against Kepco/KHNP involving Kepco/KHNP's non-allowed transfer of Westinghouse's intellectual property outside Korea,\" the statement said, according to Yonhap.",

            "The Russian nuclear sector has been steady developing this year, despite the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine and growing isolation of the country in the international arena. In fact, the nuclear industry is one of the few industries in Russia, which – so far – has not been included in the EU and US sanctions lists. This has ensured its generally good level of development in 2022 and the first half of the current year. Still, despite this, further prospects of the industry remain cloudy.",
            "Currently the development of the industry in Russia is mainly carried out within the existing state programme: ‘Development of equipment, technologies and scientific research in the field of the use of atomic energy in the Russian Federation’ (RTTN) – which is designed to run until 2030.",
            "The programme was launched in 2020, being designed by Rosatom together with the National Research Center the ‘Kurchatov Institute’, the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education. Initially, it was designed to run until 2024, but was extended by another six years. The programme consists of five major federal projects.",
            "The first project – ‘New Nuclear Energy’ – is aimed at creating new types of next-generation reactors. Last year, for example, Rosatom completed technical design for the RITM- 200N reactor, which will become the basis for its low-power nuclear power plants (LNPPs).",
            "As part of the second project, work is currently ongoing on the multi-purpose fast neutron research reactor MBIR. It will become the world’s most powerful reactor of its type considering the existing, under construction and projected fast neutron installations. In April 2022, the reactor unit – a unique product 12 m long, 4 m in diameter and weighing more than 83 tonnes – was delivered to the MBIR construction site ahead of schedule. In January 2023, its installation in was completed. Rosatom plans to complete construction works in 2026, a year ahead of the planned schedule.",
            "In the meantime, particular attention is also being paid to work in the field of thermonuclear fusion and plasma technologies. As part of the project, so far, Rosatom R&D enterprises – the State Research Center of the Russian Federation TRINITI (Troitsk Institute for Innovation and Fusion Research) together with AO NIKIET (Research and Design Institute of Power Engineering) – have developed and manufactured an in-chamber protection element for the first wall of the Russian T-15MD tokamak, Russia’s largest thermonuclear plant at the Kurchatov Institute. Under the terms of the project programme on the small tokamak T-11M, located in TRINITI, specialists have conducted experiments to study the effect of injection of finely dispersed lithium on plasma parameters. The technology under development will be used for the design of the Russian Fusion Power Demonstration Reactor.",
            "In the case of TRINITI, recently its scientists have also made progress on the development of a prototype plasma rocket engine. After completion of all works, scheduled for 2024, the institute will produce a prototype engine with increased thrust, they say.",
            "In the meantime, another promising area of development for Rosatom in years to come will involve work in the field of accident tolerant fuel. This was recently confirmed by Viktor Ilgisonis, director of the R&D department at Rosatom. For this purpose, Rosatom plans to accelerate its R&D work in this field with the aim of increasing safety and efficiency of nuclear power plant operation. Among other developments that involves a switch from zirconium as a material for fuel assembly cladding to silicon carbide. Alexey Dub, First Deputy General Director of JSC “Science and Innovations” (management company of “Rosatom’s R&D division) in an interview with Russian Rossyiskay Gazeta business paper said that Rosatom has achieved some progress in this field. “In 2022 we obtained silicon carbide samples with a very low oxygen content as an impurity, which is extremely important for the operation of this material in nuclear reactors. Moreover, we were able to obtain quasi-viscous condition of silicon carbide with the high level of strength and elasticity, which, according to specialists of the High-Technological Research Institute of Inorganic Materials will meet the necessary requirements during the manufacture of shells for the so-called tolerant fuel,” Dub explained.",
            "Currently NII NPO ‘LUCH’, part of the R&D division of Rosatom, is working on the technology for manufacturing products with complex geometry from silicon carbide with dimensions of up to 900 millimeters. “In terms of silicon carbide, we are not just on the highest global level, we are moving faster than foreign competitors,” Dub reportedly noted.",
            "The fifth federal project of Rosatom focuses on the development of technologies for the serial construction of nuclear power units. As part of this programme, the biggest hopes of the company rest with the construction of power units with VVER-TOI reactors. This design is widely considered the basis for Russian exports of nuclear energy technologies in the near future.",
            "The annual volume of investments in the implementation of these plants varies across the range of RUB100-125 bn (US$1.3-1.5 bn), most of which is allocated from extra- budgetary sources.",
            "On a separate note, the company has also plans to continue its developments in the field of nuclear floating plants. Recently Rosatom has made a proposal to establish nine clusters in the Arctic for the extraction of gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc, that will be operated on the basis of energy, produced by floating and small nuclear power plants. In addition, the company plans to accelerate its research in the field of floating power units (OPEB).",
            "According to earlier statements, made by Vladimir Aptekarev, Director for Shipbuilding and Optimized Floating Power Units at Rosatom’s Atomenergomash, the concept of the OPEB project is based exclusively on the supply of electric power, in contrast to the Akademik Lomonosov FNPP, which performs the function of “cogeneration”, that is, it simultaneously supplies both electric and thermal energy.",
            "According to him, the OPEB will have increased capacity due to the use of a new type of reactor, which has been named RITM-200M. Such a power unit with an extended fuel cycle duration of up to 10 years, is capable of generating more than 100 MW of electrical energy. It is also possible to use cogeneration at the power unit – when thermal and electrical generation are simultaneously produced.",
            "According to Rosatom, currently the company is 7-8 years ahead of some major foreign rivals in some areas, while further successful implementation of the programme will allow the company to increase this gap and will contribute to increased exports of Russian nuclear products.",
            "Ukraine and Russia’s nuclear business",
            "Ukraine and related sanctions regimes have seen Russian nuclear exports avoid any serious problems in the short term. In 2022, the growth of Russian nuclear exports amounted to more than 20%, which means that the country remains one of the world leaders in the global nuclear energy market.",
            "Still, despite this, Rosatom currently faces serious risks of losing some important contracts in key international markets and an on-going threat of potential sanctions. That may even take place this year, as pressure grows among the international community to tighten the sanctions regime further.",
            "Nonetheless, one of the recipes of success for Rosatom in the international arena in the past has been related to its status as a ‘universal» nuclear company’, which constructs power units, trains personnel, supplies fuel and provides other services. More importantly, the company traditionally builds nuclear power plants under a system of preferential state-backed loans provided by the Russian government. This facility allows its major foreign customers to build their nuclear power facilities in debt on preferential conditions for them.",
            "As a result, Rosatom has achieved significant success across the majority of its activity areas. For example, Russia’s current share of the global uranium enrichment market is about 30%, which makes it the leader in this segment. In the European Union, utilities that generate electricity for 100 million people rely on the supply of Russian nuclear fuel, according to the Royal United Defense Research Institute (RUSI).",
            "Looking ahead though, the 24 February, 2022 invasion changed the landscape for Rosatom which does face significant problems in some of its major markets. As a state-owned corporation, Rosatom is wholly controlled by the Russian government, which is prompting many countries to reduce cooperation with it or even abandon projects. The situation continues to deteriorate too.",
            "In particular, immediately after the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine countries including Germany and Sweden abandoned plans for the further purchase Russian nuclear fuel. They also said that they would not place new orders in Russia.",
            "Moreover, countries including Bulgaria, Slovakia, Finland, and the Czech Republic have begun to take similar steps, despite the fact that they have 18 nuclear power plants on their territories built using the Soviet pressurized water reactor (VVER) technology.",
            "Earlier, the Finnish design company Fennovoima terminated a contract with Rosatom for the construction of the Hanhikivi-1 nuclear power plant. While Finland currently continues to buy nuclear fuel from Russia, it has declared its intention to switch to VVER fuel supplies from Westinghouse Electric.",
            "In the meantime, the Czech Republic and Bulgaria have already reduced the volume of fuel supplies for nuclear power plants from the Russian Federation, while Slovakia – where another VVER-type power unit was recently commissioned at Mochovce with the participation of Rosatom – also has similar plans.",
            "Among the EU states, only Hungary still has plans to build two more nuclear units at the Paks nuclear power plant.",
            "The contract for the completion of the station, for which Moscow provided a US$10bn loan to Budapest, was signed back in 2014. However, it is not entirely clear whether this project will be implemented. At the end of April, it was reported that the Hungarian government is now searching for alternative contractors for the project.",
            "In recent years, Ukraine has also been trying to replace Russian fuel. It is expected that starting from next year all power units of Ukrainian nuclear power plants remaining under the control of Kyiv, will switch to Westinghouse products.",
            "However, despite moves to ramp up production of alternatives to Rosatom’s TVEL fuel the transition of European countries to alternative sources may be delayed for years (according to various estimates, from 7-10 years). The Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Finland have already signed agreements with Westinghouse for future nuclear fuel deliveries. Prague and Sofia report they will be able to switch to American supplies as early as 2024-2025, while Helsinki will follow in 2027-2030.",
            "At the same time, it is difficult to overcome dependence on Russian imports of enriched uranium and services for its conversion and enrichment. Rosatom provides about 20% of the enriched uranium for the United States. In 2022, the United States imported US$829.8m-worth of Russian uranium (about the same amount it purchased in 2021), and in January 2023 another US$70m. France, which also has its own enrichment facilities, imported uranium from Russia to the sum of US$377.5m, which is about 3.5 times more than in 2021. State subsidies, cheap electricity and lower environmental standards make the Russian nuclear products very attractive to foreign customers.",
            "Routes to replacing Russia",
            "Currently Russian nuclear sector in general and Rosatom in particular is not a subject of sectoral sanctions by the EU and the US. At the end of February, however, the UK imposed personal sanctions against Rosatom CEO Alexei Likhachev, other top managers of the state corporation, as well as several research institutes that are part of the structure of the state corporation. In April, the United States joined the targeted sanctions movement by the inclusion of Rusatom Overseas, which is responsible for promoting Rosatom projects abroad. The restrictions affected the Kovrov Mechanical Plant and Tochmash, which produce centrifuges for uranium enrichment.",
            "Following US sanctions, five G7 countries – the UK, Canada, the US, France and Japan – have agreed to withdraw from cooperation with Russia in the nuclear energy market as part of moves to weaken the country’s hold on the nuclear sector. Specific plans have not been announced yet, but it is expected that the alliance primarily plans to replace the supply of uranium fuel, as well as reduce the overall dependence of other countries on Russian technologies, equipment and materials.",
            "The prospects for Rosatom in the East and South look better than in the West. In addition to exporting fuel and fuel components, Rosatom continues to build nuclear reactors in China, India, Turkey, Bangladesh and Egypt (these countries have not announced their own sanctions against Russia, but they try not to violate the restrictions imposed by other states). The state corporation also plans to expand its presence on the African continent.",
            "In the case of Africa, currently the company continues to build El Dabaa, the first nuclear power plant on the African continent with generation III+ reactors. “This nuclear power plant will provide 30 TWh per year to Egypt and will prevent the emission of 15 million tons of carbon annually – a huge contribution to the country’s green energy future,” said as Kirill Komarov, Director of the Department of International Business of Rosatom.",
            "China and other non-Western countries are also unlikely to fully replace Russia with the Western market for in terms of contracts and their volumes. Most analysts, also believe that Western countries are currently not ready to eliminate all nuclear products from Russia.",
            "In the event of interruptions in Russian nuclear exports to Western markets, there may be a shortage of cobalt-60 or cesium-137 in both the EU and the US, for example. These isotopes are used for radiation therapy, the sterilisation of medical equipment and foodstuffs, and industrial seam welding.",
            "Problems with the supply of actinium-225 and tungsten-188 may also pose a threat to radionuclide therapy for cancer patients. The cessation of Russian exports of californium-252 will delay the launch of a nuclear power plant in France, since californium is used in reactors as the initiator of a chain reaction. Even the United States depends on the supply of 44 isotopes from Russia. In particular, technetium-99 is produced from Russian molybdenum-99, which is used annually in millions of medical imaging procedures in the United States. Russia is currently the only supplier of barium-132, which is used in oil and gas processing. Moreover, Russia supplies iridium-192, which is used to check for leaks in pipelines.",
            "Ultimately though, despite the importance of the nuclear sector, Rosatom’s external projects do not bring Russia nearly as much profit as the oil and gas industry. In 2021, Rosatom transferred RUB250 billion (US$2,67 billion) in taxes to the state budget, while revenues from gas and oil at the same time amounted to RUB9 trillion (US$90 billion).",
            "Despite the complex geopolitics and the growing pressure on the Russian economy, Rosatom hopes that implementation of the majority of its key projects will continue and it will retain its status as one of the world’s leading corporations in the field of nuclear power."

            "Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom and US Westinghouse Electric Company have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to co-operate on the development and deployment in Ukraine of the Westinghouse AP300 small modular reactor (SMR). The agreement, signed by Energoatom President Petro Kotin and Westinghouse CEO Patrick Fragman, establishes a joint working group to collaborate on contracting, licensing and the local supply chain. Ukrainian Energy Minister Herman Galushchenko, who attended the signing ceremony, said SMR technology is very promising for Ukraine, especially in terms implementing its Energy Strategy of until 2050.",
            "\"Ukraine has every prospect of becoming one of the clean energy leaders and increasing nuclear generation capacity both through the construction of new high-capacity power units and through the installation of small modular reactors, the first of which may appear within the next 10 years\", he noted, adding that an important component of the agreements is manufacturing localisation.",
            "Westinghouse submitted its pre-application Regulatory Engagement Plan with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) the AP300 in May. Westinghouse claims it is the only SMR “truly based on an Nth-of-a-kind operating plant” and describes it as a “game-changer”. The 300 MWe single-loop pressurised water reactor is a scaled-down version of its AP1000.",
            "Kotin said Energoatom is continuing to work on new projects of advanced nuclear technologies. “The company is doing its utmost to ensure that our state continues to move towards a carbon-free, clean future, an integral component of which is nuclear energy,\" he noted.",
            "\"From nuclear fuel to plant services to electricity generation, Westinghouse is honoured to be a trusted partner for Ukraine today and for decades to come\", said Westinghouse CEO Fragman. Another agreement signed by the parties provides for the deepening of cooperation between Energoatom and Westinghouse in the construction of the first of nine planned AP1000 units. In particular, it is planned to supply the major reactor components to the Khmelnitsky NPP.",
            "In January, Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers approved development of project documentation for the construction of two AP1000 reactors at Khmelnitsky. Galushchenko said at the time that the target date to complete construction and start-up of units was 2030-2032, depending on the impact of the ongoing military hostilities. The estimated cost of each unit at about $5bn. He said work could start on a technical and economic feasibility study.",

            "In recent months, nuclear power development in Asia has become the focus of growing attention. Globally, the number of nuclear reactors is increasing in Asia, while it is decreasing in Western Europe and North America. As the WNA notes: “Asia is the main region in the world where electricity generating capacity and specifically nuclear power are growing significantly. In Asia there are about 140 operable nuclear power reactors, about 30-35 under construction and firm plans to build an additional 40-50. Many more are proposed.”",
            "While this has been the trend for some time, it has accelerated in recent years, partly because of growing concerns about energy in general, following stringent Western sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas supplies. These considerations have, in some cases, even reversed the negative impact of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi disaster in Japan, which saw a number of countries such as South Korea and Taiwan embark on nuclear-phase out policies.",
            "Another factor is the increasing number of small modular reactor (SMR) designs being offered to the market, encouraged by both private investment and government grants and awards. SMRs are being promoted as suitable for smaller countries that had hitherto ruled out standard NPPs as inappropriate or unaffordable.",
            "Asian countries with established nuclear power programmes or NPPs under construction include China, India, Pakistan, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Bangladesh. Many others are now considering or reconsidering developing nuclear power, enticed by the promise of SMRs.",
            "In terms of operable nuclear power units, China leads Asia with 55~ ranking third worldwide. Next comes Japan with 33, but only 10 are currently operating. South Korea has 25, ranking fifth worldwide. India has 22, Pakistan six, Taiwan two and Bangladesh two under construction.",
            "China is largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western technology (from Canada, France and the US), which it is now exporting. Its 55 nuclear units at eight sites have a total capacity of 53,286 MWe. A further 23 units under construction at eight sites will add 24,296 MWe. In addition, some 45 units are planned totalling 50,110 MWe, with around 80 more firmly proposed.",
            "Three large state companies (and their subsidiaries) are responsible for NPP construction – China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) and State Energy Investment Corporation (SPIC). The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are pressurised water reactors (PWRs), including the oldest unit, Qinshan 1, a 300 MWe Chinese-designed PWR, which started operating in 1991. Other technologies include pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs), high temperature gas cooled reactors (HTGRs) and fast neutron reactors (FNRs).",
            "Imported technologies include two Canadian Candu-6 PHWRs at Qinshan Phase III (Zhejiang province); French PWR M310 units at Daya Bay and Ling Ao and EPRs at Taishan (Guangdong province); Russian VVER-1000 and VVER-1200 PWRs at Tianwan (Jiangsu province) and Xudabao (Liaoning province); and US AP-1000 PWRs at Haiyang (Shandong province) and Sanmen (Zhejiang province).",
            "Indigenous development was based mainly on French M31 technology with CNNC and CGN producing slightly different versions: CNP1000, CNP600, CNP300, ACP300, ACP600, ACP1000 for CNNC; and CPR1000, M310+, ACPR1000 for CGN. The 1,000 MWe versions have now been integrated as the Hualong One (HPR1000). Three Hualong one units are already in operation in China with nine more under construction and others planned. China also adapted the US (Westinghouse) AP1000 under a technology transfer deal as the CAP1000 and CAP1400. Four CAP1000s are now under construction at sites originally planned for AP1000s.",
            "The Hualong One is China’s main export model. As yet, China has only exported NPPs to Pakistan, but the country also expects to finalise an agreement with Argentina. The UK cancelled plans for construction of a Hualong One at its Bradwell-on-Sea site largely for political reasons and China was also excluded from NPP tenders in the Czech Republic and Poland.",
            "China is also pushing ahead with SMRs and advanced reactors. CNNC’s SMR demonstration project at the Changjiang NPP (Hainan province) features the multi- purpose125 MWe ACP-100 (Linglong One) developed from the larger ACP1000 PWR. It is designed for electricity generation, urban heating and cooling, industrial steam production, or seawater desalination. Construction of the main internal structure for the reactor building has been completed. It was the first SMR project to pass an independent safety assessment by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts in 2016. In 2017, a joint venture was set up by China National Nuclear Power Co (part of CNNC) and four other domestic companies to develop and produce small, floating NPPs. Its remit was R&D, construction, operation & management and sales including possible exports.",
            "China is also building two demonstration pool-type sodium-cooled CFR-600 fast reactors in Xiapu county, Fujian province, as part of its plans to establish a closed nuclear fuel cycle. Construction of the first CFR-600 began in 2017 based on the China Experimental Fast Reactor (CEFR) at the China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE) in Beijing. The CEFR was built with the assistance of Russia, which is supplying fuel for both the CEFR and CFR-600.",
            "Before the 2011 Fukushima disaster, Japan’s 54 reactors at 17 NPPs generated 30% of its power with plans to increase the share to 40%. All 54 were closed after the accident and new stringent safety standards were introduced by the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) in 2013. A total of 21 reactors were closed permanently, leaving 33 operable units totalling 31,679 MWe at 13 NPPs. As yet only 10 units (9,486 MWe) are in operation at six NPPs. Others are in the process of being reactivated or undergoing modifications to meet the new regulations with 16 awaiting regulatory approval to restart. Work stopped on two reactors that were under construction in 2011 (Shimane 3 and Ohma 1) and they are still facing delays. Japan’s NPPs all operate light water reactors (LWRs), the first of which were bought from US vendors such as General Electric and Westinghouse. Japanese companies were subcontracted to take part in construction and these were later licensed to build similar plants. Companies such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry (MHI) developed the capacity to design and construct LWRs and by the late 1970s, Japan had established a domestic nuclear power industry. Currently it exports equipment worldwide and is also developing new reactor designs. MHI is designing an advanced 1200 MWe LWR (SRZ-1200) in cooperation with four EPCs (Kansai, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and Shikoku.)",
            "Reactor restarts have been slower than expected. In 2022, nuclear only accounted for around 8% of electricity supply. The government’s Green Transformation (GX) strategic plan assumes that nuclear will account for 20–22% by 2030. Japan’s reactors include both PWRs, boiling water reactors (BWRs) and advanced BWRs (ABWRs). To date only PWRs have been restarted as BWRs require a filtered containment venting system, complicating the upgrades needed to meet the new regulations. Parliament recently endorsed Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s policy to allow reactor operation beyond the 60-year limit set after Fukushima and to replace ageing facilities with next-generation advanced reactors.",
            "Japan had planned to use FNRs as part of a wider policy to expand the use of mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel, with up to 18 reactors designated to use MOX. After Fukushima this was reduced to 12, only four of which are approved for operation, with three still awaiting approval to restart. Moreover, operation of the Monju FNR and Japan Atomic Energy Agency’s (JAEA’s) Joyo experimental FNR was impeded by a series of technical and political problems. This ultimately led to Monju’s closure but in May 2023, NRA said Joyo had met regulatory standards, and could restart.",
            "Japan is working closely with the USA on FNR development. JAEA, MHI, and Mitsubishi FBR Systems (MFBR) recently signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US-based Terrapower to develop sodium-cooled fast reactor technology. This is supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Reactor Design Demonstration Program (ARDP). MHI said Japan will accelerate innovations in various nuclear technologies through international collaboration on next-generation innovative reactors. Terrapower’s Natrium reactor is also being developed jointly with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy.",
            "In 2021, JAEA also resumed operation of its 30 MW experimental High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR), closed for more than 10 years, after the HTGR was upgraded to meet the new regulatory requirements. JAEA is also co-operating with Poland’s National Centre for Nuclear Research to design a HTGR.",
            "Like China, South Korea is now largely self-sufficient in reactor design and construction based on adaptations of Western (mainly US) technology, which it is now exporting. Its 25 nuclear units at four sites have a total capacity of 24,489 MWe and account for around 27% of its electricity needs. Three more units under construction at two sites will add 4,020 MWe, with two units planned totalling 2,800 MWe.",
            "Most of South Korea’s nuclear units are LWRs apart from four Candu-6 PHWRs at its Wolsong NPP. South Korea’s first nuclear unit, Kori 1 (now closed), a Westinghouse unit built on a turnkey basis, began operation in 1978. Seven more were built in the 1980s based Westinghouse and Framatome technology including two involving Combustion Engineering (CE), which became part of Westinghouse. Korea’s ambitions to develop its own nuclear technology for export led to new reactor designs being developed. In 2005 the OPR- 1000 (Optimised Power Reactor) was launched with an eye to Asian markets. South Korea now has 10 operating OPR-1000 units and has since developed the Generation III APR-1400, three of which are in operation.",
            "Korea has an extensive nuclear R&D base and manufacturing capacity including state-owned Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Electric Power Co (Kepco) and subsidiary Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) as well as heavy engineering companies such as Samsung, Daewoo, Hyundai, and Doosan. These dominate the domestic market and are increasingly active globally.",
            "Projects include a variety of advanced reactors and SMRs, including the 330MWt System-Integrated Modular Advanced Reactor (SMART) reactor, which began development in 1997. In 2015 the SMART Power Company Ltd was launched supported by six supply chain companies to promote exports particularly to the Middle East and a co-operation agreement was signed with Saudi Arabia. Korea is also working on a sodium-cooled FNR in close co-operation with the US, and a HTGR for hydrogen generation.",
            "Korea is driven by considerations of energy security and the need to minimise dependence on imported fuels and technology. Kepco markets the OPR1000 and APR1400 globally. In 2009 the APR1400 was selected by the UAE for its four-unit Barakah NPP, now almost complete with three units already in operation ahead of schedule and within budget. Korea also won a contract in 2009 to supply a research reactor to Jordan, which was commissioned in 2016. In 2010 Korea announced plans to export 80 reactors by 2030, targeting 20% of the global market. It aimed to be 100% self-sufficient in nuclear technology by 2012, with no residual intellectual property constraints. US design certification for the APR1400 was finally approved in 2019 and in 2023 a new APR1000 design, specifically developed for the European market, was certified by the European Utility Requirements organisation. The success of the UAE project sparked interest worldwide and preliminary agreements were signed with several countries.",
            "Despite Fukushima, Korea announced plans in 2012 to increase nuclear’s share to 60% by 2035. However, in the face of growing public opposition, the government in 2013 drafted a reduced plan for a 29% nuclear share by 2035 and in 2017, the new government of President Moon Jae-in adopted a phase out plan. By the time this policy was reversed in 2023 by President Yoon Suk-yeol, the nuclear industry had lost a lot of ground. The new target was a 34.6% nuclear share by 2036, the export of 10 NPPs by 2030 and development of a Korean SMR design for export.",
            "Korea’s ties to the US have also complicated its nuclear development. The 1974 Korea-US Atomic Energy Agreement that limited raw material supply and banned uranium enrichment and fuel reprocessing in Korea was extended for 20 years in 2015. Faced with pressure from Korea, the renewed agreement was framed more as a partnership, but it still contained restrictions. In May 2022 Korea joined the US-led Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme during a visit from US President Joe Biden’s visit to Korea to collaborate in promoting the global deployment of SMRs.",
            "However, Westinghouse filed a lawsuit against KHNP after it signed an agreement with Polish private company ZE PAK to build an APR1400 at a former coal plant. This came after a tender to supply reactors for Poland’s nuclear power programme was awarded to Westinghouse. This also undermined Korea’s plans for possible exports to the Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia. The lawsuit alleged intellectual property infringement by KHNP insisting on US government consent for export of the APR1400 claiming that it uses Westinghouse technology.",
            "India’s largely indigenous nuclear power programme is self- sufficient in reactor design and construction. Its 22 operable reactors at seven sites have a total capacity of 6,795 MWe, although three are currently suspended for repair leaving 19 operating units with a total capacity of 6,290 MWe. Eight more units under construction at four sites will add 6,028 MWe, with 12 further units planned. Nuclear currently accounts for around 1.5% of India’s installed power capacity. In April 2023 the government announced plans to increase nuclear capacity to 22,480 MWe by 2031, with nuclear accounting for nearly 9% of India’s electricity by 2047.",
            "The reactor fleet comprises a range of different technologies, both imported and indigenous. Most are Indian designed PHWRs. Other technologies include India’s first power reactor, a Canadian supplied Candu at Rajasthan NPP, which started up in 1973 and closed in 2004; two BWRs built by GE on a turnkey contract at Tarapur NPP (currently suspended); and two VVERs (PWRs) at Kudankulam supplied by Russia. India is also building a 500 MWe FNR at Kalpakkam. The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) is responsible for construction and operation of India’s NPPs and Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam Limited (Bhavini) is responsible for FNR development.",
            "Engineering companies, such as state-owned Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL), are key players in nuclear construction. The 1962 Atomic Energy Act prohibited private control of nuclear power generation. Amendments in 2016 only allow public sector joint ventures and direct foreign investment only in the supply chain and not in construction.",
            "India has a large and sophisticated nuclear R&D and manufacturing base, having launched its first research reactor, supplied by the UK, in 1957. Initially nuclear development was supported mainly by the UK, Canada, the US and France. However, after India’s nuclear bomb test in 1974, all support was withdrawn. The newly established Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), from which India was excluded, prevented India from importing any nuclear technology or fuel, setting it on a path of independent nuclear development.",
            "With limited uranium resources, India embarked on a three-stage programme aimed at using its abundant thorium resources based on an advanced heavy-water thorium cycle. Stage 1 would use PHWRs and LWRs. Plutonium from these would fuel the fast reactors planned for Stage 2. Advanced Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs) in Stage 3 would burn thorium-plutonium fuels in a self- sustaining fuel cycle. An alternative end stage could be molten salt breeder reactors (MSBRs).",
            "India immediately embarked on construction of small PHWRs and by 2008, 12 200-220 MWe units were in operation at five sites, as well as two 540 MWe units at Tarapur NPP.",
            "In 2002 the regulatory authority approved construction of a 500 MWe prototype fast breeder reactor (PFBR) at Kalpakkam, which is now nearing completion, while research is underway on molten salt reactors (MSRs).",
            "Only Russia continued cooperation based on a 1988 agreement that pre-dated the NSG, and in 2002 began construction of two VVER-1000 units at the Kudankulam NPP. Then, in 2005, India signed a civil nuclear agreement with the US, leading in 2008 to an NSG waiver for India, despite its not signing the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). This enabled nuclear trade to resume but negotiations to include India as a full NSG member have so far stalled on Chinese opposition. Nevertheless, the waiver enabled India to sign nuclear cooperation agreements with numerous countries and to start discussions with the US, France, Japan and South Korea on possible construction.",
            "However, India’s nuclear liability regime impeded progress. Following the 1984 Bhopal disaster India passed a law, making equipment suppliers responsible for any future accident. Amendments in 2010 made plant operators primarily liable but still allowed possible recourse to suppliers. A compromise was reached with Russia, which continued construction at Kudankulam, where two units are now operating with two more under construction and others planned. Other suppliers remained hesitant. While projects were agreed with France for six EPRs at Jaitapur and with the US for six AP1000s at Kovvada, they have not been finalised. India, meanwhile, embarked on a programme to build larger 700 MWe PHWRs, the first of which began operating at the Kakrapar NPP (unit 3) in 2021, with plans for 10 more.",
            "Pakistan has six operable reactors at two sites supplied on a turnkey basis by China, with a total capacity of 3,262 MWe. Four CNP-300 reactors (300-315 MWe) at the Chasma NPP site began operation between 2011 and 2017. In June 2023, Pakistan and China signed an agreement for construction of a 1,100 MWe Hualong One (HPR1000) reactor for Chasma 5. Unit 1 at the Karachi NPP site, a 137 MWe Candu supplied by Canada that began operation in 1971 and closed in 2021 was the first nuclear power unit in Asia. The site also hosts two Chinese supplied 1,017 MWe Hualong One units that began operation in 2021 and 2022. Over the coming decade Pakistan plans to expand its nuclear power generating capacity to 8,800 MWe.",

The Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science & Technology (Pinstech) at Rawalpindi with a US-supplied research reactor focuses on civil research and is under IAEA safeguards. Other facilities in Rawalpindi and Khushab continue to support weapons development.",
            "Like India, Pakistan is excluded from the NSG. However, all its power units are under IAEA safeguards and IAEA oversight and support is ongoing. In 2018 four IAEA national technical cooperation projects were amalgamated into a single project, PAK2007, “Strengthening and Enhancing Capabilities of Pakistan’s National Institutions to Support a Safe, Reliable & Sustainable Nuclear Power Programme”. This aims to streamline workflows, reduce delays and costs, enhance cooperation and harmonise safety and waste management approaches.",
            "Two of Taiwan’s three US-supplied two-unit NPPs (Chinshan, Kuosheng and Maanshan) have now been closed in line with a nuclear phase-out law adopted in 2016. A fourth NPP under construction, Lungmen, was cancelled. Taiwan’s six operable power reactors are to be decommissioned as their 40-year operating licences expire. Chinshan 1, Taiwan’s oldest plant, closed in 2018, followed by Chinshan 2 in 2019. These 600 MWe General Electric (GE) Mark I BWRs began operation in 1978 and 1979. Kuosheng 1&2, 985 MWe GE Mark III BWRs, which began operation in 1981 and 1983, were closed in 2021 and 2023. Construction of Lungmen 1&2 (both GE 1350 MWe ABWR units) began in 1999. Lungmen 1 was completed but mothballed in 2015, and construction of Lungmen 2 was suspended in 2014.",
            "Taiwan now has two operable nuclear units at the Maanshan plant, both Westinghouse 936 MWe PWRs, whose operating licences expire in 2024 and 2025. Owner-operator Taipower also operates coal power plants, which are to be replaced by natural gas turbines. Taiwan’s first deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are expected in 2023. While there is strong anti-nuclear sentiment in Taiwan, the opposition Kuomintang Party, which is expected to win the forthcoming elections, opposed the nuclear phase out.",
            "While early nuclear development in Asia was largely influenced by regional rivalries, today it is the focus of a global power struggle between China and the US. India has so far largely avoided involvement in this geopolitical game. Pakistan’s close ties with China are evident, as are South Korea’s and Japan’s ties with the US. China would clearly like to increase exports of its Hualong One and also SMRs, including floating NPPs, and is increasingly becoming a competitive vendor. There are numerous other runners and riders looking to embrace nuclear power, especially with the emergence of smaller modular reactors that are more appropriate in places where a full-sized NPP might be more challenging to justify. Longer term, it seems likely that Asia will continue to expand both its nuclear capacity and capabilities.",

The goal is to help smaller companies reduce dependence on government projects, therefore securing global market competitiveness amid rising demand for nuclear facilities worldwide.",
            "According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy (MOTIE), Korea’s nuclear companies have signed 143 export deals totalling $530m over the past five years. In most of the deals, the private companies participated as subcontractors for overseas projects won by state-run companies. Export deals signed directly by small- and mid-sized companies accounted for only 9% of the total.",

It was not clear which of the units – 1 or 2 – received the fuel, which reportedly will initially be mixed with the existing fuel supplied by Russia’s TVEL. Ukraine’s target, however, is to end the use of Russian-supplied fuel as soon as possible.",

            "Energy Minister Galushchenko noted that the contract for the supply of VVER-440 fuel assemblies had been concluded in September 2020. “And that we managed to do this so quickly is a great success and a significant basis for our further collaboration with Westinghouse, which is only expanding,” he said. Energoatom President Petro Kotin said Ukraine had asked Westinghouse to accelerate its development of VVER-440 fuel at the start of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine. “With our engineering support, they made it in a year and a half and brought it here to the Rivne NPP.”",
            "The President & CEO of Westinghouse Electric Company Patrick Fragman noted that specialists from Energoatom and Westinghouse had achieved in a year and a half, a task that would normally take 6-7 years. “We have done this together, and not only for Ukraine, but also for most European countries, where nuclear reactors can now be completely independent of the supply of fuel from Russia,” he commented.",
            "Rivne 1&2, commissioned in 1980 and 1981, are the only VVER-440 units in Ukraine. Ukraine also operates 13 VVER-1000 units, including Rivne 3&4 and Westinghouse has been supplying VVER-1000 fuel to Ukraine since 2005, when the first lead test assemblies were delivered to unit 3 the South Ukraine NPP.",
            "Over the past several years there has been growing pressure from the European Union (EU) for member states to diversify away from the use of Russian-supplied fuel. Westinghouse Electric Sweden, is leading the Accelerated Programme for Implementation of Secure VVER Fuel Supply (APIS), which was launched in January. There are currently over 30 reactors of VVER-440 and VVER-1000 design operating in the EU and in Ukraine.",
            "In July the EU selected a consortium led by Westinghouse to develop and deliver a secure, fully European nuclear fuel supply for Russian-designed VVERs. The three-year APIS project is co-funded by the EU, using €10m ($10.9m) from the Euratom Work Programme 2023-2025. APIS, part of the EU's Horizon Europe programme for research & innovation, involves 12 partners from eight countries.",
            "These include five NPP operators – CEZ (Czech Republic), Ukraine’s Energoatom; Fortum (Finland), Paks NPP (Hungary), and Slovenske Elektrarne (Slovakia); two fuel manufacturers – Westinghouse Sweden and Enusa (Spain); and five fuel engineering & research organisations – Joint Research Centre-European Commission (Belgium), State Scientific & Technical Centre for Nuclear & Radiation Safety (Ukraine), ÚJV Rež (Czech Republic), Uppsala University (Sweden) and VUJE (Slovakia).",

It has already has supplied VVER fuel to Ukraine for more than a decade, although the switch from Russian TVEL fuel had its problems. Energoatom launched a project for the qualification of Westinghouse fuel in 2000, and in 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden signed a contract to ship fuel to three or six Ukrainian reactors between 2011 and 2015. However, during trial use at South Ukraine in 2012, some fuel became deformed causing significant damage to the reactor and Ukraine later suspended its use pending a redesign.",
            "Following Ukraine's change of government in 2014, the contract was revived and extended. After problems developed with the fuel, it was structurally modified and modernised. Westinghouse experienced similar problems with its initial supplies of VVER-1000 fuel to Temelin NPP in the Czech Republic. In 2009 Temelin cut short its contract with Westinghouse and reverted to TVEL fuel, until 2019 when redesigned Westinghouse assemblies were again tried.",
            "Meanwhile the race was on to develop an alternative to TVEL’s VVER-440 fuel. Finland had sourced fuel from Westinghouse (then part of BNFL) for its two VVER-440 units at Loviisa from 2001 to 2007, but decided to switch to TVEL. Westinghouse then shut down its manufacture of VVER-440 fuel and has rushed to redesign it in collaboration with Spain’s Enusa.

            "With the start of commercial operations anticipated any day now, Vogtle Unit 3 and its sister Unit 4 are the first new nuclear units to be built in the US in over 30 years.",
            "As they close in on electrical generation, for the nuclear industry, the completion of Unit 3 of the Vogtle power plant marks a hugely important infrastructure investment project and for many signals a new era of US nuclear development.",
            "Located near Waynesboro in Burke County, east Georgia near the border with South Carolina, Vogtle 3 & 4 are the only two new nuclear units currently under construction in the United States. Each features an 1,117 MW AP1000 pressurised water reactor (PWR) from Westinghouse and, again, this is the first plant in the US to see these AP units deployed, although four AP1000 reactors – Sanmen 1 and 2 and Haiyang 1 and 2 – were commissioned in 2018 in China.",
            "As a GEN III+ reactor, the AP (Advanced Passive) design is the first such reactor to receive design certification from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As the names suggests, this design features passive safety systems that allow the nuclear core to be cooled even in the absence of operator interventions or mechanical assistance, for example. The AP1000 plant’s passive safety systems use only natural forces such as gravity, natural circulation and compressed gas to achieve their critical safety functions and no pumps, fans, diesel engines, chillers or other active machinery are necessary to maintain safety, with the exception of the valves that automatically actuate the passive safety systems.",
            "Each of the four units features a natural circulation cooling tower for the main steam condenser and a pair of secondary, smaller, mechanical draft coolers that provide service water and cooling for reactor decay heat if necessary. Each of the main cooling towers stands at around 170 metres tall.",
            "Units 1&2, which are 1,215 MWe reactors, were also supplied by Westinghouse. They were completed in 1987 and 1989, respectively. In 2009, the US Nuclear Regulatory Authority renewed their licences for an additional 20 years. Unit 1 is now scheduled to run until January 2047 while Unit 2 is currently licenced through to September 2049. The two new units are expected to have an operational lifespan of between 60 and 80 years, suggesting they will potentially still be operating through to the next century.",
            "At around the same time as the licence renewal, in early 2009, Georgia Public Service Commission approved the Vogtle expansion reactors and construction activities began the same year. Initially, the units were expected to enter service in 2016 and 2017, but suffered a series of delays, including as a result of Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017, that saw the projects fall several years behind schedule. Nonetheless, in 2017 Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, contracted global engineering, construction and project management firm Bechtel to manage construction efforts of the new reactors. Bechtel operations come under the direction of Southern Nuclear, another Southern Company subsidiary, which already operates the two existing units at the Vogtle plant and will assume operational control of the two new units once they are fully commissioned.",
            "The Vogtle Electric Generating Plant is jointly owned by Georgia Power with a 45.7% holding, Oglethorpe Power Corporation holds 30%, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) has a 22.7% stake and Dalton Utilities has 1.6% equity.",
            "The new units are billed as an essential part of Georgia Power’s commitment to deliver ‘safe, clean, reliable and affordable energy’ for its customers. The units will also play a significant role in supporting Southern Company’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.",

            "The various modules used for Vogtle units 3 & 4 were manufactured in advance of arriving in Waynesboro ready to be assembled into larger components. Major modules have been arriving at the site by rail and truck since 2011. These modules have included a range of plant components such as floor and wall sections and supporting structures that surround the containment buildings and reactor vessels. The last of the 1,485 major modules required to complete construction had been manufactured and delivered to the construction site in late 2019.",
            "Subsequently, in April 2021, all modules for both Vogtle expansion units were put in place when a large water tank, known as CB20, was lifted into its position at the top of Unit 4’s containment vessel and shield building roof. The placement also represented the last major crane lift at the project site.",
            "This module, the Passive Containment Cooling Water Storage Tank, is a major part of the AP1000 reactor’s passive safety system. It stands some 11 metres (35 feet) tall and weighs more than 32 tonnes (720,000 lbs). The tank, which can be filled from water stored elsewhere on site, will hold some 2.8 million litres (750,000 US gals). This water tcan be used cool the reactor in the event of a cooling system failure and can also be directed into the used fuel pool if necessary.",
            "At the peak of construction, the Vogtle 3 & 4 workforce included 1,500 Bechtel staff and nearly 7,500 members of North America’s Building Trades Unions (NABTU). With more than 7,000 workers at the Vogtle site, the project was the largest construction project in the state of Georgia, as well as a major US infrastructure development. Once the construction phase is bought to a conclusion some 800 permanent jobs will be created as the units begin commercial operations.",
            "That day is close, Unit 3 completed Hot Functional Testing in April 2021, when the plant systems achieved normal operating pressure and temperature, although without any nuclear fuel. The first nuclear fuel assemblies for Unit 3 arrived at the site in December 2021and last October fuel was loaded into Unit 3. During fuel loading, the 157 fuel assemblies were transferred from the Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the reactor core. In March this year, operators first initiated nuclear reactions and in April,",
            "Unit 3 first generated electricity and synchronized and connected to the electric grid. According to Georgia Power this was followed by testing through the full range of plant operations, including safely running at various power levels and operating through real-life conditions, including the operation of the reactor, plant control systems and support systems, and integrated plant operations.",
            "After Unit 3 reached 100% power on 29 May, Georgia Power had projected a Unit 3 in-service date for the following month. However, the projects have experienced several delays as testing identified problems. Indeed, when Georgia Power received unanimous approval in December 2017 from the Georgia Public Service Commission to complete Vogtle units 3 and 4, the projected commissioning dates had been reported as expected in November 2021 for Unit 3 and November 2022 for Unit 4. Those dates have now been pushed back several times. Most recently, the in-service dates have been revised to the third quarter of this year for Unit 3 and possibly as late as the first quarter of next year for Unit 4.",
            "Among the issues identified, in January this year, Georgia Power notified the US Securities & Exchange Commission that vibrations were detected in the plant’s cooling system. It was found during start-up and pre-operational testing that construction workers had failed to install some of the supports which had been detailed in the blueprints. While those supports have now been installed several other issues were also detected during commissioning and testing.",
            "According to reported comments from Southern Chairman and CEO, Tom Fanning, these issues have included a dripping valve, since repaired, as well as a problem involving the flow through the reactor coolant pumps. According to Fanning, this could be a physical issue or one related to the calibration of flow measurements.",
            "Commercial operation of unit 3 was also delayed for a month after Georgia Power noted a problem in the hydrogen system used to cool its main generator. The company said the problem was a degraded seal and the reactor was shut down while repairs are made. Georgia Power now estimates the reactor will begin commercial operations as NEI goes to press. Unit 3’s schedule ultimately also depends on potential impacts arising from unit 4 testing activities that overlap with unit 3 start-up and commissioning. The schedule also hinges on maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work, and maintaining appropriate levels of craft labourers. “Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases,” the utility company said.",
            "Meanwhile, in Unit 4 the placement of the 11 metre (35 foot) tall, 306-ton reactor pressure vessel inside Unit 4 had been completed in April 2018 while the placement of the Unit 4 containment vessel top head was completed in March 2020. More recently, in May this year, Unit 4 completed its hot functional testing programme. In a bid to avoid similar problems, lessons learned from the commissioning of Unit 3 are being applied to Unit 4. Fanning noted that there was a “marked improvement” in testing results for Unit 4 when compared with Unit 3. Kim Greene, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power explained: “The team at Unit 4 has been able to take lessons learned and best practices from Unit 3 and apply them. That has allowed us to safely complete hot functional testing on Unit 4 in a significantly shorter time frame than we did for Unit 3.” Nonetheless, a margin has been built into the schedule, given the experiences at Unit 3. According to Fanning, the company is “further risk-adjusting our Unit 4 schedule to reflect a range of projected in-service dates”.",
            "The site team is now focusing on completing the remaining work necessary to submit documentation to the NRC confirming that all inspection, tests and analyses have been performed. This is a requirement of Southern Nuclear’s Combined Operating License and must be verified before fuel can be loaded into the reactor.",
            "Fuel for the Unit 4 reactor also began arriving on site in May. As with Unit 3, the 157 fuel assemblies necessary for the start-up arrived at the plant by truck in shipping cannisters that are designed to transport non-irradiated uranium fuel. Once delivered, the assemblies were removed from the cannisters, lifted into the fuel handling area, and are now stored in a fuel vault prior to fuel load, which is projected to occur between July and October this year. Unit 4 is currently projected to enter service either in late fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024.",
            "Along with delays, the Vogtle expansion has also been hit with cost over runs. According to a Vogtle Construction Monitoring Report from 2017, certified construction and capital lending costs for the two new units had originally been estimated at US$14bn. Today that figure has more than doubled to over $30bn. Furthermore, Southern recently told shareholders that a three-month delay at Unit 3 would add $45m to construction costs for Georgia Power. However, Georgia Power wrote off $201m in additional costs on its latest financial statement, reflecting increased costs for the project. Georgia Power has also said it will now spend a projected $10.6bn on construction of the two units, not including some financing costs. This includes $407m in costs assumed from the three other owners, after all sued to force the company to honour a cost-sharing agreement. Georgia Power has settled its lawsuit with MEAG, but the suits with Oglethorpe and Dalton are still ongoing. The company has said it may have to pay those two co-owners another $345m in the dispute.",
            "Regulated utility Georgia Power serves some 2.7 million people and has requested capital costs from the rate-setting Georgia Public Service Commission $7.3 bn. Furthermore, parent company guarantees backed by Toshiba, which owns Westinghouse, were put in place to protect Georgia consumers at the beginning of construction phase. Toshiba fulfilled all remaining payments, a total of $3.68bn for the plant’s co-owners in December 2017, eliminating a major risk for continuing construction of the nation’s only new nuclear units.",
            "Even with the delays and associated cost increases though, after including federal production tax credits, interest savings from loan guarantees from the DOE and the fuel savings that nuclear energy brings over alternatives, the projected peak rate impact to Georgia Power retail customers is slightly less than 10%, well below original projections of around 12%.",
            "Upon completion of Units 3 and 4, Vogtle will become the largest nuclear power station in the US. Perhaps more significantly, the plant will be the delivering reliable zero-carbon power perhaps throughout this century and beyond. Vogtle is the first nuclear plant to be built in decades, it could be the first of many."

            "Slovak Nuclear & Decommissioning Company (JAVYS – Jadrová a Vyraďovacia Spoločnosť) and Électricité de France (EDF) signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) during the official visit of Slovak Economy Minister Peter Dovhun to Paris, strengthening nuclear co-operation between the Slovak Republic and France. The MOU relates in particular to projects aimed at the development of the construction of nuclear facilities and small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "JAVYS CEO Pavel Štuller noted that EDF is a leading supplier of innovative nuclear technology, including SMR technology. “The conclusion of the MOU does not create any exclusivity,” he noted. “Once the government of the Slovak Republic takes a decision on the location and type of a new nuclear source, we want to be a responsible manager of this process. Through the MOU, we expect a wider exchange of information in the field of new technologies in order to assess their suitability for inclusion in the Slovak energy network.”",
            "EDF First Vice President for new nuclear development Vakisasai Ramany welcomed “discussions on a programme for the construction of new nuclear facilities in the Slovak Republic, based on EPR1200 and Nuward SMR technologies”. He said EDF is committed to being a long-term partner of JAVYS and the Slovak Republic “for the development of an economically sound and efficient nuclear programme, drawing on its extensive experience, particularly from nuclear programmes in Europe”. He added that the agreement “is a key step in further consolidating EDF's objective of promoting access to a European nuclear fleet, based on European technologies and supporting a fully European supply chain, including Slovak industry”.",
            "Slovakia has five operating nuclear power reactors – units 1&2 at the Mochovce NPP and units 3&4 at the Bohunice units 3 and 4 – in commercial operation, generating half of its electricity. Mochovce 3 was connected to the grid in February and unit 4 is under construction. These are all Soviet designed VVER-440 reactors. A siting permit application has been submitted to the Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority for a new NPP near the Bohunice plant, by Jadrová Energetická Spoločnosť Slovenska – a joint venture between JAVYS and Czech utility ČEZ. SMRs are also being considered and in June memorandums of understanding were signed with US-based Westinghouse on the possible deployment of its AP1000 reactor and AP300 SMR.",
            "EDF’s EPR1200 is a derivative version of the EPR, the design of which takes into account feedback and experience gained from previous EPRs and EDF's operational fleet. Nuward is a 340 MWe SMR comprising two 170 MWe independent reactors housed in a single building."

            "The demand for LEU+ fuel (with 5-10% enrichment) is expected to grow as it offers increased power generation reducing the number of outages needed in NPPs for refuelling. Westinghouse says it is expanding operations at CFFF with advanced processes, upgraded equipment, and engineered safeguards for sustainable, efficient, and reliable fabrication of LEU+ nuclear fuel.",
            "“Westinghouse is committed to providing fuel products and engineering services required by our customers to achieve 24-month cycles through our High Energy Fuel Programme,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel President. “The programme is aligned with our customers’ needs for LEU+ fuel. Further, this vision will provide high-tech job opportunities and increase collaboration with our local technical colleges and universities in South Carolina.”",
            "Westinghouse is consulting stakeholders, including Federal and State regulators, local governments, and surrounding communities, to provide assurances about the continued safe operation of the CFFF, the protection of the public, and the environment.",
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a renewed operating licence for CFFF l in September 2022, authorising the facility to continue operations until 12 September 2062. The renewal followed completion of NRC’s safety and environmental reviews of the application. The final environmental impact statement, published in July 2022, catalogued “small” impacts on most resources, and “small to moderate” impacts on groundwater and waste generation during decommissioning.",

This followed an international tender for the supply of nuclear fuel and related services throughout the supply chain for the production of nuclear fuel. SE says the aim of the agreement is to diversify the supply of nuclear fuel for VVER 440 power plants in Slovakia.",
            "“Securing another nuclear fuel supplier for our power plants is an important step in strengthening Slovakia’s energy security. Nuclear power plants represent an important pillar in our country's energy mix, therefore I consider it to be crucial to secure nuclear fuel supply diversification for their stable operation,” said SE Director General Branislav Strýček.",
            "Slovakia operates five VVER-440 nuclear power units at two NPP sites – Mochovce 1,2&3 and Bohunice 3&4. A sixth unit, Mochovce 4, still under construction, is expected to be connected next year. Previously fuel for Slovakia’s NPPs was supplied by Russia’s TVEL, but in line with European policy Slovakia is seeking to diversify suppliers.",
            "According to SE, the first fuel supplies from Westinghouse are expected within approximately one year after approval for use of the fuel is received from the regulator. “The fuel supplied by Westinghouse Electric Sweden must first undergo the licensing process, to approve its use in Slovak power plant reactors, as part of which it must be demonstrated that its use will be safe,” SE noted.",
            "Slovakia’s diversification strategy is to have at least two alternative nuclear fuel suppliers and several potential suppliers of materials and services throughout the supply chain, SE said.",
            "“We are very pleased to contribute to Slovakia’s fuel diversification and to strengthen our long-standing partnership with Slovenské Elektrárne,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “We offer the only fully-Western alternative fuel for this type of reactor and remain committed to supporting Slovakia’s operating fleet, leveraging our Swedish fabrication footprint.\"",
            "Westinghouse had earlier developed fuel for VVER-1000 reactors, but the design for VVER-440 fuel is still under development. At the end of 2022, Spain’s Enusa Industrias Avanzadas and Westinghouse formalised a cooperation agreement regarding the manufacture of VVER-440 fuel. Enusa began to reinstall a production line for this product at its Juzbado factory with the aim of licensing it in 2023 to make possible fuel deliveries from the beginning of 2024.",
            "Through this agreement, Westinghouse and Enusa will manufacture the fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain, as supply contracts are signed.",
            "Westinghouse and Enusa have partnered since 1974 under a Pressurised-Water Reactor (PWR) fuel technology transfer agreement supporting plants in Spain, Belgium, and France among others. In 1999, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) bought Westinghouse’s commercial nuclear power businesses. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to Fortum’s Loviisa NPP in Finland, which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "These designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006 when Westinghouse was purchased by Toshiba. However, the Loviisa fuel contract was not renewed and Westinghouse withdrew from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and development of the VVER-440 design.",

        "text": [
            "The decommissioning of a mothballed NPP at Fort Greely in Alaska is expected to resume after the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) resolved a contract dispute that had delayed work for more than a year. The final phase of decommissioning and dismantling the SM-1A heat and power plant has been on hold since 2022 after a company competing for the contract filed protests over handling of the bid proposals.",
            "In August 2022, USACE awarded a $103m contract to South Carolina-based Westinghouse Government Services. However, officials for competing firm, Louisiana-based Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning (A3D) appealed against the decision to the federal General Accounting Office (GAO). USACE was directed by GAO to reopen discussions with the competing companies and to re-evaluate the bid proposals.",
            "“We ultimately made the decision to reverse the award, based on our re-evaluation of proposals,” said USACE project manager Brenda Barber. “So the award is going to Aptim-Amentum Alaska Decommissioning, and the Westinghouse Government Services contract has been terminated.” Barber said that when USACE allowed the competing companies to submit final proposals, A3D lowered its bid for the contract to $95.3m. “And it was deemed to be fair (and) reasonable, and resulted in an award to them,” she said.",
            "The SM-1A was a field prototype of a medium-sized nuclear reactor developed by the Army during the Cold War for use at remote military installations. It generated 20 MWt for steam heat and 1.8 MWe. All of the fuel in the reactor core has been removed along with highly activated control and absorber rods. All of the solid waste around the reactor was packaged up and shipped to waste-disposal facilities in other US states.",
            "Some of the plant’s primary system components, including the reactor and its pressure vessel and coolant pumps, were entombed inside the facility. They were either kept in place, or cut off and placed in the bottom of the tall vapour containment building before being grouted and concreted.",
            "SM-1A was built between 1958 and 1962, and operated from 1962 to 1972. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). 1A designates it as the first field plant of its type. It was designed to be used as an “in-service” test facility in an Arctic environment with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam for the utility systems at Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear-type electrical plant in a remote area where fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "The final shutdown in March 1972 was in accordance with the SM-1A Decommissioning Plan approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health & Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the highly enriched uranium dioxide nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapour container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected to minimise costs and personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was deferred until radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced. In 1995, Fort Greely was placed on the Base Realignment and Closure list (BRAC) under which certain areas were investigated and remediated. The base was then removed from the BRAC list and remained open to support critical Army missions.",
            "The decommissioning strategy developed in the 1970s recommended that the deactivated reactors should be placed into a safe storage mode to allow the shorter-lived radionuclides to decay. Delaying decommissioning was expected to reduce radioactive waste volumes and worker exposures. However, preliminary studies indicated that the levels of contamination present within the reactors would not be reduced by decay sufficiently to allow for release of the facilities without significant decontamination. Additionally, concern regarding the increasing cost and decreasing availability of radioactive waste disposal led the Army Reactor Office (ARO) to reassess disposal options.",
            "USACE developed a management plan for conducting an All Hazards Assessment, which contained provisions for four phases of work. Phase I included a Historical Records Review & Disposal Alternatives Investigation. Phase II included performing a characterisation survey and decommissioning cost estimate, which was completed in 2015. Phases III and IV deal with decommissioning planning, design, and execution. Decommissioning Planning has been completed and USACE has received a Decommissioning Permit from ARO. The total estimate for decommissioning is $243m including estimated costs to implement the project and USACE oversight USACE expects decommissioning efforts at the site to be completed by 2029. The site will then be released to the Garrison for future use.",
            "The remaining materials that have been entombed in concrete or safely stored onsite will now be removed as part of the contract with A3D. As to the contract dispute, KUAC quoted Barber as saying: “We don’t typically comment too much on the protests just because of the sensitivity.” However, according to information on the GAO website, A3D argued that USACE misevaluated the Westinghouse proposal and also failed to engage in adequate, equal discussions with the firm. Westinghouse also failed to identify a retention plan to ensure key personnel would be available for the duration of the project.",
            "Barber said the re-evaluation has delayed the completion date of the project by a year. “We’re finalising some startup-related issues with respect to the contract now,” she said, “and we’re hopeful that work on the site – physical work on the site – is probably still six to eight months out.”",

Slovenian nuclear utility Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško’s (NEK’s) used fuel dry storage facility at Krško NPP was commissioned ahead of schedule in April with the placement by Holtec of the first cask. Placement of the 16th cask marks completion of the first loading campaign Holtec noted. “We thank our partners at NEK for their support in project preparation and execution that led us to such a successful conclusion.”",
            "Transfer to dry storage of the 16 casks containing 592 used fuel rods was supervised by the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (URSJV – Uprava republike Slovenije za jedrsko varnost) and monitored by other authorised organisations. NEK says the dry storage will meet all the conditions needed for extended operation of the Krško NPP for an additional 20 years (to 2043), for which it has a final environmental consent.",
            "Construction of the 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor – first western NPP in eastern Europe – began in 1975 and it began commercial operation in 1983. Construction of the dry storage facility began after Holtec won the contract in 2017.",

The two units were originally expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the project; Oglethorpe Power Corp owns 30%; the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) owns 22.7%; and the city of Dalton owns 1.6%. The units will be operated by Southern Nuclear.",
            "The start of fuel loading at Vogtle 4 began after Southern Nuclear received the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) certifying that the new unit had been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations.",
            "During fuel load, nuclear technicians from Westinghouse and operators from Southern Nuclear will install 157 fuel assemblies into the reactor core. Start-up testing will then begin designed to demonstrate the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Operators will bring the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronise the unit to the grid and systematically raise power to 100%. Vogtle 4 is projected to be in service by the end of 2023 or in the first quarter 2024.",
            "Westinghouse Electric Company congratulated Georgia Power, Southern Nuclear, and other Vogtle project partners on the fuel loading. “Plant Vogtle is well on its way to becoming the largest source of clean energy in the United States, and we are very proud that our advanced, best-in-class AP1000 technology is making it possible.”",

            "PGE PAK Energia Jądrowa (PPEJ) has submitted an application to Poland's Ministry of Climate & Environment for a decision-in-principle on construction of a NPP consisting of at least two Korean-supplied APR1400 reactors in the Patnów-Konin region of Wielkopolska province in central Poland.",
            "PPEJ is a joint special purpose vehicle set up by Polish public company ZE PAK (Zespól Elektrowni Patnów-Adam-Konin) and Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) – both Treasury owned – to implement the project to construct the NPP in Patnów in central Poland. The plant will comprise two Areactors supplied by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). The company was established just five months after the letter of intent was signed in Seoul between PGE, ZE PAK and KHNP. PGE and ZE PAK will each own 50% of the shares in PPEJ, which will secure the interest of the Polish Treasury in the project.",
            "This project is developing in parallel with Poland’s official nuclear power programme. Poland has ambitious nuclear power development plans. In September 2021, it was announced that six large pressurised water reactors with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040 to reduce its reliance on coal. Construction of the first 1.0-1.6 GWe plant was expected to start in 2026 for commissioning in 2033. Subsequent units will be implemented every 2-3 years. In November 2022, the government announced the first plant, with a capacity of 3,750 MWe, would be built in Pomerania using US Westinghouse AP1000 technology. An agreement outlining a plan for delivery of the plant was signed in May by Westinghouse, Bechtel and state-owned Polish utility Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe (PEJ).",
            "In April , PEJ had applied to the Ministry of Climate & Environment for a similar decision for the Westinghouse project and in July the Ministry issued a fundamental decision approving the plan. It formally confirmed that investment in Poland’s first NPP is in the public interest and in line with state energy policy.",
            "PPEJ’s application included a description of project characteristics, indicating the maximum total installed capacity, the planned operating period and details of the APR1400 technology to be used in the construction of the plant. A positive decision will entitle ZE PAK and PGE to apply for a number of further administrative arrangements, such as a siting decision or construction licence.",
            "PGE noted that the application “was submitted after only 10 months from the moment of signing the letter of intent by PGE, ZE PAK and KHNP”.",
            "PPEJ President Jakub Rybicki said: “We believe that in 2035 our nuclear power plant will start operating, which will cover 12% of Poland's current energy demand.\" He added: “We are starting negotiations with our Korean partner regarding the feasibility study, agreements on financing our project and the creation of a Polish-Korean company that will directly lead this process.”",
            "However, currently KHNP is facing a lawsuit filed by Westinghouse in October 2022 alleging intellectual property infringement. Westinghouse insists that KHNP’s APR1400 nuclear reactor is based on Westinghouse technology. KHNP contests this. “After launching its own nuclear programme, Korea gradually built up technology, carrying out research and development projects with long-term plans for over 30 years. Thanks to this process, it gained competence in the design, production and construction of nuclear power plants in order to finally develop her own, independent technology,” the company said.",
            "In the meantime, however, the lawsuit could be an obstacle to export of the APR1400. “The Westinghouse lawsuit has been dragging for a long time and there’s no guarantee of winning the battle,” said Moon Joo-hyun, an energy engineering professor at Dankook University.",
            "Korea, nevertheless, has ambitions to become a major exporter of nuclear technology. KHNP is also competing with Westinghouse and EDF to supply reactors to the Czech Republic. The Yoon Suk Yeol administration pledged to export 10 nuclear plants by 2030 and export nuclear facilities worth $3.73bn by 2027. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy will dispatch 11 commercial attachés this month to promote nuclear plant exports in potential markets such as Egypt, the Netherlands, India, Indonesia and Qatar.",

However, during the audit, it was found that the NPP had failed to provide two documents related to analyses, assessments and calculations important for ensuring safety. Without these, BNRA said it cannot assess the impact of the proposed changes on safety. The agency gave the NPP management until 15 October to provide the missing documents.",

            "NEA says it used information from verifiable public sources mostly from third party references (governments, regulators, financiers, operators). None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing. Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by the NEA and “were given the opportunity to comment on the draft assessments and supplement further information which could be independently verified”.",

However, neither the original document nor its supplement contains projected completion dates, which are a key measure for assessing progress. Moreover, the selection of SMRs chosen seems somewhat random as the two volumes together cover only 42 reactors in 13 countries. By comparison, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022 covers 83 designs under development or construction in 18 countries.",

Southern Nuclear, which like Georgia Power is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Company, has submitted documentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC0 that is required by Southern Nuclear's Combined Operating Licence (COL). This includes all 364 inspections, tests and analyses that have been performed at unit 4 and all acceptance criteria, collectively known as ITAACs.",
            "The company is now awaiting receipt of the 103(g) finding from the NRC documenting that licence acceptance criteria for unit 4 have been met. This will indicate that the unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with its COL and NRC regulations. Once this is received, no further NRC findings are necessary and Southern Nuclear can load fuel and begin the startup sequence.",
            "Preparations for fuel loading are underway. All 157 fuel assemblies required for the operation of the unit 4 have been delivered to the site. Each fuel assembly measuring 14 feet tall was inspected and transferred to the new fuel storage racks before being placed into the used fuel pool where they will be stored until they are loaded into the reactor.",
            "Vogtle 3, the first new reactor to start-up in the USA since 2016, was connected to the electricity grid in April and reached full power on 30 May. However, in June Georgia Power announced that commercial operation of unit 3 had been delayed because of a problem in the hydrogen system that is used to cool its main electrical generator.",
            "Vogtle 3&4 are both 1,117 MWe Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. Units 1&2 (1,215 MWe reactors also supplied by Westinghouse) were completed in 1987 and 1989. In 2009, the US Nuclear Regulatory Authority renewed their licences for an additional 20 years. Georgia Public Service Commission approved the new reactors for the Vogtle expansion that year and construction activities began.",
            "At that time Vogtle 3&4 were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays, including as a result of Westinghouse’s bankruptcy in 2017. The total cost of the project to build Vogtle 3&4 is now put at more than $30bn. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the project; Oglethorpe Power Corp owns 30%; the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG) owns 22.7%; and the city of Dalton owns 1.6%.

            "The CA20 module for unit 4 at China’s Haiyang NPP Shandong province has been hoisted into place. It coincides with the first anniversary of the Haiyang Nuclear Power Phase II project, according to the Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research & Design Institute (SNERDI).",
            "The CA20 module is a box-shaped steel plate wall structure, which is 20.5 metres long, 14.2 metres wide, and 21 metres in height. The module itself weighs 875 tonnes, and the total hoisting weight is about 1,090 tonnes. It is the heaviest component of the CAP1000 reactor. SNERDI said the module is located in zones 5 & 6 of the auxiliary plant, and is part of the used fuel storage, transmission, heat exchange and waste collection facilities.",
            "SNERDI carefully planned and coordinated the installation based on the experience of installing the CA20 component at Haiyang 3 using modular construction to ensure safety and quality. High-precision three-dimensional laser scanning measurement technology was used to generate a three-dimensional visualisation space point cloud model to simulate the hoisting process. This made possible collision analysis to adjust and deal with interference problems, to organise modelling and analysis of the centre of gravity and module levelling.",
            "The smooth placement of the CA20 module at Haiyang 4 “has created good conditions for subsequent continuous construction and guaranteed realisation of the optimal construction period”. SNERDI noted. The CAP1000 reactor design, which is the Chinese version of the Westinghouse AP1000, uses modular construction techniques, enabling large structural modules to be built at factories and then installed at the site.",
            "The Haiyang NPP currently has two operating AP1000 units, and in 2021 two CAP1000 units were approved by China's State Council for Phase II (units 3 & 4) of the plant. First concrete was poured for the nuclear island of Haiyang 3 in July 2022, with that for unit 4 in April this year. The planned construction period for Haiyang 3 & 4 is 56 months.",

            "Great British Nuclear (GBN) is to drive rapid expansion of nuclear power in the UK at an unprecedented scale and pace as the government kickstarts a competition to encourage the development of small modular reactor (SMR) technology. A joint statement from the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero, GBN, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps, and Nuclear Minister Andrew Bowie announced “a massive revival of nuclear power”. This is intended to place the UK “at the forefront of a global race to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper, more secure energy”.",
            "This will boost UK energy security, reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel imports, create more affordable power and grow the economy, with the nuclear industry estimated to generate around £6 billion for the UK economy.",
            "Companies can now register their interest with GBN to participate in a competition to secure funding support to develop their products. “This could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment in small modular reactor (SMR) projects in the UK – demonstrating the government delivering on its priorities to partner with the nuclear industry and jointly spearhead the future of nuclear technologies,” the statement says.",
            "It notes that, unlike conventional reactors built on site, SMRs are smaller, can be made in factories and could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster, and less expensive.",
            "“GBN will play a key role in helping the government hit its ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050 and achieve among the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in Europe, whilst supporting jobs across the country.”",
            "However, the government also “remains committed to the mega projects of Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C and will work with GBN to consider the potential role of further large gigawatt-scale nuclear power plants in the UK energy mix”.",
            "Energy Security Secretary Shapps said, in opening GBN and the competition to develop SMR technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, “we are seeing the first brush strokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come”.",
            "Nuclear Minister Bowie said: “As long-standing pioneers of nuclear, today we’re marking its UK revival with the opening of Great British Nuclear, which will play an essential role in transforming the way we power Britain from Britain.” He added that he looked forward to “seeing the world-class designs submitted from all around the world through the competitive selection process, as the UK takes its place front and centre in the global race to unleash a new generation of nuclear technology”.",
            "Simon Bowen, interim chair of GBN said building on the work done at Hinkley Point and Sizewell, the start of the SMR selection process “signifies a real step forward in delivering the scale of nuclear power that Britain needs for secure, sustainable energy future”.",
            "The government also announced a grant funding package totalling up to £157m ($203m), including:",
            "Up to £77.1m “for companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulation, maximising the chance of small and advanced modular reactors being built during the next Parliament”.",
            "Up to £58m for the further development and design of a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) and next generation fuel that “could provide high temperature heat for hydrogen and other industrial uses alongside nuclear power.",

            "Up to £22.5m to Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation UK in Warrington to further develop the design of a high temperature micro modular reactor, suited to UK industrial demands including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel production;",
            "Up to £15m to National Nuclear laboratory in Warrington to accelerate the design of a high temperature reactor, following its success in Japan;",
            "Up to £16m to National Nuclear Laboratory in Preston to continue to develop sovereign coated particle fuel suitable for high temperature reactors.",
            "A further £22.3m from the Nuclear Fuel Fund will enable eight projects to develop new fuel production and manufacturing capabilities in the UK, driving up energy security and supporting the global move away from Russian fuel. The winning projects include:",
            "Over £10.5m to Westinghouse Springfields nuclear fuel plant in Preston to manufacture more innovative types of nuclear fuel for customers both in the UK and overseas;",

            "Over £1.2m to support MoltexFLEX, a UK molten salt reactor developer based in the North West, to build and operate rigs for the development of molten salt fuel.",
            "Julia Pyke, Joint Managing Director for Sizewell C said the government announcement was “a big vote of confidence in Sizewell C, which will continue the transformation in British nuclear construction started by Hinkley Point C”. Both projects “will form a vital part of the future nuclear fleet, helping to lower carbon emissions and reduce energy costs for British households”.",
            "Tom Greatrex, CEO of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the launch of GBN “marks a new era for nuclear deployment in the UK – helping drive a programme of construction at pace and at scale to strengthen our energy security”. The focus on the SMR selection “will demonstrate the commitment to deployment of innovative technologies and open up new opportunities for the UK industrial supply chain here and abroad” He added: “Britain has an important leadership role in the global nuclear industry, and nowhere more so than in our determination to drive Russia out of the nuclear fuel markets. The government’s Nuclear Fuel Fund will bolster those world-class capabilities that make us uniquely placed to help our allies replace Russian supplies with Western nuclear fuel.”",
            "David Peattie, Nuclear Decommissioning Authority CEO, said decommissioning plays a critical role in the lifecycle of nuclear power generation, “and we are committed to sharing our expertise, resource, and assets to support GBN and the government in delivering for the British public”.",
            "GBN, will initially be led by Simon Bowen and Gwen Parry-Jones, interim Chair and CEO. Following the launch of the SMR selection process, once the initial stage is complete, “GBN will down-select those technologies which have met the criteria, and then enter into detailed discussions with those companies as part of an Invitation to Negotiate phase. The initial down-select will take place in the Autumn.”"

            "JAVYS is a state-owned joint-stock company under the Economy Ministry and a 51% shareholder in subsidiary Jadrová Energetická Spoločnosť Slovenska (JESS) with Czech utility ČEZ holding 49%. JESS was formed in December 2009 specifically to build and operate a new NPP at Slovakia’s Bohunice site.",
            "JAVYS said that, precisely because, as a shareholder of JESS, it is responsible for the construction of a new nuclear power source, it is trying not only to evaluate all available technologies, “but also to process professional materials that can later be used by the Slovak government as part of the decision-making process on the type and size of the new nuclear power source”.",
            "JAVYS Chairman & CEO Dr Pavel Štuller said: \"The signing of the memoranda is the result of mutual negotiations, the ambition of which is to create a space for cooperation for detailed technical and business discussions and review of cooperation in the next steps towards the implementation of SMR and AP1000 technology in Slovakia.”",
            "He added that the MOUs create “a framework for cooperation between the two companies in the implementation of future development projects in the field of small modular reactors and nuclear power”. He added: “Of course, we expect, above all, a wider exchange of information in the field of new technologies so that we can assess their suitability for inclusion in the Slovak energy network. Signing memoranda does not create any exclusivity, because we want to develop similar relationships with other companies. But they are the basis for the fact that once the Government of the Slovak Republic takes a decision on the location and type of a new nuclear source, we want to be a responsible manager of this process so that we can evaluate the possible benefits of the types of reactors offered by Westinghouse.”",
            "Štuller noted JAVYS’s “rich experience with Westinghouse” in  collaborating on specific projects related to the decommissioning of NPPs in Jaslovské Bohunice. “In addition, Westinghouse is involved in and contributes to the processes of diversification of fresh nuclear fuel for reactors in Slovakia, thus representing, from our perspective, a company that covers the entire nuclear cycle,” he said.",
            "Westinghouse President David Durham said the company was “very excited to work with the JAVYS team to secure their energy future by sharing information about our advanced and proven AP1000 and AP300 reactor technologies”.",
            "The AP1000 is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor (PWR) with fully passive safety systems. Currently, the AP1000 is not licensed or operating anywhere in Europe. In the USA two AP1000 reactors are under construction at the Vogtle NPP in Georgia but are significantly delayed and over budget. Two Westinghouse AP1000 units are in operation at China’s Sanmen and Haiyang NPPs, and two CAP1000 units, the Chinese version of the AP1000, are being built as the second phase of each station. Three AP1000 units have recently been selected in Poland and nine others are planned in Ukraine as well as one in Bulgaria. Westinghouse also claims that \"the technology is under consideration at multiple other sites in Central and Eastern Europe, the United Kingdom and in the United States\".",
            "The AP300 SMR was launched by Westinghouse in May. It is a single-loop PWR based on the AP1000 technology. Westinghouse is aiming to get design certification by 2027, with construction of a first unit beginning in 2030 for operation in 2033.",
            "Gautam Rana, US Ambassador to Slovakia, who attended the signing event, said the two MOUs laid the groundwork for closer commercial cooperation between the two companies in the field of civil nuclear energy. “This represents another milestone in the joint efforts of the US and Slovak governments to achieve energy security and sustainability in Slovakia with a perspective focus on world-class technologies,\" he said.",
            "In June, the Slovak Ministry of Economy and power utility Slovenské Elektrárne (SE) signed a memorandum of cooperation with several companies to support the development of SMRs, by applying for funding from the USA's Project Phoenix. The companies included US Steel Košice, the Slovak Electricity Transmission System, VUJE, the Office of Nuclear Supervision and the Slovak Technical University in Bratislava.",

These aim to promote transatlantic cooperation to deploy SMRs in Europe and Eurasia.",
            "Slovakia operates four nuclear power units at two NPP sites – Mochovce 1&2 and Bohunice 3&4 – which generate half its electricity. Mochovce 3 was connected to the grid earlier in February and Mochovce 4, still under construction, is expected to be connected next year. In February JESS applied to the Slovak Nuclear Regulatory Authority for a siting permit for a new nuclear power plant near the existing Bohunice plant.",

These include five NPP operators – ČEZ (Czech Republic), Ukraine’s Energoatom; Fortum (Finland), Paks NPP (Hungary), and Slovenske Elektrarne (Slovakia); two fuel manufacturers – Westinghouse Sweden and Enusa (Spain); and five fuel engineering & research organisations – Joint Research Centre-European Commission (Belgium), State Scientific & Technical Centre for Nuclear & Radiation Safety (Ukraine), ÚJV Řež (Czech Republic), Uppsala University (Sweden) and VUJE (Slovakia).",
            "The APIS project brings together countries with experience in adapting VVERs to use Western-designed fuel as well as those just embarking on nuclear fuel diversification. There are currently over 30 reactors of VVER-440 and VVER-1000 design operating in the EU and in Ukraine.",
            "Tarik Choho, Westinghouse Nuclear Fuel President, said: \"The APIS project is a strong collaboration between suppliers and utilities, fostered by the EU, to mitigate the current supply chain risk and reduce dependence on VVER fuel supply from Russia.\"",
            "He added that Westinghouse’s fuel technology \"is the only available technology fully independent from Russian technology\" and said the company is “deeply committed to offer, together with its partners, improved fuel designs and services with an even wider scope”.",
            "In January Westinghouse signed a 10-year contract to fabricate and deliver VVER-1000 nuclear fuel to Kozloduy unit 5 in Bulgaria from 2025. It has already has supplied VVER fuel to Ukraine for more than a decade, although the switch from Russian TVEL fuel was not without its problems. Energoatom launched a project for the qualification of Westinghouse fuel in 2000, and in 2008 Energoatom and Westinghouse Electric Sweden signed a contract to ship fuel to three or six Ukrainian reactors between 2011 and 2015.",
            "However, during trial use at South Ukraine in 2012, some fuel became deformed and Ukraine later suspended use of the Westinghouse fuel pending its redesign. Following Ukraine's change of government in 2014, the contract was revived and extended. After problems developed with the fuel, it was structurally modified and modernised. Westinghouse experienced similar problems with its initial supplies of VVER-1000 fuel to Temelin NPP in the Czech Republic. In 2009 Temelin cut short its contract with Westinghouse and reverted to TVEL fuel, until 2019 when redesigned Westinghouse assemblies were again tried.",
            "In March Westinghouse signed an agreement to supply VVER-440 fuel assemblies from next year for the Dukovany NPP in the Czech Republic, although as yet the fuel is still in the design stage. Finland sourced fuel from Westinghouse (then part of BNFL) for its two VVER-440 units at Loviisa from 2001 to 2007, after which it switched to Russian TVEL fuel. Westinghouse then shut down its manufacture of VVER-440 fuel and is now in the process of redesign in collaboration with Enusa. A production line for the new fuel at Enusa’s Juzbado factory is now expected to be licensed this year, allowing fuel deliveries early in 2024.",

            "The objective of the APIS programme is to create security of supply of nuclear fuel for Russian designed pressurised water reactors (VVER) operating in the EU and Ukraine. According to the APIS website: “Due to the situation in Ukraine and the fast transition from Russian to Western fuel design, work must be accelerated to be able to handle the situation that has arisen. The western design of fuel is hence introduced stepwise: emergent VVER-440 fuel designs for European energy security for delivery to Ukrainian power plant in year 2023, followed by a fuel design with improved economics for operation in all European plants without restrictions, and lastly next generation of fuel design.”",
            "The expected result of the Apis project is:",

            "Westinghouse Electric Company says it has submitted the first set of Vendor Design Review (VDR) documents to the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) for its eVinci microreactor. The VDR is not a required part of the licensing process for a new nuclear power plant, but aims to verify the acceptability of a design with respect to Canadian nuclear regulatory requirements and expectations. Its purpose is to enable early identification and resolution of potential regulatory and technical issues as the eVinci technology advances through the design process.",
            "Westinghouse applied to CNSC in 2018 for a VDR of the eVinci and a service agreement was signed with CNSC in September 2022, initiating the process. The three phases of the VDR process involve a pre-licensing assessment of compliance with regulatory requirements; an assessment of potential fundamental barriers to licensing; and a follow-up phase in which the vendor can respond to findings from the second phase.",
            "Westinghouse is executing both Phases 1 and 2 of the VDR as a combined programme. It has provided four Phase 1 Focus Area submissions to CNSC and, overall, more than 40 submissions will be filed during Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the VDR process.",
            "In addition, Westinghouse plans to submit reports for joint review under the Memorandum of Cooperation between the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the CNSC. The reports will focus on selected design aspects of the eVinci microreactor with the primary objective of establishing alignment and a common understanding on regulatory expectations.",
            "In February this year, Westinghouse filed a Notice of Intent to submit key licensing reports for eVinci to the NRC and the CNSC for joint review including a common set of key requirements for the classification of systems, structures and components for the microreactor. This will enable deployment of a standard design in both the USA and Canada.",
            "In December 2021, Westinghouse submitted a pre-application regulatory engagement plan (REP) to NRC for the microreactor, outlining planned pre-licensing application interactions. A REP supports early interactions with NRC staff and can reduce regulatory uncertainty and add predictability to licensing advanced technologies.",
            "Jon Ball, Westinghouse President for eVinci Microreactor says taking these first steps with the regulator marks an important milestone to accelerate development of the technology.",
            "The eVinci microreactor is a transportable reactor that is fully factory built, fuelled and assembled, and capable of delivering combined heat (up to 13 MWt) and power (up to 5 MWe). Its small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment, with superior reliability and minimal maintenance, making it suitable for use in remote locations. It will use TRISO fuel. It is one of several advanced reactor designs being supported through ARDP to help accelerate the development and deployment of new reactor technologies.",

The two ministers noted that the MOU aims at broad development of energy cooperation “to support the economic and infrastructural development of the whole region”. The MOU provides for cooperation in nuclear energy, gas, green energy and energy transition including smart networks.",
            "The two sides will exchange scientific, technical, engineering and operational experience, stimulate cooperation between energy companies and relevant institutions in both countries. Ukraine also expressed interested in the possibilities for delivery of liquefied natural gas through Bulgaria and its storage, as well as in increasing the capacity of electricity connectivity and opportunities for trade.",
            "Ukraine's Energy Ministry said: \"The parties will intensify the provision of expert and engineering services and solutions in the field of nuclear energy by conducting independent expertise on the assessment of the safety of nuclear facilities and exchange of experts, access to infrastructure and participation in joint projects and initiatives involving joint activities in the field of nuclear energy.\" Both sides will promote \"cooperation at all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, the implementation of activities and the provision of services related to the extension of the operational life of nuclear facilities, with the aim of increasing safety and/or improving their operational characteristics\".",
            "The MOU would also lead to the \"exchange of knowledge and experience regarding the protection of energy infrastructure from physical, electromagnetic and cyber threats is also identified as a priority in cooperation\".",
            "A working group was set up, which held its first meeting the following day led by the two ministers accompanies by experts and representatives of energy companies from both countries. The meeting saw the start of negotiations on the possible sale to Ukraine of equipment manufactured for Bulgaria’s aborted Belene NPP, in accordance with a decision adopted that day by the Bulgarian National Assembly.",
            "The Belene project envisaged the construction of two Russian VVER-1000/V-466 reactors and preliminary site works began in 2008 with the support of the government led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). Contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers. The plant was to be built by Atomstroyexport (part of Rosatom) after Russia won an international tender in 2006 but the project was cancelled in 2012, after a change of government. It was revived, again, in 2018 after a series of arbitration procedures, which saw Bulgaria pay €601.6 million ($691.5m) in compensation to Atomstroyexport for the equipment already manufactured. These components are now stored at the construction site and were also considered for use in expanding the Kozloduy NPP.",
            "However, in June US-based Westinghouse Electric Company signed a Front-End Engineering & Design (FEED) contract with Kozloduy NPP-Newbuild for a AP1000 reactor to be constructed at the Kozloduy NPP site. Westinghouse said work was starting to assess Bulgarian industry and existing infrastructure at the Kozloduy site for its potential to host an AP1000 reactor.",
            "The issue had been rushed through parliament in anticipation of Zelensky’s visit. The decision, which effectively ends any hopes of reviving the Belene project, was adopted by 155 votes to 57 with opposition coming from the BSP and its allies. Ukraine had requested in March that Bulgaria should hand over the equipment. The decision said the price sought from a possible sale of the equipment to Ukraine should not be less than the €601.6m paid in compensation to Russia in 2016.",
            "The decision specified a deadline of 60 days for the transaction to be completed, although the sale process is likely to take months due to purely technical details. Bulgaria is expected to receive at least $1.2bn. Even if Ukraine does not want to buy all the equipment currently stored on site in Moscow, Kiev will have to pay the entire amount.",
            "The negotiations will continue in different formats within a work schedule based on the time limits set by the decision of the Bulgarian Parliament. Bulgaria’s Energy Ministry noted: “Bulgaria has partially supplied equipment, which is not enough to build a whole new capacity. The dynamics in the energy sector is such that Bulgaria cannot afford to engage in a long, expensive and vague project. It must move quickly in line with the common European energy market and invest in realisable new alternative capacity. Ukraine has a serious interest in Bulgarian equipment, which it needs to compensate for lost energy capacity, including due to the temporary occupation of the nuclear Zaporizhia NPP.”",
            "Halushchenko said the working group meeting was an important step in renewing relations between the countries in energy and a step towards realising the potential of bilateral cooperation. “Our meeting opens a new page of cooperation in the field of energy, especially nuclear and, in the future, renewable. I am convinced that we will soon demonstrate the effective and fruitful interaction of our countries,” he noted.",
            "Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said during a joint press conference with Zelenskyi in Sofia that “many technical, financial and economic” aspects of the proposed reactor equipment deal remain to be discussed. “This is only the beginning of negotiations”, he noted.",
            "To make the purchase easier for Ukraine, the EU Commission announced that the potential deal could be financed with money the EU is already sending to Kyiv. “Ukraine can use EU funds to buy nuclear reactors from Bulgaria, as this would help strengthen the Ukrainian economy”, Commission spokesman Eric Mamer said.

            "Some eighteen months after discovery of the first indications of stress corrosion cracking (SCC) in stainless steel safety system piping at its 1450 MW-class Civaux 1 (N4 type) reactor, Electricité de France believes it has mastered treatment of the problem, although it will still take several years to fully resolve.",
            "The utility recently confirmed its forecast of 300-330 TWh output from its nuclear reactors this year, compared to 279 TWh in 2022 – despite detection earlier this year of new cracking mechanisms, SCC and thermal fatigue affecting welds that were repaired during original construction.",
            "This will require inspections of hundreds of such welds throughout the French PWR fleet and safety authority ASN says it “considers that the discovery of a thermal fatigue defect among the major defects characterised recently, on a weld on which this damage mode was not expected, requires further analyses.”",
            "The original stress corrosion cracking phenomenon (See Figure 1) has been found to most affect EDF’s larger reactors, the 1450-MW-class N4 series (four reactor units, including Civaux 1) and the 1300 MW-class P’4 series (12 reactors). It required immediate action because of the safety functions of the affected systems: the safety injection system (used in emergencies to inject borated water into the core) and the residual heat removal system (used to remove decay heat generated by a shutdown reactor). Both are connected directly to the pressure vessel that contains the fuel elements and pressurised water coolant.",
            "Inspection and repair outages stemming from the generic SCC found initially in October 2021 shaved 81.7 TWh off the 2022 output of EDF’s nuclear fleet. To meet demand, EDF was obliged to buy power on the European market during a period of very high prices, costing the group an estimated EUR29bn and contributing to a record net loss (Ebitda) of EUR 17.9bn for 2022.",
            "The flaw indications were found by ultrasonic inspection (UT) on the inner diameter of pipes within the safety systems, both in the base metal and adjacent to the welds, during mandatory checks carried out every 10 years. Their propagation was intergranular (the phenomenon is known as IGSCC in the US). The UT checks were originally meant to detect the presence of cracking by thermal fatigue, which is a known phenomenon for stainless steel lines in the affected lines; stress corrosion cracking was not expected in these locations.",
            "After the discovery at Civaux 1, EDF ran additional checks on the other three N4 units (one at Civaux and two at Chooz). These revealed flaw indications that had been classified as spurious in UT inspections during previous decennial outages.",
            "The defects in the safety injection system pipework do not affect normal operation, but since the defective zones are located between the reactor vessel and the first isolation valve, rupture of the piping – for example, in the event cold water was injected to cool the core – could lead to loss of coolant. However, both EDF and safety authorities have said that redundant systems would have ensured reactor cooling even had the faulty piping failed.",
            "EDF’s response to the findings was massive. After the first flaw was discovered, EDF cut out all four pipe elbows at Civaux 1 and subjected them to destructive examination and lab analysis.",
            "Meanwhile, EDF had found similar flaw indications at Penly 1, a 1300 MW-class P’4 unit that was undergoing its 30th-year outage.",
            "After initial analysis of the phenomenon, EDF identified 12 reactors considered most sensitive to the SCC – the four N4 units, plus Penly 1 and Golfech 1 (another P’4 unit) and six more 1300 MW units – and pulled them from the grid for inspections.",
            "The results of those checks led to the conclusion that the cracking was due to thermal stratification, Hubert Catalette, deputy director of EDF’s nuclear generation division in charge of the SCC recovery project, told a French Nuclear Energy Society conference in Paris on 29 March.",
            "Thermal stratification, a separation of warmer and cooler flows within the lines, created high stresses on the U-shaped piping which led to cracking in pipe elbows adjacent to welds.",
            "Catalette said that the stratification created both constant and variable stresses and was “a consequence of a vortex penetration associated with the geometry”, that is, the layout, of the piping.",
            "EDF’s chosen strategy is “massive preventive replacement” of the sensitive pipe sections on the P’4 series, Catalette said, calling it “much more efficient” than other alternatives. But IGSCC can have multiple causes, and Catalette noted that welding parameters are also being “optimised” in replacement pipe sections to minimise residual stresses.",
            "EDF is, however, studying an “overlay” repair method that was suggested by international experts invited to review its response to the SCC problem, Cedric Lewandowski, EDF executive director in charge of nuclear and thermal generation, told the French parliament’s technology assessment office during a hearing in October 2022.",
            "Lewandowski also praised contractors who stepped up to the plate to supply EDF with piping and skilled manpower, including forges and foundries in Italy and welders from France and North America.",
            "As of late March, treatment of the 16 reactors (four N4 and twelve P’4) most sensitive to the SCC phenomenon (because of their piping layout) was “underway or finished,” Catalette said.",
            "To that date, 450 pipe elbows had been delivered, 340 of them installed, and 320 meters of straight pipe sections had been replaced, he said, and 200 laboratory analyses had been carried out.",
            "EDF’s strategy for inspecting and repairing, if necessary, all 56 PWR units in its fleet was approved by ASN last July. Thanks to record fast development of the new ultrasound technique that can detect cracks through 3 cm of pipe wall, EDF has begun to inspect the incriminated circuits as part of planned maintenance programmes.",
            "Repaired welds under scrutiny",
            "The flaw indications found this year pose a different problem: they are on straight pipe sections not subject to thermal stratification. The first, a very deep flaw attributed to SCC, was found on a pipe section that had been cut out of Penly 1 and analysed early this year, EDF said in an information note published on 6 March. The second was detected on SIS piping of Penly 2, with a depth of 12 mm. Both flaws are deeper than the critical defect calculated for these lines. EDF said the Penly 2 crack was caused by thermal fatigue and that similar flaw indications were found on piping from Cattenom 3.",
            "In an information notice published 14 March ASN reports that the SSC crack at Penly 1 extends over about a quarter of the pipe circumference and its maximum depth is 23 mm, for a pipe wall thickness of 27 mm. “The presence of this crack means that the strength of this pipe is no longer demonstrated,” ASN concluded, adding that however rupture of one of these lines is taken into account in the reactor safety case.",
            "The Institute of Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, IRSN, which serves as technical support for ASN, said in a separate information note, dated March 16, that the weld affected by the deep crack at Penly 1 had been repaired twice during initial construction of the reactor, first to correct the alignment of the pipe sections and again to correct a welding defect.",
            "EDF is implementing an inspection programme on the repaired welds of the SIS and RHR systems, said ASN, with more than 150 welds having undergone laboratory assessments. The inspection programme is to cover all EDF reactors this year, it said.",
            "EDF has already drawn up an “exhaustive inventory” of welds on its reactor fleet that underwent repairs during the construction phase, allowing their categorisation according to susceptibility to the cracking phenomenon, EDF’s Catalette noted.",
            "The inventory found a total of 320 welds on SIS and RHR systems that had been repaired during construction; 69 of them were found to be highly sensitive to SCC, notably those repaired twice, he said.",
            "A revised strategy submitted to ASN on 10 March proposed a schedule for prioritising weld inspections and/ or pipe replacements to deal with the repaired-weld issue. As of late March, a total of 124 welds either had already been checked or were already destined to be scrapped because they are on P’4 pipe circuits slated for preventive replacement, Catalette said.",
            "Under the proposed strategy, 92% of the “most sensitive” welds and 58% of the other repaired welds will have been checked by the end of 2023, he said. Next year, 100% of the most sensitive welds and 87% of the others will be checked. By the end of 2025, all the repaired welds on EDF’s fleet will have been inspected and the piping replaced if necessary.",
            "ASN said in an information note published 25 April that it had agreed to EDF’s proposed strategy, including the priority for inspecting the lines considered most vulnerable to cracking. The technical dialogue that preceded that decision, ASN said, had focused among other issues on reactors with repaired welds on two different auxiliary piping lines, namely Nogent 1 (a 1300 MW unit) and Cruas 2 (a 900 MW unit). At ASN’s behest, EDF had conducted more detailed investigations of the potential flaws on the lines and analysed the safety consequences of simultaneous ruptures of two auxiliary lines on the same reactor, the regulator said.",
            "ASN added that EDF had implemented “supplementary operating measures” aiming to avoid operational situations that would put large strains on the welds in question, as well as measures to rapidly detect leaks if they should occur. The measures, ASN said, would be in place until the next planned outages of Nogent 1 and Cruas 2, in September 2023.",
            "In a letter to EDF dated 30 March, ASN noted that the utility had committed to submit to regulators a further inspection programme covering austenitic steel lines – other than those in the safety injection and residual heat removal systems – that contain repaired welds.",
            "Among other details in the letter, ASN said its advisory group for nuclear pressure equipment will meet on 25 and 26 May to consider EDF’s proposed strategy for maintaining welds with flaw indications “as is” – ie, not repairing or removing the lines – for more than one operating cycle. It is clear that the regulators – who did acknowledge",
            "EDF’s major effort in response to the cracking issues, notably the quick development of an effective non-destructive examination (UT) tool – will continue to keep a close eye on the utility’s repair and replacement strategy as well as its justification for keeping reactors with flaw indications online for any lengthy period.",
            "Usefulness of periodic inspections",
            "The discovery of these unexpected phenomena has posed questions about changes made to reactor designs licensed to France by the US supplier Westinghouse in the 1970s and 1980s. No IGSCC has been detected in analogous welds on US PWRs, although thermal fatigue cracking has been found by UT on ten of those units, according to a 2022 presentation by Carol Moyer of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s Nuclear Reactor Regulation division.",
            "But it also underlines the usefulness of obligatory periodic in-depth inspections as practiced on the French reactor fleet. The crack indications had gone unnoticed in the previous inspections 10 years ago because inspection techniques were not adapted to detecting SCC on the stainless-steel lines. The initial SCC indications were discovered first at the 20th-year outage of Civaux-1 and then during the 30th-year outages of the P’4 series units.",
            "EDF has determined that the layout of safety systems piping on the 32 reactor units of its 900-MW-class reactor series and the eight units of the P4 series (Paluel, Flamanville and Saint-Alban) makes them much less vulnerable to SCC than the more recent series. The P4 units were the first built to the 1300-MW-class design under Westinghouse licence, followed by the P’4 series with slight design changes (Belleville, Cattenom, Golfech, Nogent-sur-Seine and Penly). According to two French nuclear industry veterans, French designers had been asked to make the lines more compact in an effort to trim construction costs.",
            "Combined with already planned long decennial outages, the SCC-related downtime shaved EDF’s generation in 2022 to the lowest output since 1992, 279 TWh (as already noted), compared to 360.7 TWh in 2021. At one point, only 25 of the 56 nuclear generating units were online, and the utility had trouble meeting its targets for returning units to the grid as reactors undergoing SCC-related outages missed restart dates.",
            "According to grid company RTE, the SCC issue was the second largest factor contributing to reactor unavailability in 2022, with a capacity loss equivalent to 10.2 GW. Planned maintenance accounted for 10.5 GW capacity loss, including the major programme supporting long-term operation of older units, called the “Grand Carénage” or “major overhaul” which involves long outages. Maintenance shifted in time due to Covid took out 2.8 GW, and 3.9 GW was lost for various other reasons (including around 1% due to cooling water issues in dry weather). Altogether, these factors meant that EDF had only 34.1 GW available on average in 2022, compared to a nominal capacity of 61.4 GW.",
            "The nuclear fleet’s availability continued to be impacted in first-quarter 2023, with available capacity down 7.4% as of 31 March compared to the same period in 2022, according to EDF. However, as of 10 May, all N4 units were back on line."

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company has signed a contract extension with EDF Energy Nuclear Generation Limited (NGL) to supply fuel for the UK’s Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGRs) from its Springfields fuel fabrication facility in the UK.",
            "NGL will continue to generate electricity at its four operational AGR NPPs at Heysham (units 1&2), Torness, and Hartlepool. Springfields is the UK’s only commercial fuel fabrication facility, and produces fuel for its NPPs.",
            "Mark Hartley, Managing Director of EDF Energy’s Generation business said: \"It has never been more important that the UK has a secure, affordable supply of low carbon electricity. EDF is working hard to make sure the AGR fleet continues to be an important part of that supply for as long as possible and signing this agreement with Westinghouse is a key part of that work.\"",
            "\"We are delighted to reach this agreement with NGL which further reinforces an already strong partnership established over 40 years ago when the Springfields site manufactured the initial fuel for the UK’s first commercial AGR,\" said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. \"We are proud of this legacy and that the Springfields team can provide ongoing services and support to the AGR stations for the years to come.\"",
            "Fuel fabrication at Springfields began in 946 under the direction of the Ministry of Supply and it produced its first uranium fuel in 1948, becoming the world’s first commercial nuclear fuel manufacturing facility. Responsibility for the site was passed from the Ministry of Supply to the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, then to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), which acquired US-based Westinghouse in 1999. In 2010 Springfields Fuels Ltd (SFL) was created to run the site on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which was taking over many of BNFL’s operations. BNFL was abolished in 2016. SFL was operated by Westinghouse Electric UK, which subsequently acquired a long-term lease for the site and transferred responsibility for the commercial fuel manufacturing business and Springfields Fuels Ltd to Westinghouse.",

            "The US reaffirmed its support for Indian membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) during a state visit to Washington by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A joint statement by Modi and US President Joe Biden covered a wide range of subjects, with nuclear only mentioned in one (para 22). It said: “Prime Minister Modi underscored the important role nuclear energy plays in global decarbonisation efforts and affirmed nuclear energy as a necessary resource to meet our nations’ climate, energy transition, and energy security needs.”",
            "The leaders noted ongoing negotiations between the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) and Westinghouse Electric Company (WEC) for the construction of six nuclear reactors in India. They welcomed intensified consultations between the US Department of Energy (DOE) and India’s Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) “for facilitating opportunities for WEC to develop a techno-commercial offer for the Kovvada nuclear project”. They also noted the ongoing discussion on developing next generation small modular reactor technologies in a collaborative mode for the domestic market as well as for export. Finally, “the United States reaffirms its support for India’s membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group and commits to continue engagement with like-minded partners to advance this goal.”",
            "In March 2019, India and the US issued a joint statement agreeing to strengthen security and civil nuclear cooperation, including the construction of six US nuclear power units. This followed a visit to India by Andrea Thompson, the US undersecretary of state for arms control and international security.",
            "Westinghouse has been negotiating to build reactors in India for years, but concerns about India’s nuclear liability laws and Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing in 2017 have led to delays. In 2018, US Energy Secretary Rick Perry expressed strong support for the Westinghouse project, which envisaged building six AP1000 reactors in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Kovvada was selected chosen for the construction of six Westinghouse AP1000s reactors but contractual arrangements have not yet been finalised.",
            "The agreement to build US reactors, initially announced in 2016, was only made possible by a US-India civil nuclear agreement signed in 2008. This, in turn, led to the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) giving a special waiver to India, which has not signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and so was excluded. The NSG was created after India’s nuclear weapons test in 1974 after which it became impossible for India to import any nuclear technology, forcing it to focus on indigenous nuclear development.",
            "NSG guidelines contain the “Non-Proliferation Principle,” adopted in 1994, whereby a supplier, regardless of other provisions in the guidelines, can only authorise a transfer of nuclear material or equipment provided it is satisfied that the transfer would not contribute to weapons proliferation. Long-running negotiations to include India as a full-fledged NSG member have stalled on Chinese opposition. However, the waiver has enabled India to sign civil nuclear cooperation agreements with numerous countries.",
            "However, India’s nuclear liability regime has remained a stumbling block for France and the USA. Following the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy which killed at least 4,000 and left another 4,000 severely disabled, and for which no adequate compensation has ever been paid by the US companies involved, India’s parliament passed a law, making equipment suppliers responsible for any accident. India adopted a Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act in 2010 making Indian operators primarily liable for any nuclear accident, but leaving open the possibility of recourse to suppliers. A compromise on liability was reached with Russia, which proceeded with construction at the Kudankulam NPP. An insurance scheme was then put in place offering suppliers some further protection, but the USA is still hesitant.",
            "India currently has 22 reactors in operation with a total net capacity of around 6780 MWe, which generate about 3% of the country’s electricity. It is hoping to increase this almost threefold to a total capacity of 22,480 MW by 2031, and to include small modular reactors (SMRs).",

PEJ said the agreement “sets out a plan for the delivery of the project and confirms the implementation of the next major stage of Poland's flagship nuclear energy initiative”. The Polish government selected the Westinghouse AP1000 reactor technology for its first-ever nuclear energy programme in November. Significant licensing and engineering work is already underway on the project, PEJ noted, adding that the new agreement “lays the foundation for the design activity to start later this year and the construction contract in 2025”.",
            "“An American consortium of highly experienced companies in the nuclear industry is being established, with the goal of designing and building the first NPP in Poland,” said PEJ acting President Łukasz Młynarkiewicz. “As an investor, we will actively cooperate with this consortium to consistently achieve successive milestones in the project until the power plant in Pomerania is commissioned”.",
            "Westinghouse said the agreement sets the scope of responsibility and defines the most important rules and conditions that partners are to follow as part of the implementation of the project for Poland’s first NPP. “It also specifies that both American companies will work together, including in areas such as designing a nuclear facility, implementing the assumed work schedule, project control and ensuring its quality. The consortium leader at the power plant design stage will be Westinghouse, and during construction, Bechtel.”",
            "Anna Moskwa, Polish Minister of Climate & Environment, noted: “We are even closer to building a nuclear power plant in 2026 and producing nuclear energy in 2033. This will allow us to achieve the goal of a quarter of energy production in the Polish energy system from nuclear energy in 2040.” She said she appreciated that the project",
            "was open to Polish contribution – “of the Polish economy, Polish entrepreneurs, Polish services and the involvement of Polish employees”, adding, “We are preparing for this challenge.”",

Unit 3 was finally connected to the grid in April and unit 4 is nearing completion. However, both are significantly delayed and overbudget. When construction began in 2009 they were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017. Cost has more than doubled.",

The proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at China’s Lufeng NPP was approved by the National Development & Reform Commission but has not yet received State Council approval. Plans to build further AP1000 units in China, however, have been dropped in favour of Chinese Hualong-One units.",

At the same time, we are conducting talks with financial institutions. In its offer, the US government has included the participation of US financial institutions that support such projects, but we are also considering other options.”",
            "He said commissioning the first unit in 2033 was possible but difficult and would face problems. “Nuclear power is a very capital-intensive undertaking and therefore the financial costs of such an investment are of great importance for the final energy price. That is why we are considering mechanisms that will minimise risks from the point of view of investors, financing institutions, yes, to minimise financial costs and ensure energy supply for our economy at the lowest possible price.” He said Poland was not “prejudging” what the financial model would be. “There are several possibilities here. In this context, it is also necessary to mention the discussion that is taking place at EU level, where the European Commission has proposed some solutions as part of the electricity market reform. These create a framework for price support for all investments in the energy sector. This is also an element that we will have to consider when designing appropriate solutions.”",
            "He also stressed the importance of Polish participation in NPP construction. The Polish Nuclear Power Industry Programme from 2020 assumed that during the construction of the first nuclear unit in Poland 40% the value of the work will be done by Polish companies. This indicator was also transferred to Poland's Energy Policy until 2040, which was created a few months later. However, the Polish government will not be able to impose regulations forcing technology suppliers to employ Polish companies in sufficient numbers. “EU law does not allow such an obligation to be written directly, but we can certainly assume that there are a number of construction works, where Polish companies will be able to submit the most competitive offers,” he said.",
            "He recalled that that different technology suppliers for various nuclear projects talk about the possible participation of Polish industry from 40-80% for subsequent reactors. “So the level of about 50% is realistic.” He added: “The most important thing in a nuclear project is, of course, ensuring an adequate level of safety, and therefore we offer interested companies the opportunity to train staff by creating appropriate training programmes. In cooperation with the US government, we are working on a staff training centre.” The Ministry of Climate & the Environment has identified about 80 Polish companies that have participated in nuclear projects in the world over the past 10 years – in the UK, Finland or the United Arab Emirates. There are also over 300 companies that have the appropriate skills and certificates to participate in a nuclear project in Poland. “We need to mobilise even more companies through the education programme,” Guibourgé-Czetwertyński noted.",
            "Another important element is the possibility for Polish industry to be involved in other nuclear projects that will be implemented in Europe as more European countries considering investing in large NPPs or small modular reactors. “If our companies are able to prove their ability to implement the Polish nuclear project, they will also have a chance to work on other projects in Europe,” he pointed out.",

            "A new report by US Idaho National Laboratory (INL) sees a high market potential for microreactors in US states with energy-intensive industries, nuclear-friendly laws and widespread social acceptance. The 164-page “Microreactor Applications in US Markets” looks at state-level legal, regulatory, economic and technology implications for microreactor applications in US markets.",
            "This report is part of the Emerging Energy Markets Analysis (EMA) initiative led by INL and includes the University of Alaska, Boise State University, University of Michigan, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Wyoming. It summarises a US Department of Energy (DOE) Microreactor Program analysis of the market opportunities for microreactors.",
            "The EMA team examined the regulatory climate in all 50 US states and found that most have either removed barriers for microreactor (MR) deployment or established carbon-reduction goals that make advanced nuclear technologies attractive. Challenges include public perceptions based on uncertainties related to costs, waste and fuel management.",
            "A key focus is on Alaska and Wyoming where there are location-specific energy needs for electricity and heat. A state-by-state evaluation of current carbon/carbon-related policies and nuclear policies assesses broader market applicability in states undergoing energy transitions. MRs are suited for remote industrial applications such as seafood processing in Alaska and trona mineral mining in Wyoming, the report says.",
            "The report suggests that the nuclear industry and national labs should increase communication about the technology and create a clear differentiation between MRs, small modular reactors and large reactors. It outlines areas needing further research, including developing a deeper understanding of public acceptance or resistance to microreactors. It says there is also a need to: evaluate other possible microreactor markets including conventional mining, oil and gas extraction operations, carbon refining, ammonia production, synthetic fuels, and other industries.",
            "\"Microreactors are a new technology to many of the potential deployment sites, so it is important to promote common understanding of the barriers to market entry for both developers of the technology as well as end users,\" said John Jackson, national technical director of the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy's Microreactor Program. \"The DOE programmes support broad availability of energy solutions to meet individual needs, and characterisation of these needs is very valuable.\"",

This comes after the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) in April concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for Canadian commercial use. The decision followed a systematic and multi-year review against Canadian regulatory requirements. It was the first regulatory review of a nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.",
            "US Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr Kathryn Huff said the industry funding opportunity “vitally assists in reducing technical and economic challenges associated with current and future nuclear technologies”. She added: “This final round of awards supports technological advancements to ensure nuclear energy keeps delivering emissions-free power for all Americans.”",
            "Simon Irish, CEO of Terrestrial Energy said DOE’s support for the IMSR licensing programme with the NRC is well timed in the wake of the Canadian decision. “This DOE regulatory assistance grant helps accelerate our NRC licensing activities,” he noted.",
            "In June 2022, the NRC and the CNSC completed a joint technical review of the IMSR as part of the 2019 inter-agency Memorandum of Cooperation to accelerate the licensing of Generation IV nuclear plants for commercial use. The agreement’s collaborative technical reviews aim to increase regulatory effectiveness as well as reaffirm the agencies’ commitment to safety and security.",
            "The IMSR is a 442 MWt per Core-unit (IMSR400) small modular molten salt fuelled, graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactor. Terrestrial Energy has developed a two-unit configuration which can deliver 884 MWt/390 MWe. The design features a completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers and shutdown rods all mounted inside a single vessel – the IMSR Core-unit. The sealed Core-unit is replaced completely at the end of its useful service life (nominally seven years). This allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. The IMSR400 achieves the highest levels of inherent safety as it does not depend on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or their support systems such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with upset conditions.",
            "Terrestrial says it operates at the high temperature required for broad industrial relevance with transformative economic potential. “The IMSR plant is capable of grid-based electric power generation and industrial cogeneration in many energy-intensive industries, including petrochemical and chemical synthesis for hydrogen and ammonia production.” Its use of existing industrial materials, components, and fuels supports its near-term deployment, setting the stage for a rapid global decarbonization of the primary energy system.",
            "The IMSR plant is designed to use standard assay Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) civilian nuclear fuel, enriched to less than 5% avoiding the need for High Assay LEU (HALEU) fuel. This assures a stable supply of fuel essential for a fleet of IMSR plant planned for operation in the 2030s and increases the IMSR’s international regulatory acceptance. Terrestrial Energy is advancing its fuel supply programme with Springfields Fuel (Westinghouse) in the UK and Orano in France.",

            "The work was performed under a contract within Phase 2 of the Advanced Modular Reactor (AMR) programme partially funded by the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which was awarded to Westinghouse with Ansaldo Nucleare as the main supplier. Under this contract, Ansaldo Nucleare led the design, purchase, installation and commissioning of two experimental facilities to support Westinghouse's lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR) technology. The Versatile Loop Facility (VLF) and the Passive Heat Removal Facility (PHRF) will collect experimental data supporting accelerated development of LFR technology.",
            "The £10m ($12.5m) UK government investment will enable Westinghouse to test the feasibility of key LFR’s materials, systems and components. The VLF will test a fuel pin bundle simulator, a compact heat exchanger and a coolant pump, resembling those that will be installed in the reactor coolant system. The PHRF will characterise the passive decay heat removal system of the Westinghouse LFR, producing experimental data for the qualification of computer codes devoted to performance assessment.",
            "Ansaldo Nucleare CEO Riccardo Casale noted: “Together with the UK subsidiary Ansaldo Nuclear Ltd, Ansaldo Nucleare remains at the forefront of Westinghouse Lead Fast Reactor development: a fruitful collaboration we can only be proud of.” Mark Urso, interim Chief Technology Officer of Westinghouse said: “Moving into the testing phase utilising these large-scale test facilities clearly demonstrates the maturity of the reactor development project that Westinghouse and Ansaldo Nucleare are advancing.” He added: “Our project goes beyond design and modelling activities, and includes hands-on activities contributing to enhancing our practical knowledge of LFR technology.”",
            "This is part of the wider initiative launched by a cooperation agreement signed by Westinghouse and Ansaldo Nucleare in October 2022 for the joint development of Generation IV LFR technology globally, and with near-term emphasis in key European countries such as UK, Romania and Belgium. The two companies agreed to",

It is a medium-output, modular construction plant harnessing a lead-cooled, fast spectrum core operating at high temperatures in a pool configuration reactor. Westinghouse says the simplicity of its safety systems, high-efficiency advanced ultra-supercritical water balance of plant, compact reactor building, absence of high-pressure containment, streamlined modular construction, and integrated non-reactor-based load following capability results in unparalleled economic potential”. IAEA lists it as being in the conceptual design stage.",

            "FKI’s “Korea-US Nuclear Power Civilian Cooperation Plan” was written by Park Sang-gil, an expert at law firm Gwangjang. It notes that a total of 34 export NPPs were under construction in 13 countries in 2022. Of these, 23 (67.6%) were ordered from Russia. China won orders for four plants, accounting for 11.7% of the total.",
            "The report said that, after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, leading NPP exporters such as South Korea, Japan, and Germany adopted nuclear phase-out policies, allowing Russia and China to become new powerhouses in the global nuclear power plant export market.",
            "The US sees this as a serious security threat and is preparing a strategy to restore competitiveness in the nuclear power industry by proposing related legislation, according to the report . In particular, small modular reactors (SMRs) are seen as the key to restoring competitiveness in the nuclear power industry. In 2022, the US launched its FIRST programme to support the initial foundation for the introduction of SMRs in countries seeking to build new NPPs. The Foundational Infrastructure for Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (FIRST) programme is led by the US Department of State",
            "The report noted that South Korea should consider developing a programme based on its competitiveness in NPP construction and operation as a complement to the FIRST programme. The South Korean government formalised its support for FIRST at the US-South Korea summit in May 2022. The following October, Japan developed its Winning an Edge Through Cooperation in Advanced Nuclear (WECAN) programme as part of FIRST and launched a feasibility study on the introduction of SMRs in Ghana jointly with the US.",
            "The report stresses the need to secure a stable supply of high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) used as a fuel for SMRs. South Korea is completely dependent on Russian company Tenex for HALEU. South Korea should therefore participate in the construction of HALEU enrichment facilities in the US through equity investment or engineering, procurement & construction (EPC) and also build a nuclear supply chain with the US, the report said.",
            "\"The recent US-Korea summit has opened the door for cooperation,” said said head of FKI's economic & industrial division, Chu Kwang-ho. “As the US aims to reclaim its position as the next nuclear superpower by focusing on Small Modular Reactors, it's crucial that Korea develop an action plan that takes advantage of the alliance.”",

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company has submitted its pre-application Regulatory Engagement Plan with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for its recently launched AP300 small modular reactor (SMR). Westinghouse claims it is the only SMR “truly based on an Nth-of-a-kind operating plant” and describes it as a “game-changer”. The 300 MWe single-loop pressurised water reactor is a scaled-down version of its AP1000.",
            "It will utilise identical AP1000 technology, to include major equipment, structural components, passive safety, proven fuel, and I&C systems. Westinghouse says the AP300 “will bring to bear a mature supply chain, constructability lessons learned, fast load-follow capabilities and proven O&M procedures and best practices from 18 reactor years of safe AP1000 operations.”",
            "The advanced passive safety system “automatically achieves safe shutdown without operator action and eliminates the need for backup power and cooling supply”. This also directly translates into a simplified design, lower CAPEX and smaller footprint. Like the AP1000, the AP300 is designed to operate for an 80+ year life cycle.",
            "Westinghouse notes that the Gen III+ technology has regulatory approval in the US, the UK and China, as well as compliance with European Utility Requirements (EUR) standards for NPPs. “Design certification is anticipated by 2027, followed by site specific licensing and construction on the first unit toward the end of the decade.”",
            "Westinghouse President & CEO Patrick Fragman said it is “the only SMR offering available that is based on deployed, operating and advanced reactor technology”. He added: \"It is using the DNA of the AP1000 in terms of technology.\" It “has unique advantages in terms of robustness of the safety case, simplicity of the design, with huge implications in terms of costs and time to construct and obviously an ease of deployment because, with the AP1000 being already deployed, the AP300 SMR will leverage the existing supply chain, the existing design, the existing licensing pedigree\". Fragman described it as “no more and no less than an AP1000 with one loop instead of two loops”. This means it is reusing a majority of components, systems, equipment. “The fuel is identical, the constructability lessons are identical,\" he said.",
            "Dr Rita Baranwal, currently Westinghouse Chief Technology Officer, has been named as Senior Vice President in the Energy Systems business unit and will lead the team developing the AP300 SMR. Baranwal is a former Assistant Secretary of Nuclear Energy at the US Department of Energy and was director of the Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear (GAIN) initiative at Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "Currently, the AP1000 is not licensed or operating anywhere in Europe. In the USA, two AP1000 reactors are under construction at the Vogle NPP (units 3&4) in Georgia. Unit 3 was finally connected to the grid in April and unit 4 is nearing completion. However, both are significantly delayed and overbudget. When construction began in 2009 they were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017. Cost has more than doubled.",
            "Two Westinghouse AP1000 units are in operation at each of China’s Sanmen and Haiyang NPPs after some delays and two CAP1000 units, the Chinese version of the AP1000, are being built as the second phase at each station. The proposed construction of four CAP1000 reactors (units 1-4) at China’s Lufeng NPP was approved by the National Development & Reform Commission but has not yet received State Council approval. Plans to build further AP1000 units in China, however, have been dropped in favour of Chinese Hualong-One units.",
            "Westinghouse has, meanwhile, been lobbying hard in former Eastern European countries. As a result, AP1000 units have recently been selected in Poland and are being considered by Bulgaria, while nine others are planned in Ukraine.",
            "As to SMRs, the AP300 may face stiff competition. The International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is also planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",

            "China’s Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research & Design Institute (SNERDI) says the largest and heaviest module has been installed at unit 4 of the Sanmen NPP in Zhejiang province. The CA20 module is 20.5 metres long, 14.1 metres wide and 20.9 metres high. It comprises plant and equipment for used fuel storage, transmission, the heat exchanger and waste collection, among other things. The total weight of the hoisting was 1024 tonnes, and installation was carried out using a 2600-tonne crawler crane. More than 1376 cubic metres of concrete will now be poured to fill the walls of the module.",
            "China’s State Council approved construction of two new units at each of the Sanmen NPP (3&4), Haiyang NPP (3&4) and Lufeng NPP (5&6) in 2021. The approvals were for Sanmen units 3&4, Haiyang 3&4 and units 5&6 of the Lufeng plant. Sanmen 1&2 and Haiyang 1&2 (Phase I) are Westinghouse AP1000 units. CNNC signed contracts for the civil construction of the nuclear islands and installation engineering for phase II at Sanmen and Haiyang in April 2022. China Nuclear Industry 22 Construction Company was contracted for the Sanmen Phase II nuclear island, and China Nuclear Industry 24 Construction Company for the Haiyang Phase II nuclear island. China Nuclear Industry Fifth Construction Company (CNI5) will undertake the nuclear island installation work at all four units.",
            "First concrete for Sanmen 3 was poured in June 2022 and for Sanmen 4 in March 2023.",
            "The CAP1000 reactor is China’s version of the AP1000. It uses modular construction techniques, enabling large structural modules to be built at factories and then installed at the site. \"Compared with the CA20 module of unit 3 (installed in August 2022), the installation components of the unit 4 CA20 module were optimised during the assembly stage,\" SNERDI said. \"Without affecting installation of the main body, the installation of some bulk items such as OLP panels, penetrations, steel bars and pipes was completed ahead of schedule.\" This paves the way for installation of the unit 4 nuclear island.",

            "Indústrias Nucleares do Brasil (INB) has signed four contracts and two agreements during the opening of the Nuclear Trade & Technology Exchange (NT2E). The biennial nuclear sector business and technology fair, promoted by the Brazilian Association for the Development of Nuclear Activities (ABDAN) is the biggest nuclear event in Latin America. It attracted many leading companies such as as Framatome, Rosatom, Westinghouse, Holtec, ENBPar, Eletronuclear, Amazul, Andrade Gutierrez, Nuclep, BNDES and Sebrae.",
            "INB signed three contracts with Westinghouse. Under one, Westinghouse will hire INB to supply specialised labour for handling fuel in the USA. Under the other two, INB contracted Westinghouse for the supply of metallic components and gadolinium rods for Angra 1 reloads and for development of a project for the component “protective grade” for fuel elements.",
            "INB also signed two agreements with Brazil’s Institute for Energy & Nuclear Research (IPEN) for a research partnership, and development of studies and technologies related to the production of fuel elements.",
            "A contract was also signed with Rosatom/Tenex, for the supply of natural UF6 (uranium hexafluoride). It follows a tender won last year for the supply of 330 tonnes of UF6 to Brazil. Rosatom Deputy Director General Kirill Komarov said: \"We continue to develop cooperation with the Brazilian company INB on the supply of uranium products. Last year, we won an international tender and signed a contract for the supply of uranium enrichment services. Another contract for the supply of natural uranium was signed in Rio de Janeiro today. \"",
            "During the opening of the event, ABDAN President Celso Cunha, stated that Brazil has an important mission: to convince the government that the country can become one of the world's biggest players in the nuclear sector. Brazil has the sixth largest uranium reserve in the world, already produces nuclear fuel and has the capacity to expand this production, he said.",
            "Cunha pointed out that under its 10-year energy plan, Brazil envisages the construction of a new 1,000 MWe NPP in addition to the completion of unit 3 at the Angra NPP. He added that nuclear technology also plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially in the fight against cancer. highlighted the relevance of this technology for public health and the advancement of medicine in Brazil.",
            "Kirill Komarov pointed out the role of state support for nuclear projects: “There are several world leaders in the construction of nuclear power plants including China, India, Russia and some countries of the Arab world. The governments of all these countries provide considerable support to nuclear projects while also directly participating in their implementation. Nuclear energy development is certainly impossible without government support.”",

            "Brazil’s nuclear utility Eletronuclear said in a statement that it is committed to reversing the suspension of work at unit 3 of the Angra NPP. It is seeking a constructive dialogue with the city of Angra dos Reis to clarify the issues and to find a solution that allows the resumption of construction at the site. Eletronuclear stressed the importance of the project for Brazil emphasising that the stoppage of work has wider consequences affecting the economy and the well-being of the local population. Eletronuclear therefore wants to resume construction of the unit as soon as possible, in view of the benefits its completion will bring to the region.",
            "Eletronuclear said it was seeking a \"constructive dialogue\" with the municipal government after it was ordered to stop work on Angra 3 on 19 April. Construction of the unit had finally restarted in November 2022 only resumed in November after a seven-year freeze.",
            "In April, Mayor Fernando Jordão said he authorised the embargo “because Eletronuclear is executing a project that is not in accordance with what the municipality approved\". He added that Eletronuclear had not yet paid the \"socio-environmental compensation\" it had agreed in 2009, totalling BRL264m ($52m). He noted: \"We have to resolve this issue so that we can issue the construction permit for Angra 3.”",
            "President of the Municipal Environment Institute Mário Reis also said Eletronuclear had “increased the circulation area in one of the units, changing the project. He added: “The process is being analysed and a new permit will be issued when the modifications are approved\".",
            "Currently, Brazil has two nuclear units in operation at Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde, in Rio de Janeiro. Angra 1&2, a total of 1.9GWe, generate 1.1% of the energy of the Brazilian Interconnected System. Angra 1, a 609 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactors (PWR), began operation in 1982 following long delays. Unit 2, a 1,275MWe PWR supplied by German Kraftwerk Union, began operation in 2000, again after long delays. Eletrobrás has been working with Westinghouse to extend the operating lifetime of Angra 1 from 40 to 60 years.",
            "Construction of Angra 3, a Siemens/KWU 1,405 MWe PWR began in 1984 but was ceased two years later. Work resumed in 2006, but was suspended a number of times for financial and political reasons. It was stopped again in 2015 when it was 65% complete. Preparation for the restart of concreting began in February 2022 with the signing of a contract between Eletronuclear and the AGIs consortium, comprising Ferreira Guedes, Matricial and ADtranz. This included the assembly of a concrete plant on site in September, and numerous field and laboratory tests. Concreting began in November with a ceremony marking resumption of civil works at the plant, which was then expected to be ready in 2028.",
            "Following Eletronuclear’s statement, the Minister of Mines & Energy, Alexandre Silveira, confirmed that the completion of works on the Angra 3 is a government priority. During a hearing at the Mines & Energy Commission in the Chamber of Deputies, the Secretary for Electric Energy, Gentil Nogueira de Sá Junior, presented an overview of the project. He said the work is budgeted at BRL27.8bn, of which BRL 7.8bn has already been invested. He said the amount of investment still needed (BRL 20bn) is being analysed by the National Bank for Economic & Social Development (BNDES). \"A whole model is being built by the bank, because this plant will have constant generation, and we have to reach a balance between energy security and reasonable tariffs\", he noted. The cost of abandoning the project is put at BRL13.6bn",
            "The initial schedule indicates that the project can be concluded in 2029. The Ministry of Mines & Energy (MME) said the aim is to save water in hydroelectric reservoirs when there is little rain. However, estimates indicate that the energy cost of Angra 3 would be high, around BRL720 per MWh in the first 16 years, subsequently falling to BRL240. When hydroelectric reservoirs are full, energy on the market costs BRL55.",
            "MME said it is evaluating the investment because nuclear energy is an alternative within the energy transition, since it does not generate greenhouse gas emissions. There are additional benefits, such as job and income generation around the project, as well as mineral extraction to support it. Silveira said the government is discussing completion of Angra 3 noting that BNDES is co-ordinating the process, with the expectation that funds will be obtained by September 2024.",

This marks a significant step towards operations said Georgia Power “Unit 4 is projected to enter service in late fourth quarter 2023 or the first quarter 2024.”",
            "Kim Greene, Chairman, President & CEO of Georgia Power, said enthusiasm at the Vogtle site is high “with unit 3 in the final stages of start-up testing and unit 4 making progress towards safely loading fuel”. She added: \"The team at unit 4 has been able to take lessons learned and best practices from unit 3 and apply them. That has allowed us to safely complete hot functional testing on unit 4 in a significantly shorter time frame than we did for unit 3. It's incredible that these new units will provide our state with zero-emissions energy for the next 60 to 80 years.”",
            "During hot functional testing, plant systems achieved normal operating pressure and temperature, without nuclear fuel in the reactor, to demonstrate the systems will operate on an integrated basis as designed. Now, the site team will complete the remaining work necessary to submit documentation to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This will show that all inspection, tests and analyses have been performed and all acceptance criteria, collectively known as ITAACS, have been met for Vogtle 4 as required by Southern Nuclear’s Combined Operating Licence. Each ITAAC closure notice must be verified before fuel can be loaded into the reactor.",

            "Korea has called on the USA to co-operate in resolving the legal dispute between Korea's Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Westinghouse over Korea’s planned reactor exports to the Czech Republic and other nations. Industry Ministry Lee Chang-yang made the request during a meeting with his US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in Washington on the sidelines of President Yoon Suk Yeol's state visit, according to Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy.",
            "In October 2022, Westinghouse Electric Company filed a lawsuit against KHNP after Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) and listed Polish private power plant operator ZE PAK announced plans to sign a letter of intent with KHNP on building an APR1400 reactor at a former coal plant. This followed a tender to supply reactors for Poland’s nuclear power programme, which had been awarded to Westinghouse, despite press reports that KHNP’s offer had been expected to win. The Westinghouse lawsuit alleges intellectual property infringement by KHNP insisting that US government consent is needed before KHNP can export an APR1400 nuclear reactor as it is created based on Westinghouse technology.",
            "KHNP contests this. “After launching its own nuclear programme, Korea gradually built up technology, carrying out research and development projects with long-term plans for over 30 years. Thanks to this process, it gained competence in the design, production and construction of nuclear power plants in order to finally develop her own, independent technology,” the company said.",
            "During the meeting with Granholm, Lee said: \"The South Korean and the US governments need to make joint efforts to swiftly resolve the legal dispute between the nuclear energy companies of the two nations, as the global dependence on nuclear energy has risen recently in the face of an energy supply crisis.\"",
            "Earlier this year, the US Department of Energy (DOE) rejected a filing by KHNP regarding its bid for a nuclear reactor construction project in the Czech Republic, according to officials. In a response to the KHNP's letter, DOE said that any such letters \"must be submitted by US persons\" under its regulations, indicating that its cooperation with Westinghouse is essential, raising concerns about Korea’s export plans.",
            "The joint statement, issued after the summit between Yoon and US President Joe Biden, said that the two nations mutually respect \"each other's export control regulations and intellectual property rights\" regarding nuclear energy issues.",
            "Despite this underlying issue, it was agreed to boost cooperation in the nuclear energy sector, including the manufacturing, operation and management of small modular reactors (SMRs) and their export, as well as a more resilient nuclear supply chain, the Ministry said. The two sides also agreed to launch the Energy Policy Dialogue to boost cooperation on the development of hydrogen, renewable and other clean energy, and to jointly cooperate on energy security to achieve their net-zero goals.",
            "Lee stressed the need for stronger ties regarding supply chains of key minerals by maximising the US-led Mineral Security Partnership, and asked for Washington's attention to South Korean energy companies operating in the US as they seek tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Ministry added.",
            "Lee’s request to Granholm came after a press conference held in Poland by Westinghouse CEO Patrick Fragman following talks with US Ambassador to Poland Marek Brzeziński and Minister of Development Waldemar Buda. Fragman was accompanied by the Westinghouse President in Poland Mirosław Kowalik.",
            "In reply to a question from Polish journalists Jacek Perzyński from Biznesalert about Korea’s planned nuclear projects in Poland, Fragman replied that the Korean project was “virtual”. He added: “We do not believe that it is a credible project. It violates US export laws and international regulations. In our opinion, this project will never be realised. We have the same stance on Korean initiatives in other countries…. The potential for Poland exists, but you have to wait for it. In the short term, if you want a proven technology that is already in use and provides attractive energy costs, the AP1000 is an obvious choice.\"",
            "Daniel Czyżewski from Energetika 24 then asked: \"Please clarify, the KHNP nuclear power plant in Poland will never be built?…. I wanted to be more precise, because this is a strong position.\" Fragman responded: \"I cannot imagine that a country like Poland, which applies the rule of law, would allow technology that violates intellectual property rights.\" Czyżewski persisted: \"You don't see any possibility of an agreement with the Koreans?\" Fragman replied: \"I just told you we're in the middle of a lawsuit, which doesn't leave much room for negotiation. Litigation means that we have reached the point where negotiations have not yielded anything, the methods of reaching an agreement have been exhausted. A lawsuit is a last resort.\"",
            "According to Czyżewski Westinghouse officials then “tried to push an ‘authorised’ version of the statement, which was milder than what was actually said.” However, the entire exchange was recorded and the recording was later published on Twitter by Energetica 24.",
            "In a long follow-up article, Czyżewski speculated about the reasons for Fragman’s statement, noting that Fragman “knew perfectly well” that the meeting was being recorded. He suggested if reflected a struggle behind the scenes noting “there are billions of dollars in the game”.",
            "He said: “We do not know what the judgments of the courts in the United States and Korea will be, but there are other forms of pressure. It is no secret that the Polish government chose WEC [Westinghouse] mainly for political reasons, so it cannot be ruled out that the company will try to sink the Korean project through these channels as well.” He also noted that it is “likely” that the Koreans will make some components for the /Westinghouse NPP as “Westinghouse is a relatively small company that will not be able to carry out the investment from A to Z”…. It is possible that Fragman simply wants to strengthen his negotiating position” so that Korea will lower the price for its services.",
            "Czyżewski said “sources” had told Energetika 24 that Fragman's statement may also be a form of pressure on the Polish government.",
            "Recalling Fragman’s charge that the Koreas are breaking US law, he noted that it does not apply in Poland, “so it has no legislative significance for Warsaw” but “American political pressure may still matter”.",
            "However, the talks underway in Washington could resolve the situation, he suggested. “For Korea, the nuclear programme is crucial and relations with the US are very good. South Korean President Yook Sun Yeol is currently in the United States, where he was warmly welcomed by Joe Biden. It is likely that the leaders will coordinate nuclear dissension between the companies” given wider geopolitical considerations. “Washington agreed to the periodic deployment of US nuclear-armed submarines in South Korea and the inclusion of Seoul in nuclear planning operations. In return, South Korea pledged not to develop its own nuclear weapons.”",
            "He concluded: “It seems, therefore, that Patrick Fragman's ploy is part of the negotiations. With whom and about what? We do not know this for sure, but it may well be addressed to both KHNP and the Polish government. Ultimately, who doesn't like to kill two birds with one stone.”",
            "The Polish government has, from the start made clear its support for both the official nuclear programme based on Westinghouse technology and the Korean project supported by private companies Poland’s PGE, ZE PAK (both of which are owned by the Treasury). Fragman said that having two nuclear technologies in Poland \"makes no sense\". He added: “If you ask any person with any knowledge of industrial processes, there is no point in having two separate technologies for these two locations. In the context of synergy, supply chain, capacity engagement, staff training, it only makes sense to choose one technology.\"",
            "Energetika 24 said PGE, ZE PAK and the Ministry of State Assets, did not immediately comment on Fragman’s remarks. However, KHNP did respond. \"The statements that indicate that KHNP has infringed Westinghouse's intellectual property rights and cannot export its own nuclear technology to Poland without Westinghouse's prior consent are incorrect. There are no obstacles to KHNP's implementation of the nuclear power plant project in Poland,\" KHNP told Energetika 24.",

In September 2020, plant owner Shandong Nuclear Power Company, a subsidiary of the State Energy Investment Corporation (SPIC), in cooperation with the local company Fengyuan Thermal Power, began trial operation of the entire heating network using steam from the two AP1000 reactors and in the following November the system went into commercial operation. The system takes non-radioactive steam from the secondary circuit of Haiyang 1&2. This is first fed to a heat exchange station on site and then to an off-site heat exchange station owned by Fengyuan Thermal Power, which distributes heated water through city heating pipes to consumers.",

Little Schweiz AG, tells",
            "There are also spill over effects, especially across the second and third tier suppliers of specialised components and equipment that they are delivering into the supply chain. “The reason is that when there is not a repetitive business, then the capabilities of companies will shrink and diminish,” says Kruse. However, while the industry – bar a few hotspots here and there – has largely been in a position of managed decline for decades that landscape has radically changed in the last few years and supply chain challenges must now be addressed if the sector is to meet new and reinvigorated market demands.",
            "“There is no global answer to address all these challenges and businesses need to think on a more regional perspective,” says Kruse, adding: “It is a significant issue in Western Europe, as well as to an increasing extent in Eastern Europe, especially at those plants that are operating Russian technology, because this will also lead to increasing supply chain issues due to the geopolitical situation. The most severe supply chain issues are related to Europe and possibly countries that are closely tied to European technology, like South Africa. Conversely, in countries like the US, China and Japan there is a strong and large nuclear fleet and a domestic market in general.",
            "Supply chains don’t just concern physical components though. Another critical element for the nuclear sector concerns the skilled and experienced people that are needed for development to take place. While there are regional variations at play, the recruitment and human capital development issue is significantly more widespread. This is currently a big issue in the UAE and Turkey, for example, as well as Saudi Arabia, which plans to start building soon.",
            "“I think this is a general issue in most countries, excluding China, Russia and also countries like India which are all special cases. But in regard to Western countries, the ageing of staff at the operator end, as well as at the supplier end, creates a significant challenge. Entities are struggling with these capabilities due to ageing and lack of young professionals entering the industry. Losing experienced workforce also means they are losing the capabilities needed to oversee the product that’s going to be produced, permitted, and then installed in the plant. One of the key issues is that 80% of the effort is documentation-related and companies need to understand how to do the technical documentation, the licensing and permitting-related documentation for equipment and components,” Kruse explains. He adds: It’s a linked process. You cannot isolate the operator side from the supplier side because the operator has an oversight responsibility. It also needs to their contribution to the supply chain, in regard to requirements management, configuration, documentation, licensing and quality assurance. This is a significant challenge in many countries right now, “not speaking about the challenges with certified craftsmen like welders and radiation protection labour”, Kruse adds.",
            "It’s clear that in order to overcome this issue requires education programmes and also effective marketing to make the industry more attractive as an employment opportunity due to the energy transition. Developments like SMR and fusion do have an air of excitement that might go some way to making the nuclear sector more attractive to the young, brilliant engineers needed but there is stiff competition. “There is loss of people, especially the younger workforce from the oil and gas sector or the nuclear sector into the renewable sector. It’s technicians but also the academic workforce working elsewhere and that creates workforce challenges,” Kruse says.",
            "Digital tooling to support management and training as part of a knowledge transfer programme is emerging as part of the solution, but Kruse argues that it is not a complete answer. “People are pinning their hopes on digital tools that are emerging like building information modelling and configuration management tools which link into the requirements management. However, in the end there are always three dimensions that need to be considered in a supply chain. You have the human element, you have the technology element, and you have the organisation element. That cannot all be solved just by digital tools. Interfaces need to be managed, they need to be human and need to take decisions. Nuclear oversight needs to be done by someone and both the operator and the supplier need to have these capabilities. That will always require humans so they cannot be fully replaced,” he says.",
            "Nonetheless, digital tools can make some supply chain issues easier, such as engineering of components, ageing management of operating plants and exchanging g requirements between regulators, owners, and suppliers. “This is a big issue, ensuring the equipment is being manufactured and installed in a conformant way and doesn’t create any non-conformities, which lead to cost overruns and risk energy availability of the plant,” notes Kruse.",
            "Developing a suitable regulatory regime",
            "Another related supply chain challenge is the licensing and regulatory processes that are in place. Kruse cites SMRs as an example: “One of the main barriers to SMR development is international standards determination with regard to licensing and product standardisation. SMRs require a standard supply chain, which leads to economies of scale and learning curve effects that will bring down the cost. That is needed to make the levelised cost of energy competitive against renewables and this is only possible if the licensing of SMRs is similar to aviation, for example. When you license an aircraft in the US, by the US authorities, it’s also accepted by the European authorities. For nuclear, that is not the case. It’s country-specific licensing and though there are a lot of efforts underway to make that process more harmonised it’s not really progressing satisfactorily.”",
            "Kruse continues: “This will also affect the supply chain because economically viable SMRs require a standardised global supply chain. Today, nuclear new build often demands a significant local component. Countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Turkey mandate local content for example, and that means modification of an open supply chain which requires that the local workforce are appropriately educated and all the manufacturing is certified.”",
            "Considering other aspects of new build, another key supply chain issue is the loss of capability as the industry has fragmented. Suppliers from Western countries in particular do not have a strong integrated EPC capability like they used to when they were building multiple second generation plants.",
            "Kruse argues that companies like Framatome, Westinghouse and Siemens had far stronger vertically integrated supply chains and could therefore manage the end-to-end supply chain in-house. “This capability doesn’t exist anymore among Western suppliers,” says Kruse. Conversely, Eastern suppliers, for example Rosatom, have a backwards vertically-integrated capability. “Their supply chain is capable of delivering locally but, irrespective from sanctions, is actually hardly able to deliver globally. This is because the local standards are often different from Western standards and then they need to either replace sub-suppliers, or they are internal sub suppliers and need to manufacture according to Western standards, like ASME and IEEE that they are not used to. Again, that’s strongly related to documentation requirements. If you link it also to the labour issue in Western countries then if the owner organisation is short of capable people, then they cannot manage the supplier and the supply chain sufficiently to avoid cost overruns and redundant work and reengineering efforts,” Kruse concludes.",
            "Light at the end of the tunnel?",
            "Improving the capabilities of the supply chain is a complex and multi-faceted challenge but Kruse believes there are positive actions that can be taken. He says: “I think one main requirement is to continue working on international harmonisation and standardisation of licensing and permitting. That’s one key element. Secondly, I think that some existing plants need to get",
            "the ‘as built’ documentation, as well as the modification documentation in place and digitised so they have a proper component inventory and the needed master data for every component available. That will allow them to become more independent and knowledgeable about what they have really built into the plant as components.”",
            "Kruse says that new plants tend to already have this kind of information available in a digital format as regulators nowadays have quite strict configuration management requirements asking the owner and the supplier to have a digital model of the plant, including all digital information available on the installed equipment and components. Older plants don’t all have that and there are even still a significant number of components which are not properly documented. “Often only the supplier who has been servicing the plant has the knowledge about that and this means that there is a risk for the operator by not having sufficient intelligence if the supplier is not available anymore, or if they want to have a dual source strategy,” explains Kruse, adding: “That technical database is a prerequisite to build a more robust supply chain, to understand where operators do have obsolescence of materials, or where materials and suppliers are at risk. That kind of classification is the groundwork that is needed.”",
            "This information needs to be available to operators to build a resilient supply chain if alternative suppliers are to be sourced and are to be able to meet the replacement requirements for those components. “In Western Europe many operators have not done this homework yet and I would also suppose this is the case in the US even though the US has a larger fleet. Where those vulnerabilities exist, the risks to component supply chains are necessarily higher whereas in a bigger, more robust market that’s less likely to happen, although not impossible,” notes Kruse.",
            "In Western Europe, many operators are concerned about the capability of the supply chain and suppliers of critical components leaving the market, or losing the required capabilities that means they can deliver on time, at the right cost and quality. That puts the economics of the plant at risk.",
            "The nuclear supply chain is also complex. There is the supply chain for new build, then for operations and another for decommissioning. There are international and quite local components in that supply chain. “There’s market design, policy and all sorts of other things that go into that but if you can’t build and maintain it at a reasonable cost, you’re nowhere. The common denominator is the question of technical and licensing and safety-related standards and the availability of knowledgeable people who can deal with the requirements engineering well,” says Kruse. He concludes: “The levelised cost of energy needs to be competitive against renewables that only have a very low marginal cost. This is the biggest challenge for nuclear power plants and the supply chain has to play a quite important role to deliver that promise of safe and cheap energy. There is simply no one gold bullet to fix it.”"

            "Urenco has agreed to supply enrichment services to the Kozloduy NPP in Bulgaria. Urenco has become part of a supply chain which includes fuel partners Canada’s Cameco, UK-based Uranium Asset Management (UAM) and US-based Westinghouse. Cameco has signed a 10-year supply contract with Westinghouse to provide sufficient volumes of natural uranium hexafluoride (UF6 – including uranium and conversion services), to support unit 5 at Kozloduy. Urenco’s enrichment facilities in Europe (the UK, the Netherlands and Germany) will use the UF6 from Cameco to supply enriched uranium product (EUP) for fabrication into nuclear fuel rods by Westinghouse. The EUP will be delivered to Westinghouse’s facility at Vasteras in Sweden, which will fabricate fuel for Kozloduy.",
            "Kozloduy NPP on the Danube River currently uses fuel supplied by Rosatom’s Tvel for its two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Units 1-4 with VVER-440 reactors were closed as a condition for Bulgaria’s accession to the EU, despite being extensively upgraded, drastically reducing Bulgaria’s energy export. Under ppressure from the EU, Bulgaria is now seeking to diversify its fuel supplies away from Russia. Earlier this year. Kozloduy NPP signed a 10-year agreement with France’s Framatome to supply nuclear fuel to Kozloduy's unit 5 from early 2025. Kozloduy had previously signed a similar contract with Westinghouse Electric Sweden for nuclear fuel for unit 6 from 2024. Bulgaria's current contract with Tvel expires in at the end of 2025.",
            "Urenco CEO Boris Schucht, along with representatives from Cameco, UAM and Westinghouse, visited Sofia to mark the new agreement and the first order from Kozloduy. Boris said, “Urenco is ready to support countries seeking to increase their energy security and independence and I am pleased to welcome Kozloduy as our newest customer.",
            "“This is Cameco’s first agreement to supply fuel for Bulgaria’s nuclear energy sector,” said Cameco’s President & CEO Tim Gitzel. “We are very pleased to add another market to Cameco’s global commercial portfolio and to expand our contributions to countries like Bulgaria that are seeking to enhance their energy security while affirming their commitment to carbon-free nuclear power in achieving their climate goals.”",

        "text": [
            "The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy (DOE) sent to Rosatom, CNN reported. The letter, from the director of DOE’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, was dated 17 March 2023. It tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government”.",
            "Since Russia took control of ZNPP in March 2022, the Russian national guard has been protecting the station and in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally transferring ZNPP to Russian jurisdiction under nuclear utility Rosenergoatom (part of Rosatom). A Russian Federal State Unitary Enterprise. Zaporizhia NPP was established by Rosenergoatom to operate the plant. ZNPP has been subjected to repeated shelling and drone attacks as well as several major military operations by Ukrainian forces to take back control of the facility.",
            "The DOE letter says: “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorised persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities, such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and wilfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorise others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorised recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.”",
            "It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. She added: “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorising the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”",
            "Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated 24 October 24 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use ZNPP and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorisation to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity”. DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.",
            "US technologies at ZNPP largely concern Westinghouse-supplied nuclear fuel, a used fuel dry storage facility built by Holtec and software related to operation of the six units, none of which is of any interest to Rosatom, according to the large number of Russian scientists and nuclear experts who commented on the DOE letter.",
            "All of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are based on Soviet and Russian technology and its NPPs originally depended on nuclear fuel supplied by TVEL, which was taken back to Russia for reprocessing. However, nuclear utility Energoatom, encouraged by the US, began a fuel diversification policy and began implementing the Ukraine Nuclear Fuel Qualification Project (UNFQP) for VVER-1000 fuel. The Project assumed the use of Western-manufactured fuel in VVER-1000 reactors with Westinghouse selected as vendor.",
            "In 2005, South Ukraine's third unit was the country's first to use the six lead test assemblies supplied by Westinghouse placed into the reactor core together with Russian fuel for a period of pilot operation. A reload batch of 42 fuel assemblies was provided by Westinghouse in mid-2009 for a three-year period. Under a 2008 contract, Westinghouse supplied a total of 630 fuel assemblies for South Ukraine 2&3. However, the fuel caused serious damage to one of the reactors and in 2010 Energoatom signed a long-term fuel supply contract with TVEL for all 15 reactors. Westinghouse fuel had earlier also caused problems at the Loviisa NPP in Finland and the Temelin NPP in the Czech Republic.",
            "Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia, in 2014, Ukraine again turned to the US and extended its 2008 contract with Westinghouse for fuel supply to 2020. In 2015 Energoatom ordered Westinghouse fuel for ZNPP unit 5 as well as for South Ukraine. Despite continued warnings from Russia about the safety of the Westinghouse fuel, by 2021, six of Ukraine's 15 reactors were using it: South Ukraine 2&3 and four units at ZNPP. Because Westinghouse, unlike TVEL, does not take back the used fuel, Ukraine contracted US Holtec to build a a long-term dry storage facility for used fuel at ZNPP, which has operated since 2001.",
            "Commenting on the DOE letter, there is a general consensus among Russian experts that there are really no critical US technologies at ZNPP that are of any use to Rosatom. According to nuclear energy expert Alexey Anpilogov, President of the Foundation for Support of Scientific Research and Development of Civil Initiatives Research: \"There are two main points that distinguished the four Ukrainian NPPs from the Russian ones, they are the Westinghouse alternative nuclear fuel (TVS-W) and the dry storage of used raw materials, which was built by Holtec in Energodar. Everything else works on Soviet technologies.”",
            "He added that, when the US began adapting Ukrainian NPPs to enable their use of Westinghouse fuel in 2008 nuclear fuel, Rosatom withdrew its guarantees for those plant. The decision was not political, he explains, noting that the use of US fuel assemblies in Soviet reactors at the Finnish Loviisa NPP had revealed the shortcomings and that their use in Ukraine confirmed those concerns. “After the arrival of Westinghouse, Ukraine operated ZNPP at its own risk. Practice has shown that TVS-W fuel is less reliable than Russian fuel elements, and it is questionable from an economic point of view,” he said.",
            "He noted that Westinghouse fuel for VVER reactors is not a 100% copy of TVEL’s fuel. “They have a certain share of their own experience. But by God, it would be better to have a full copy… everyone who tried to use Westinghouse assemblies encountered huge problems.” Citing the fuel deformations that occurred in Loviisa, Temelin and South Ukraine, he said: “So, whether the Americans want it or not, we will touch their fuel. Because there is no choice. These dangerous assemblies have to be removed from the plant.\"",
            "He noted that the fuel “operates with a longer cycle between refuellings, which is achieved with increased enrichment.” This also makes TVS-W more expensive than Russian fuel. He added that the need to build used fuel storage facilities at ZNPP had also increased costs. “Rosatom includes disposal in the cost of nuclear fuel supply. Working with the United States has increased Ukraine's costs and reduced the safety of its nuclear industry,\" Anpilogov concluded. “But the choice of American fuel, rather than Russian, was always dictated by political reasons,\" he asserted. \"The technologies that the Americans left behind at ZNPP have no sensitive significance for Rosatom. The station's equipment can be quickly returned to factory settings.\"",
            "Nuclear scientist Alexander Uvarov, Director of AtomInfo-Centre, confirmed that: “There are no secrets or special technologies at ZNPP, but there may be commercial secrets.\" This may relate to software, he explained. He said the US has been writing letters since last year saying that in accordance with agreements, this American software should not be touched. “It's just that CNN has only just noticed it. And, apparently, for a reason,” he said. “A number of countries are now pushing the European Union to impose the toughest possible sanctions against Rosatom and its subsidiaries,” he noted. .",
            "He said the supplied software is mainly engineering programs designed for the operation of specific power units of the plant. This includes RELAP simulation software and neutronics codes that have been adapted to the needs of Westinghouse. “And let's be honest: in most cases, RELAP is not even used by professionals anymore”. He explained that “These engineering programs are of no scientific or technical interest to us…. We have our own calculation complexes, and in a fairly large number. After all, the VVER-1000s at ZNPP are our reactors.” He added: “If I were a student, I would still look through their documentation out of curiosity, but no one will take it seriously. But to give this event more weight, CNN and called it ‘nuclear technical data of American origin’.",
            "Currently VNPP unit 1,3,4 & 5 use Westinghouse fuel and reserves will last for four years. However, it is planned to replace it completely with Russian fuel, Renat Karchaa, adviser to the Director of Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom Concern, told Interfax. \"Theoretically, the current reserves of American fuel are for about four years. But its replacement with the Russian fuel will begin much earlier. We don't need American fuel, nor do we need their technologies. We have our own regulations,” he said.",
            "Alexey Anpilogov told VZGLYAD newspaper that the DOE letter could be a pretext for imposing sanctions on Rosatom. \"Everyone understands perfectly well that the ZNPP will remain under Russian control, it is impossible to remove the power units and American technologies, so the United States is creating a media hype. Perhaps in the future, Washington will initiate lawsuits against Rosatom for allegedly disclosing secret technologies or lost profits.” He commented: “American companies have lost a lot of key positions in the nuclear production market and lost a number of tenders to Rosatom. Naturally, in most cases we are not talking about the European continent, where we are now banned, but about Africa and Asia.\"",
            "Maxim Shingarkin, ecologist and former Russian Duma member, said: “The Russian Federation can throw this [DOE] letter in the trash, and not inform anyone about what is happening at the nuclear facility, which is the property of the Russian Federation. We have to unload the dangerous fuel. If the Americans come and take it away along with the used nuclear fuel, it will be just fine. We will only welcome it if the Americans take home their dangerous materials.”"

CNSC found no fundamental barriers to licensing the small modular reactor design. The VDR is not a required part of the licensing process and is an optional service provided by the CNSC. It offers an assessment of a nuclear power plant design based on a vendor's reactor technology.",
            "“It is the first technology review completed by a major regulator of a nuclear plant design that uses a Generation IV reactor technology to supply heat at high temperature, and the first time for molten salt reactor technology,” said Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish. “This review is a major step to bring molten salt technology to commercial markets and IMSR plants to large industrial companies seeking practicable high-impact solutions to decarbonize industrial production.”",
            "The VDR involved a comprehensive review of the IMSR nuclear power plant covering 19 “focus areas” defined by CNSC and required Terrestrial Energy to prepare hundreds of technical submissions. Its scope included a systematic review of engineering management processes, confirmatory testing programme for IMSR components and systems, reactor controls and safety systems, defence-in-depth strategy, safety analysis, and the requirements for safeguards, security, fire protection and radiation protection. Following an extensive multi-year review, CNSC staff concluded that there are no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant.",
            "Terrestrial said the IMSR plant supplies high-quality heat (585 degrees C), which water-cooled reactor technology cannot. This increases the efficiency of electric power generation by nearly 50 percent and expands the use of nuclear energy to zero-carbon industrial cogeneration (heat and power) for the first time.",
            "The IMSR plant is designed to use standard assay Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) civilian nuclear fuel, enriched to less than 5 percent, thereby avoiding the need for High Assay LEU (HALEU) fuel. This assures a stable supply of fuel essential for a fleet of IMSR plants operating in the 2030s and increases the IMSR’s international regulatory acceptance. Terrestrial Energy is advancing its fuel supply programme with Springfields Fuel (Westinghouse) in the UK and Orano in France.",

            "\"The implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme is one of the greatest challenges Poland has faced in recent decades, both in terms of complexity and the competencies it demands,\" said Mateusz Berger, Government Plenipotentiary for Strategic Energy Infrastructure. \"The submission of an application for the decision-in-principle for the construction of the first nuclear power plant marks an important stage showing the maturity of the project implemented in Pomerania.”",
            "In November 2022, the government selected Westinghouse to supply the plant. PEJ and Westinghouse signed a Bridge Contract in February, covering ten main areas, including: development of a detailed delivery model; preparation of a security assessment and a quality programme; and, also, identification of potential suppliers with a focus on Polish companies. Westinghouse will prepare a list of requirements necessary for the execution of the investment, including adjusting the AP1000 technology to meet local regulations. The contract assumes the preparation of the principles of external financing for the project.",
            "Meanwhile, Poland's ZE PAK, Polska Grupa Energetyczna and Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power signed a letter of intent to cooperate on a NPP project in Patnow based on South Korean APR1400 reactors.",
            "The application by copper and silver producer KGHM Polska Miedź is for a SMR. KGHM said that, until completion of the administrative procedure, it will not provide information on the course of the proceedings or details of the application. KGHM said it is one of the largest Polish companies and at the same time one of the largest energy consumers in the country. “That is why our involvement in energy projects, among which the nuclear project is of primary importance, is obvious, said Tomasz Zdzikot, President of the KGHM Management Board. “This is a project which will guarantee the stability of our operations in the future.”",
            "In 2022, KGHM signed an agreement with US NuScale Power for preliminary work representing the first step in the process of implementing SMR technology within the business activities of the KGHM Group. The target is to deploying a first NuScale Voygr SMR power plant in Poland as early as 2029. KGHM is investigating possible sites.",
            "KGHM wants to explore the deployment of SMR technology to repurpose or replace existing coal-fired power plants and provide electricity and heat for its industrial processes. KGHM is also looking more generally to diversify its energy sources. By 2030, 50% of the electricity used by KGHM will come from its own sources, including renewables. The Sierra Gorda mine in Chile is already powered by 100% with renewable energy.",
            "In July 2022, KGHM submitted an application to Poland's National Atomic Energy Agency (NAEA) to evaluate NuScale's SMR technology and prepare a site study. Under a task order signed in September, NuScale will continue to support KGHM's application to the NAEA through activities including drafting additional preliminary safety analysis reports and coordinating with the NAEA. The task order also sets the stage for the subsequent tasks in the Early Works Agreement as proposed by NuScale. The VOYGR will have six modules, each with an installed capacity of 77 MWe. NuScale's SMR technology gained approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in August 2020."

            "Japan, the UK, Canada, the US and France have agreed to co-operate to reduce dependence on Russia as a supplier of nuclear materials and technology. Their statement was issued at the Nuclear Energy Forum being held in Japan’s Sapporo alongside the meeting of Group of Seven (G7) ministers on climate, energy and environment. It was published on the UK government website.",
            "The statement on civil nuclear fuel co-operation says the five countries “share common visions of democracy as well as safe and secure global economic and energy systems”. The war in Ukraine and the increasing impacts of climate change “have fundamentally altered the global energy landscape and accelerated the need for collaboration between like-minded allies”. Based on a 2022 declared intention by the G7 to reduce reliance on Russian nuclear supplies, the five",
            "Signatories of the statement have identified potential areas of collaboration to this end.",
            "These include collaboration “on nuclear fuels to support the stable supply of fuels for the operating reactor fleets of today, enable the development and deployment of fuels for the advanced reactors of tomorrow, and achieve reduced dependence on Russian supply chains”. This multilateral effort “would aim to recognise and leverage the unique resources and capabilities possessed by each country’s civil nuclear sectors to establish a global commercial nuclear fuel market”.",
            "The statement continues: “Collaborating on strategic opportunities in uranium extraction, conversion, enrichment, and fabrication supports our collective climate, energy security, and economic resilience objectives. This multilateral cooperation would enable us to strengthen our domestic sectors and establish a level playing field to compete more effectively against predatory suppliers.”",
            "The aim is “to increase the depth and resilience of our nuclear fuel supply chains, while supporting the wider geostrategic objectives of further reducing reliance on Russia in the nuclear fuel supply chain for the long term and increasing the availability of commercial free-market alternatives in the supply of civil nuclear technologies to third countries”. The supply of civil nuclear technology, equipment, or materials would be subject to applicable domestic laws, regulations, and international agreements.",
            "The five countries further seek to explore avenues “to collaborate in multilateral spheres to advance energy security and economic resilience for partners around the globe”.",
            "In a press release, UK Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps said the alliance between the UK, US, Canada, Japan and France “will leverage the respective resources and capabilities of each country’s civil nuclear power sectors to undermine Russia’s grip on supply chains”. The agreement will be used as the basis for pushing Russia out of the nuclear fuel market “entirely”, and “doing so as quickly as possible”.",
            "The agreement “will also strengthen our respective nuclear energy sectors, which is key to boosting our domestic energy security and bringing down electricity bills for British families”. Nuclear fuel is needed to operate NPPs that provide around 15% of the UK’s electricity supply with an aim for it to make up 25% by 2050.",
            "Shapps said the UK has been at the very heart of global efforts to support Ukraine and this is the next vital step, uniting with other countries “to show … that Russia isn’t welcome anymore”. He added: “We must stop being reliant on expensive and imported fossil fuels and focus on smarter energy solutions…. I want us to work ever-closer together with countries like Republic of Korea and Japan as we invest more in nuclear technologies like Sizewell and Small Modular Reactors, opening up opportunities to invest in the UK.”",
            "He said the UK “is already taking proactive steps in this space, including through the Nuclear Fuel Fund which launched in January”. This “will provide up to £75m to ensure the UK has the fuel production capabilities needed to support a nuclear renaissance, backing the government’s ambition to secure up to 24GW of nuclear power by 2050”. Furthermore, “The UK has many decades of expertise in nuclear fuel production, which plays a vital role in supporting the energy security of the UK fleet and those of international partners.”",
            "The recent G7 commitments “deal a blow to Russia”, and as more countries move away from fossil fuels and towards renewables, this will cut off a vital income stream for Russia “once and for all”.",
            "In the wake of the G7 meeting, France has come under pressure from Germany, which is now pressing for EU sanctions on Russian nuclear fuel and technology. However, Rosatom remains the world’s biggest exporter of nuclear plants and supplier of nuclear fuel, despite the wider stringent economic sanctions imposed on Russia following its special military operation in Ukraine.",
            "Russia’s nuclear industry has so far been exempted from sanctions. While France relies to some extent on Russian uranium, other European countries including Finland and former East European countries such as Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Hungary still use Russian nuclear fuel. Although US Westinghouse is aiming slowly Russia’s TVEL as a supplier in some countries, this is taking time, especially for countries with VVER-440 reactors. Westinghouse is only now completing development of fuel for such plants. Hungary, moreover, has contracted Rosatom to build two more reactors and clearly intends to go on using Russian fuel. Even the USA still depends on Russian uranium.",

        "text": [
            "A joint special purpose vehicle, PGE PAK Energia Jądrowa SA (PPEJ), has been set up by Polish public company ZE PAK (Zespół Elektrowni Pątnów-Adam-Konin SA) and Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) – both Treasury owned – to implement the project to construct a NPP in Pątnów in central Poland. The plant will comprise two APR1400 reactors supplied by Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP). The company was established just five months after the letter of intent was signed Seoul between PGE, ZE PAK and KHNP. PGE and ZE PAK will each own 50% of the shares in PGE PAK Energia Nuclear, which will secure the interest of the Polish Treasury in the project.",
            "This project is developing in parallel with Poland’s official nuclear power programme. In October, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki announced that the US firm Westinghouse had been selected for the first part of the country's six-reactor plan to build up to 9 GWe of capacity by 2040. The letter of intent about the Pątnów plant says the Korean agreement \"is a new project to supplement the existing Polish government-led nuclear power plant plan\".",
            "Based on the preliminary analyses, it was estimated that at least two APR1400 reactors with a total capacity of 2800 MWe could be considered. These could supply about 12% of current energy demand in Poland, with the first unit starting operation in 2035.",
            "PPEJ will prepare a feasibility study, undertake site research, and prepare an environmental impact assessment for the planned NPP.",
            "It will also represent the Polish side in all stages of the project. These include siting and environmental assessments, obtaining financing and preparing a detailed investment schedule with the Korean side, as well as in the subsequent stages of obtaining permits and making administrative decisions.",
            "The PPEJ Supervisory Board will include 12 members – six from each shareholder. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board will be Ze Pak’s Zygmunt Solorz and the Vice President PGE’s Wojciech Dąbrowski. The company's headquarters is in Konin.",
            "Jacek Sasin, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister & Minister of State Assets, said: “Energy independence is the basis of our security. That is why the Polish government is developing the Polish Nuclear Power Programme…. The power plant, whose construction is planned by Polish companies PGE and ZE PAK together with a Korean partner, will complement this programme. The incorporation of a joint company by PGE and ZE PAK is another step in the realisation of this project. It will be a direct partner of KHNP in the construction of a nuclear power plant in the Konin region. Despite the fact it is a business project, it has the full support of the Polish government. I am confident that its implementation will contribute to reinforcing Poland’s energy security and independence, as well as strengthening our position on the international arena.”",
            "ZE PAK Chairman Zygmunt Solorz said the company representing PGE and ZE PAK from “will automatically take over all tasks related to preparation for this investment and conduct ongoing cooperation with our Korean partners from KHNP”. PGE Board President Wojciech Dąbrowski said, with the support of state authorities as well as local authorities, institutions, offices and bodies responsible for issuing appropriate approvals, permits and decisions, launching the first unit of the NPP “is possible in the middle of the next decade”.",
            "There is, however, continuing uncertainty arising from the efforts of Westinghouse to impeded Korean nuclear exports. Westinghouse in October 2022 alleged that Korea’s APR1400 reactors were copied the System 80 reactor designed by Combustion Engineering, which was acquired by Westinghouse in 2000. The litigation was a move by Westinghouse to stop the Korean companies from selling reactors to Poland, which was then evaluating offers from Westinghouse, KHNP and France’s EDF to supply its first commercial NPP. Although Westinghouse won that tender from state-owned Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe for its AP1000 technology, Korea subsequently signed the agreement with ZE PAK and PGE.",
            "Westinghouse insists that the Korean companies are using its technologies and so they need to obtain the approval of the US government before exporting them to a third country. Korea insists that, while early development of its reactor technology was supported by Westinghouse, the current models it is seeking to export were developed using its own technologies and are not subject to US restrictions. KHNP says the company has developed original reactor technology over the past 30 years and now owns the intellectual property rights to its nuclear power plant technology.",

            "The year 2009 wasn’t good for many and certainly not for Canada’s nuclear industry. The “great recession” that began with the US housing bubble in 2007 was the longest recession since World War II and saw the largest gross domestic product drop in the post-war era. Globally, for the nuclear industry the pains of the recession were exacerbated by the March 2011 tsunami that swamped both the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and, with it, confidence in the industry.",
            "The recession dealt a heavy blow to the Canadian nuclear sector but it weathered Fukushima better than many thanks to strong social license in its host communities. That never faltered. Where some jurisdictions are still in early recovery today and others have remained stalled, the Canadian industry has advanced its capability significantly in the past decade. It is well poised as the world rediscovers nuclear, or in some cases, considers it for the first time, with a new appreciation for its ability to uniquely address the urgency of climate change and energy security.",
            "In Canada, the nuclear sector has spent the past decade steadily employed thanks to massive refurbishment projects and early action on small modular reactors that has helped solidify the industry as a cohesive and effective whole. But the genesis for today’s success traces back to the industry’s response to the adversity it faced in 2009 when its future seemed anything less than certain.",
            "From challenged past to promising future",
            "Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, is the epicentre of nuclear power in Canada. In 2006, the provincial government and its power generation utility, Ontario Power Generation (OPG), began preparations to build two additional large-scale units at OPG’s Darlington Nuclear site. The units would be built alongside the pre- existing four CANDU units (3512 MW total), constructed in the 1990s.",
            "But, in June 2009, after an intense bidding process, the Ontario government cancelled the new build. The decision followed a federal government announcement a few months earlier when it stated it would privatise Atomic Energy Canada Ltd. (AECL), the national original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for CANDU technology, as a valve for taxpayer relief.",
            "In Ontario’s decision to axe its new build, it cited the uncertainty of AECL’s future, and the price tag. The Province said the company had submitted the only fully compliant bid to the terms, which included that the vendor assume all project risks (France’s Areva SA and then US-based Westinghouse Electric Co. had also participated in the bidding). Downward energy-demand forecasts reflecting the gut-kick to the province’s manufacturing sector also factored in the decision.",
            "The fact there was a competitive process at all had generated significant angst. Many felt the two levels of government should have used the opportunity for a domestic build to give AECL, and the supply chain that largely resides in Ontario, a leg up in the international market; a sore spot that remains for some, today.",
            "The new build cancellation felt like a nail in the coffin for beleaguered AECL and equally for the supply chain that relied upon it and on Ontario’s nuclear programme.",
            "At the same time the door closed on new build, decisions had to be made on the province’s existing reactors, coming due for mid-life refurbishments. In February 2010, the Province announced it would move forward with a full refurbishment of the four existing Darlington units. On another timeline, it also signed contracts for Bruce Power to complete life extensions for all of the Bruce’s eight units (6550 MW total) through major component replacements (MCRs). The Province’s commitments were a lifeline but were contingent on on-time, on-budget performance with off-ramps that kicked in if the industry failed to deliver. Recognising the do-or-die reality with no new build in sight, the industry rallied.",
            "The utilities, in collaboration with their Tier-1 suppliers and contractors, invested in innovations in planning, project management, training equipment and techniques as well as procurement and construction. This included integration of artificial intelligence, advanced manufacturing, robotics and virtual reality training techniques, not just in the projects but for more effective operations and outages. To date, the OPG refurbishments and Bruce Power major component replacement project executions have been cause for celebration.",
            "Pickering Nuclear, Canada’s oldest operating plant directly adjacent to Toronto, with six operating units (3100 MW) has received extensions to continue operation beyond the original planned 2020 closure thanks to strong performance in the last decade. In 2022, reflecting the exponential increase in demand for low-carbon electricity, the four newest Pickering Nuclear units (vintage mid-1980s) are now being reviewed for refurbishment feasibility, as well.",
            "The refurbishments aren’t just good news for the carbon- free energy they’ll deliver for the next 30+ years. They have served as the training ground for a cohesive Canadian supply chain that is evolving its expertise to support continued CANDU operation and new SMR technologies, in Canada and globally.",
            "On the strength of the refurbishment performance and the accelerated speed in increased demand for low- carbon energy, in late 2021, OPG leveraged its existing site preparation license (from the new build that never materialized) and selected GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 for Canada’s first on-grid SMR reactor on the Darlington site. In March 2023, the BWRX-300 hit a major licensing milestone when it completed both phases of the Canadian regulatory Vendor Design Review (VDR). OPG, GE-Hitachi and the related supply chain have already begun to export experience here for opportunities in the global market.",
            "A new era for nuclear science in Canada",
            "Meanwhile, at AECL, 14 years on, stability has long been restored. The government-maintained ownership of the nuclear science and technology agenda by creating a Go-Co (government owned-contractor operated) arrangement, currently between AECL and Canadian National Energy Alliance (CNEA), to revitalise and operate Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) at Chalk River and to manage remediation and waste management at several legacy sites. Amongst its priorities, CNL, the architect of the CANDU programme, has pursued an ambitious small modular reactor programme with several global design vendors to support Canada’s SMR goals. Recently, CNL signed several memoranda with Canadian universities to strengthen the talent and research pipeline. Canada has two pre-eminent nuclear engineering and science universities in Ontario: Ontario Tech University and McMaster University, as well as several others that also bring some nuclear-specific education and research. With the nuclear expansion ahead, work is underway to expand the reach of nuclear education across Canada.",
            "AECL also sold its nuclear reactor sales and servicing division to SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian EPC company of more than 50,000 employees, globally, though AECL maintains intellectual property rights. SNC-Lavalin has spent the past decade putting its Canadian nuclear team through its paces as the co-lead on the engineering, construction and procurement activities for the Darlington refurbishment alongside partner Aecon. It is also a preferred supplier on the Bruce Power MCR. In a move it called “transformative” SNC-Lavalin acquired London-based Atkins in 2017, strengthening its global reach and expanding its capabilities.",
            "In January 2023, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon entered another agreement with OPG, this time to deploy the BWRX-300 at Darlington before the end of the decade. But should anyone think this SMR focus means CANDU is forgotten, Bill Fox head of SNC-Lavalin’s Canadian nuclear operations and CEO of its Candu Energy division said otherwise in a March 3rd interview with Energy Intelligence.",
            "“In fact, we’ve been planning a new build CANDU for years, and we never stopped planning,” he said. “We’ve been developing our technology since the acquisition of the commercial operations of AECL and looking at advanced reactor designs… designs that are more economical, that are built with digital tools and reducing valves and making components more passive than active, with (no) operator interventions required.” What’s needed to move forward, he says, is a buyer.",
            "Given the needed scale of new low-carbon power to meet Canada’s legislated goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, many believe it is just a matter of time before the next large-scale procurement begins. For example, even in Ontario, with one of the lowest-carbon electricity grids in the world, the electricity system operator’s recent demand forecast calls for an additional 17,800 MW of nuclear by 2050 in part, for electrification of the province’s transportation and heating needs, currently dependent on oil and gas.",
            "And here enters a possible new twist. Canadian-owned Cameco, one of the world’s largest suppliers of nuclear fuel with end-to-end services from mining to processing, announced in October 2022 that it was partnering with another Canadian energy powerhouse, Brookfield Renewables, to acquire Westinghouse Electric. In addition to strengthening Cameco’s dominance in fuel, including HALEU capability for SMRs, it also means Cameco and Brookfield Renewables will have ownership of the AP1000 and e-Vinci micro reactor designs, the latter of which is actively in the Canadian market already. Westinghouse opens Cameco up to greater opportunities globally, but it will be interesting to see what it means for the Canadian playing field, as well.",
            "A half century ago, if you worked in nuclear in Canada, odds were, you worked for AECL or Ontario Hydro, the predecessor mega-utility from which OPG spawned. Today, what it means to be a Canadian in nuclear is as diverse as Canada’s multicultural diaspora.",
            "There are more than a half dozen active purpose-build SMR design firms working in the domestic market, including one Canadian-founded one, Terrestrial Energy. With the Westinghouse acquisition, there are now two Canadian-owned large-scale technologies.",
            "There is a vibrant supply community of more than 200 companies ready to take Canadian experience to other markets, across the technologies they’ve worked on here. Universities and colleges are building the talent pools and collaborating globally to support others looking to do the same.",
            "The Canadian regulator has advanced SMRs through a vendor design review process and leveraging collaboration with other jurisdictions for a harmonised approach that Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission President Rumina Velshi says is to “protect people from risk, not to hinder progress.”",
            "Canada’s Nuclear Waste Management Organization is well on track to site a deep geologic repository for long-term management of the nation’s spent fuel to ensure a socially accepted solution to nuclear sustainability.",
            "There are industries looking to decarbonise with micro and small reactors at their sites. And, there are communities across Canada, small and large, including Indigenous communities, who are engaging as active partners to be part of workforces and to power their lives and economies with nuclear technologies.",
            "For the first time in a long time, the federal government acknowledges the importance of nuclear in Canada’s energy mix. The industry is hoping it will do more, like counterparts in other jurisdictions, such as the UK. Because nuclear has become part of Canada’s DNA and the country is ready to take it global.",
            "Now it can only hope that this time, recessionary forecasts and unsettled geopolitics do not overtake the world’s commitment to a clean energy future.",

            "Slovenian nuclear utility Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško (NEK) says the new used fuel dry storage facility at its Krško NPP has been commissioned with the placement by US-based Holtec International of the first HI-STORM FW cask. NEK received the operating licence for the facility from the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (URSJV – Uprava republike Slovenije za jedrsko varnost) in October 2022. Holtec said the first fuel loading campaign will see 16 HI-STORM FW casks placed into the facility.",
            "NEK said the introduction of dry storage for used fuel represents “a transition from active to passive solutions, as no additional device, system or energy source is needed to provide cooling”. NEK added that it was necessary to carry out several administrative procedures in accordance with spatial, environmental, construction and nuclear legislation. “We successfully completed the process of amending and supplementing the NPP Regulatory Plan, which included a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and cross-border consultation with Croatia and Austria, in March 2020. We obtained an integral building permit in February 2021.” An environmental and cross-border impact assessment was also carried out.",
            "The storage facility measures 50 by 70 by 20 metres. The reinforced concrete base plate is 1.75 metres thick, and along with the perimeter walls, provides stability for anchoring the storage containers in place. Monitoring of radiation and temperature is installed as well as the required infrastructure for monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
            "The used fuel will be stored in casks each holding 37 fuel rods. The thick concrete shell provides mechanical and radiological protection. Cooling is provided by free air flow. Holtec says the facility is designed to withstand earthquake levels only encountered in high seismic regions of the world, such as California and the Western Pacific, although the seismic hazard at the site is not that high. It is also designed to function under severe flood conditions and to attenuate the accreted dose from the facility to minuscule levels to protect public health and safety. Construction involved rigorous quality assurance controls and local supply chain management, primarily consisting of Slovenian, Croatian and Italian companies.",
            "The seismic restraint system uses a robust steel structure embedded within the thick concrete foundation of the storage building. The HI-STORM FW casks are qualified to a severe earthquake level that produces foundation pad accelerations 2.1 times higher than the earth’s gravity. Furthermore, the storage modules are also engineered to withstand impact from a military or commercial aircraft, exceeding the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) guidance for operating nuclear power plants. The custom-engineered domed lid of the HI-STORM FW, unique to this project, is a Holtec innovation developed to engineer an impact-capable design.",
            "Holtec says that, as part of the transboundary commenting process, it was decided to implement a non-intrusive leak-indication system to continuously monitor the welded multi-purpose canisters containing the fuel. The system monitors the temperature profile of the casks to detect potential depressurisation. The HI-STORM FW system is designed and licensed as “leak-tight” and the monitoring system serves only as an additional safety measure.",
            "NEK said this technology provides a high level of safety for workers and the environment during the transfer of the used fuel elements from the pool to containers and the transport of the containers to the dry storage as well as for the entire period of temporary storage. The containers can also be used to transport the used fuel to a final repository in future. “In the first campaign, we will move 16 containers with 592 used fuel rods to dry storage by autumn. The transfer will be supervised by URSJV, and it will also be monitored by authorised organisations.",
            "Operation of the dry storage will meet all the conditions needed for the extension of the operation of the Krško NPP. The Krško NPP has a final environmental consent to extend its service life for an additional 20 years (to 2043). The 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor was the first western NPP in eastern Europe. Construction started in 1975 and it began commercial operation in 1983.",
            "In accordance with Slovenian legislation, the third periodic safety inspection is underway during which URSJV ensures the NPP meets the criteria for operation over the next 10 years in accordance with the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It should be completed by the end of the year.",
            "“By moving the first 592 used fuel elements to a dry storage facility, we will complete the dry storage project. In this way, we will meet all the conditions and enforce the decisions of the administrative bodies for the extension of the operation of the Krško NPP,” NEK says.",

This has increased concerns that Korea’s plans to boost its nuclear reactor exports may continue to be stalled by ongoing litigation with Westinghouse Electric Company.",
            "The documents, which were submitted to the US District Court in Washington, showed that KHNP had submitted the relevant paperwork to the Department of Energy (DOE) in December in compliance with the US Code of Federal Regulations. This requires DOE approval, or a prior report to the DOE, in order to transfer certain nuclear power technologies.",
            "According to the Code, companies planning to export NPPs to the Czech Republic only need to report the activity within 30 days of the beginning of related operations. Having taken the necessary steps, KHNP said it should have been given the right to export its NPPs to the Czech Republic. However, ongoing litigation with Westinghouse is complicating the situation.",
            "In January, DOE said in a letter to KHNP that the report to DOE must be submitted by \"US Persons”, namely Westinghouse, which earlier filed a lawsuit with a US federal court against KHNP and Kepco. Westinghouse in October 2022 alleged that Korea’s APR1400 reactors were copied the System 80 reactor designed by Combustion Engineering, which was acquired by Westinghouse in 2000. The litigation was a move by Westinghouse to stop the Korean companies stop them from selling reactors to Poland, which was then evaluating offers from Westinghouse, KHNP and France’s EDF to supply its first commercial NPP. Although Westinghouse won that tender from state-owned Polskie Elektrownie Jądrowe for its AP1000 technology, Korea subsequently signed an agreement with a private companies ZE PAK and PGE (Polska Grupa Energetyczna) to supply its APR1400 reactors at another site.",
            "Westinghouse insists that the Korean companies are using its technologies and so they need to obtain the approval of the US government before exporting them to a third country. Westinghouse company is also asking the court to block KHNP’s potential deal with Saudi Arabia.",
            "Korea, on the other hand, claims that, while early development of its reactor technology was supported by Westinghouse, the current models it is seeking to export were developed using its own technologies and are not subject to US restrictions. KHNP says the company has developed original reactor technology over the past 30 years and now owns the intellectual property rights to its nuclear power plant technology.",
            "“We have decided that the best course of action is to accommodate DOE’s response and its request that KHNP works with (Westinghouse) in order to prevent further complication of the issues pending in the case between Westinghouse and KHNP,” said KHNP in a letter to Westinghouse. “Accordingly, we expect that Westinghouse will take actions as it deems necessary to file a report with DOE regarding submission of KHNP’s bid,” it added.",
            "KHNP issued a statement later the same day saying that the US government was not blocking exports to the Czech Republic, and explaining that the letter from the DOE was a response to instruct the procedures. \"Regarding the Czech Republic's nuclear power plant project, KHNP submitted its bid in November and the bidding process of the open competition is ongoing,\" it said.",
            "For the time being, the legal wrangling continues. Westinghouse and Kepco/KHNP had until 17 March to resolve their failure means shifted from the US District Court for the District of Columbia to the Korean Commercial Arbitration Board. The origins of the dispute go back to 2017, when Riyadh issued a request for information to five vendors: France's EDF, Russia's Rosatom, China National Nuclear Corp, Kepco and Westinghouse. The Korean companies in the meantime had won the tender to build four APR1400 units in the United Arab Emirates. The Al-Barakah NPP project is now almost complete – on schedule and on budget. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has made nuclear central to his energy and trade policies and aims to export 10 reactors by 2030.",
            "In January, the UAE pledged a $30bn investment in South Korea \"strengthening strategic cooperation in the four core cooperative sectors of nuclear power, energy, investment and defence” and agreed to strengthen nuclear co-operation, including \"joint advancement into third countries”.",
            "The Investor noted: “The commercial possibility here is that Abu Dhabi's money might backstop a Korean nuclear export drive – possibly through equity or debt investments in Korean-supplied newbuilds – in a way that makes Kepco and KHNP frightening competition for Westinghouse.” It added: “Not only does Westinghouse see a commercial necessity, therefore, in blocking Kepco and KHNP from competing for newbuild business in Poland, the Czech Republic and Saudi Arabia, it wants to reassert its dominance in the global nuclear export market.”",
            "Saudi Arabia is one of the few markets where the Korean firms and Westinghouse are no longer direct competitors. Westinghouse was excluded from Riyadh's large reactor newbuild tender at the beginning of 2022. This was largely because of US conditions whereby any country importing US technology must signs a legally-binding commitment to not pursue uranium enrichment or reprocessing. Washington, further, in 2021 signed a bilateral agreement with South Korea pledging to only export reactors to countries adhering to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol, which provides for stepped-up agency safeguards.",
            "The Investor suggests that if settlement negotiations between South Korea and Washington fail, Kepco and KHNP “could continue to pursue reactor exports despite the legal challenge and potentially suffer the commercial and legal fallout from Westinghouse and Washington”. However, “Warsaw and Prague might be reluctant to move forward on Korean-supplied reactor deals if the US government applies enough pressure.” The Saudi deal, however, remains a possibility.",

At that time Vogtle 3&4 were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017 but suffered a series of delays.",
            "“What an incredibly inspiring time to join Georgia Power as we celebrate this milestone that marks the first day of generating clean, reliable power at this new nuclear unit, which will serve our customers over the next 60 to 80 years,” said Kim Greene, Chairman, President & CEO of Georgia Power. “I consider myself very fortunate to have worked onsite at Vogtle 1&2 early in my career as an engineer, learning so much that I have carried with me over the years while also gaining an appreciation of the value of nuclear energy as a critical, long-term investment for our state. As we approach commercial operation for Unit 3, I know that every professional who has been involved in this project or worked at Plant Vogtle is proud of the role they have played in helping build a clean energy future for Georgia.”",
            "Connecting to the electric grid is part of ongoing start-up testing for Vogtle 3, and operators will continue to increase reactor power while performing tests at various levels.

        "title": "Swapping steam generators at Watts Bar",
        "text": [
            "Unit 2 of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar nuclear power plant returned to service last summer after replacing the reactor’s four steam generators. Although Watts Bar Unit 2 is America’s newest nuclear plant, construction actually began in 1972. It was suspended in 1985 having been about 55% complete when construction stopped. Work was resumed in 2007 and commercial operations at the 1165MWe Westinghouse PWR started in October 2016. A year earlier the NRC had approved a forty- year operating license for Unit 2, which is located on a 1700 acre (688 Ha) site on the northern end of Chickamauga Reservoir, near Spring City in Eastern Tennessee. Operated by TVA, Unit 2 was built at a construction cost of some $4.7 billion.",
            "Although unit 2 has only been operating for around six years, the existing steam generators had been installed during the earlier construction phase. “The steam generators were the original steam generators that were installed and not in use since the 1970s or early 1980s. They were laid up for that time so they were older steam generators,” explains Carol Barajas, vice president of the Watts Bar steam generator replacement project.",
            "“We expected them to last approximately 10 years and we knew we would have to replace them so when we started unit two back in 2016. We had ordered from Westinghouse the four new steam generators. They didn’t arrive on site until 2018,” Barajas adds. Westinghouse had supplied the original units also.",
            "The decision to replace the steam generators was based on the fact that they were an older design and used inferior alloys that are known to be susceptible to stress corrosion cracking and can therefore prematurely develop leaks and other problems.",
            "Indeed, unit 1 at Watts Bar had already had its steam generators replaced in the early 2000s with an upgraded version of the Westinghouse design using the new alloy 690 which is more robust and resistant to stress corrosion cracking.",
            "“Most of the industry in the United States have, for pressurized water reactors, replaced their steam generators with the new Westinghouse alloy 690 version and TVA had already upgraded all of its existing reactor fleet. We did upgrade them on Watts Barr unit one and both Sequoia unit one and two. The steam generators were replaced with the new Westinghouse generators in the 2000 to 2012 time frame and unit two at Watts Bar was the last pressurized water reactor where we had to replace the steam generators,” says Barajas.",
            "TVA owns and operates several additional nuclear installations and seven reactors in the state, including Browns Ferry and Sequoia.",
            "A long-term steam solution",
            "Although the old units hadn’t failed after only six years of use and they were still operational, by replacing them early the plant owner aimed to remove some risk of the plant shutting down as a result of failures within the steam generators. The plan was to avoid an unexpected outage. TVA monitors crack propagation within the steam generator and chose to execute the replacement programme before actual degradation occurred to the point where any cracking had been observed in the steam tubes in the old units. “We do condition monitoring on the steam generators during every refuel outage. We’re monitoring this stress corrosion cracking and trend over time the condition. We determined that we needed to replace them,” notes Barajas.",
            "In fact, having determined that replacements were required early on during the operational life of the plant, TVA accelerated its replacement programme at unit 2 by around 18 months. Barajas explains: “We ended up replacing the steam generators on unit 2 one refuelling cycle before we had originally planned to be proactive and ensure that we weren’t going to have any issues.”",
            "As part of this industry-wide replacement programme TVA is also anticipating a potential life extension of this plant and others within its reactor fleet.",
            "“The purpose of investing in these new steam generators is so that we can operate the plant safely and reliably over many years to come. We expect the new steam generators to last the remainder of the plant life – that could be anywhere from 40 to 60 years,” she says, adding: “The plants have potentially a 40-odd year life remaining and of course unit two at Watts Bar just came online and it has a 40-year life expectancy but we do expect down the road to potentially request license renewal.”",
            "If the life extension operating licence is requested and approved a full 60-year life would see unit 2 operating for another 54 years. However, the life expectancy of the replacement steam generators offers scope for an even longer life. As Barajas says: “There’s no actual expiration of these steam generators, they could last a lot longer than that. With this new design we expect it to last the lifetime of the plant and that means anywhere from a minimum of 40 years potentially up to 60 or 80 years based on how they progress.”",
            "The Steam Generating Team (SGT), a joint venture between Framatome and United Engineers & Constructors, Inc., was contracted by TVA to execute the steam generator replacement programme.",
            "“We worked through planning and preparations for approximately a year and selecting SGT was really because of their record, their expertise and their knowledge of industry operating experience. SGT had performed one of our steam generator replacements at Sequoia previously so we were familiar with them. They were able to take all of the different lessons learned from all of the steam generator replacements they’ve done and make sure that we put the right contingencies in place to do it efficiently and effectively,” says Barajas. She adds: “Because completing the task within a relatively narrow time window was an important part of the process, when we brought them on site we went through the process methodically making sure that the key people that were brought in had the experience that we needed.”",
            "Barajas emphasises the importance of experience in executing such projects: “Obviously, it’s a very large construction project on an operating nuclear site so the reliance on an expert that has done many steam generator replacements before was beneficial.”",
            "The steam generators are large components. Each of the original units is 67-feet (20m) long and weighs some 360-tonnes. To remove and replace them through the reactor building, temporary openings had to be cut in the reactor building dome, containment and steam generator enclosures.",
            "“Because of the design of Watts Bar we had to cut two large holes, one on each side, on top of our containment approximately 45 feet by 22 feet (13.7 x 6.7m) to access the two steam generator compartments. We have two steam generators per compartment, so we had to cut the top of the concrete shield building dome which is about two feet (60cm) thick,” explains Barajas. “We did use a machine cutting robot that sat on top of containment to cut and process the concrete to remove it,” she says, adding: “Once we were done cutting the shield building, we had to cut the steel reactor vessel liner to about the same size and then in the steam generator compartment we had to cut two holes in the concrete to access each of the two steam generators. It was pretty much a deconstruction of the shield building and the reactor vessel in order access and remove the four steam generators through the top of the building.”",
            "This method was chosen because it wasn’t possible to disassemble the steam generators from within the containment building itself due to their level of contamination.",
            "“We wanted to keep them intact and once we removed the old steam generators they were stored on site in the secure dry storage mausoleum. They’ll remain on site until final decommissioning, however long that is,” notes Barajas.",
            "For the removal of the old steam generators a combination of both machine and manual cutting using different methods were deployed to sever the pipe connections. Barajas says: “Across the four steam generators you’ve got small bore pipes, large bore pipes, main steam pipes, a lot of instrument lines that had to be cut. We have to use tools for cutting that are used by our pipe fitters and pipe fitter welders but it really is a combination of these approaches.”",
            "Precision measurements and meticulous metrology practices were used to support the necessary lifting operations, which were performed using a Sarens DMAG 8800 crawler crane. Some 22 significantly heavy lifts were performed during the project. “SGT hired Sarens, which constructed the world’s second largest crane on site in order to be able to remove the four steam generators and install the new steam generators in addition to removing concrete shield building dome pieces and the steel containment vessel liner on both sides,” says Barajas.",
            "Once the original steam generators had been removed the replacements were lifted into place with 3D fit-up solutions and specialised machining enabling precise placement back into the existing plant configuration. More than 4000 welds were required to install the new steam generators. Due to the potential radiological hazard associated with working close to the reactor pressure vessel several of the installation welds were performed by robotic welding systems developed by Framatome. “One of the reasons we were successful in our steam generator replacement was good preparation and being ready for any issues with the amount of mock-ups and pre-planning key,” says Barajas, adding: “An example would be the use of machine welding on the reactor coolant system piping that attaches to the steam generators. We worked with Framatome closely and they did some innovative machine welding. By replicating the environment that they would have to do the welding at Watts Bar we were able to work out any issues that they had and were also able to prove that the equipment was going to work. The whole process of welding large bore pipe was very successful and was done on time because of that additional mock-up preparation and testing of the machine welding operation.”",
            "Having reconnected all the pipework and instrumentation the openings in the steam generators compartments and the containment vessel had to be repaired. “We had to reinstall the concrete on top of the steam generator enclosure blocks, along with re-welding the steel containment vessel liners on each side. Then we had to pour new concrete on top of the shield building dome to make the shield building dome intact,” says Barajas.",
            "During the steam generator programme a range of other repair and maintenance activities were also undertaken, including a refueling in which 88 of Unit 2’s 193 fuel assemblies were replaced. In addition, more reliable low pressure turbine blades were installed, main turbine controls and feedwater heaters were upgraded and other plant equipment was either replaced or serviced and inspected.",
            "Planning for project success",
            "The outage for the steam generator replacement began in March 2022 and was concluded at the end of June. As Barajas says: “For such a big project that seems like a very short amount of time. That’s why I wanted to emphasize the amount of preparation and planning that we did, incorporating operating experience and lessons learned from other steam generator placements to make it as efficient as possible.”",
            "There were additional challenges associated with executing a large construction project within 50 or 60 feet (15-18 m) of another reactor operating at 100%. “There are some systems that are common between Watts Bar unit 1 and unit 2. A key part was the safety of operating unit one and ensuring unit 1 operated reliably throughout the process of deconstruction and reconstruction of unit 2,” she adds, noting: “A lot of preparation and planning also had to take into account that we had an operating unit and making sure that we were not going to put that unit at risk throughout the process, for example through lifting heavy objects nearby.”",
            "Prior to Watts Bar, the last steam generator replacement carried out by TVA had been over 10 years ago. Enough time so that some of the proficiencies that were gained then could be dissipated. Nonetheless, the latest, and last, replacement programme was deemed a success. “There’s obviously challenges with a large construction project that you have to work through. We focused more on the safety of our people, the environment, nuclear safety and radiological safety so when we say the steam generator placement was successful it was based on those four factors. We had no related recordable injuries so it was very safe and error-free and that’s what we focus on,” says Barajas.",
            "Overall, replacement of the steam generators delivered an opportunity to increase operating life of the reactor and to improve the plant reliability by addressing a well- known degrading component. But the steam generator upgrade yielded other benefits too.",
            "Although the core steam characteristics haven’t changed the generators are now more efficient and TVA is actually getting more power out of the plant now the steam generators have been replaced. “One of the features is increased efficiency. There’s also been some internal modifications done but coming out of the Unit 2 outage we saw about a 20 MWe increase based on the replacement of the four steam generators. It definitely benefits the plant and now we can generate more electricity to provide to our customers,” concludes Barajas."

Westinghouse says it will deliver fuel beginning in 2024, “replacing the current supplier, with an anticipated term of seven years”. The current fuel supplier is Russia’s TVEL.",
            "According to Westinghouse, the contract “builds on the long-standing partnership between the two companies and a recent agreement to provide modified Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assemblies (RWFA) for the Temelin nuclear power plant”. The Temelin NPP comprises two Russian-designed VVER-1000 units.",
            "CEZ Group concluded contracts with Westinghouse and France’s Framatome in 2022 for the supply of fuel assemblies for the Temelín NPP. Deliveries of assemblies for more than 10 years will begin in 2024. Previously fuel was supplied by TVEL. Currently, CEZ has fuel assemblies for approximately two years of operation at Temelin. The stock at the Dukovany NPP is even greater, CEZ said. \"We decided to increase the stockpile at both NPPs in 2016. As a result, we have enough assemblies at Dukovany for approximately three years of operation of all the units, said Bohdan Zronek, Director of the Cez Nuclear Power Division, at that time. “Of course, we continue to think about the diversification of suppliers,\" he added.",
            "TVEL had long been the fuel supplier for all of CEZ’s NPPs. However, after outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine CEZ began looking for alternative suppliers. While Westinghouse had earlier developed fuel for VVER-1000 reactors, but the design for VVER-440 fuel was still under development. At the end of 2022, Spain’s Enusa Industrias Avanzadas and Westinghouse formalised a cooperation agreement regarding the manufacture of VVER-440 fuel. Enusa began to reinstall a production line for this product at its Juzbado factory with the aim of licensing it in 2023 to make possible fuel deliveries from the beginning of 2024.",
            "Through this agreement, Westinghouse and Enusa will manufacture the fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain, as supply contracts are signed.",
            "Westinghouse and Enusa have partnered since 1974 under a Pressurised-Water Reactor (PWR) fuel technology transfer agreement supporting plants in Spain, Belgium, and France among others. In 1999, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) bought Westinghouse’s commercial nuclear power businesses. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to Fortum’s Loviisa NPP in Finland, which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "These designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006 when Westinghouse was purchased by Toshiba. However, the Loviisa fuel contract was not renewed and Westinghouse withdrew from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "In 2014 reactivation of the VVER-440 market was reconsidered and Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe. It was granted €2m in 2015 to run the European Supply of Safe Nuclear Fuel (ESSANUF) HORIZON 2020 project. Both Enusa and Westinghouse worked together on the ESSANUF project in 2015-2017. Others involved in ESSANUF included VUJE (Slovakia), UJV Rez (Czech Republic), Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland), UK National Nuclear Laboratory, NucleoCon (Slovakia), Kharkiv Institute of Physics & Technology, and the European Commission Joint Research Centre in Karlsruhe (JRC–Karlsruhe). The project was funded under the Euratom Research & Training Programme (2014-2018), which is part of the EU Research & Innovation Framework Horizon 2020.\"",

The signing ceremony was attended by the Minister of Energy of Ukraine Herman Halushchenko (online); the High Commissioner of Canada to the UK, Ralph Goodale; and the Ambassador of Ukraine to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko.",
            "\"In accordance with the agreements, between 2024 and 2035 Energoatom will be fully provided with natural uranium hexafluoride, which will be supplied for enrichment and further use in the production of nuclear fuel. It is also expected to sell uranium mined at the Ukraine’s VostokGOK [Eastern Mining & Processing Plant] to Canada,\" the Ukrainian Energy Ministry said in a statement on its website.",
            "Energoatom and Cameco said in February that they had agreed on commercial terms for the supply in 2024-2035 of uranium hexafluoride, which will be used in the production of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Cameco is expected to supply 100% of Energoatom's uranium hexafluoride needs for reactors at the Rovno, Khmelnitsky and Southern Ukrainian Nuclear Power Plants during the term of the contract. The total demand of these plants for the 12-year period is about 15,300 tonnes of uranium hexafluoride (the equivalent of about 40.1m pounds of uranium concentrate (U3O8).",
            "“We are grateful and glad to be the partner of Energoatom and Ukraine in the nuclear sector. Our teams have cooperated efficiently in order to get to the signing of these arrangements and agree to collaborate at least until 2035, said Gitzel. “This is one of the largest and most important contracts for Cameco. Our company will help Ukraine retain its energy independence.”.",
            "According to Kotin, the agreements are extremely important as Energoatom has terminated all contracts for supply of nuclear fuel from Russia. He also added that taking into account the situation in the global market and the existing shortage of conversion capabilities, the contracts would guarantee stability in nuclear fuel supply.",
            "The contracts also contain an option for Cameco to supply up to 100% of the fuel requirements for the six reactors at the Zaporizhia NPP, currently under Russian control, should it return to Energoatom’s operation. If this option was exercised in 2024, the plant would require around 27.2m pounds of U3O8 over the contract period.",

        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. “While the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,” according to NEA. “Recent NEA analysis … finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.”",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

NEA also classifies them according to reactor configurations including 17 land-based designs; five multi-module designs; three marine-based designs; and one mobile design.",
            "NEA notes that SMRs can replace fossil fuels for on-grid power generation, diesel generators for off-grid mining and industrial operations, and fossil fuels for cogeneration of heat and power for heavy industries and district heating. They can also enable large-scale water treatment and desalination to produce clean potable water. “These varied market needs have prompted the development of a range of SMR technologies, which vary in technology, sizes, and configuration.” NEA comments: “Policymakers are often overwhelmed with this great variety as they strive to consider which designs might meet their particular needs and in what time frame.”",
            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci. Meanwhile, Russia’s KLT40S and China’s HTR-PM are already in operation.",
            "Much greater detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. This provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. The 424 pages provide details of the technologies involved while Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines. The first booklet in this series was first published in 2014 and serves as a supplement to the IAEA’s Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), an online database with comprehensive information on the latest developments in advanced reactors.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction to the latest edition: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",
            "All the other designs, including those mentioned by NEA, are either in the pre-conceptual/conceptual or basic/detailed design stages. Those still in the conceptual design stage include U Battery, eVinci, Nuward and Sealer-55.",
            "IAEA notes that the technical description and major technical parameters in the booklet “were provided by the design organisations without validation or verification by the IAEA. All figures, illustrations and tables in technical description of each design were also provided by the design organisations.” A similar caveat is given by NEA."

            "US-based Westinghouse Electric Company has received approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to use its Advanced Doped Pellet Technology (ADOPT) fuel pellets in US pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The approval came after both NRC and the Advanced Committee on Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) verified that ADOPT fuel significantly enhances the safety and reliability of PWRs.",
            "The technology was developed with funding from the US Department of Energy (DOE) with the aim of increasing the accident tolerance of conventional uranium dioxide fuel pellets. An agreement was announced in 2022 with Southern Nuclear Company to load rods using High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) ADOPT pellets “with licensing and manufacturing in 2023”. Westinghouse said it is contracted to deliver reload quantities of ADOPT fuel for three units beginning in 2025. HALEU fuel is enriched to between 5% and 19.75% – significantly higher than standard fuel used in commercial reactors. Westinghouse says the increased uranium density of ADOPT fuel improves fuel cycle economics and extends fuel operating cycles.",
            "Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel, said ADOPT fuel has become “the first product within Westinghouse’s EnCore accident tolerant fuel (ATF) programme that is licensed for US PWRs”. He added that ADOPT fuel “is the result of two decades of in-reactor experience and provides our customers with improved fuel cycle economics and safety margins”.",
            "ADOPT fuel is a near-term fuel product within the EnCore Fuel programme. Westinghouse says the fuel’s enlarged grain size and increased density offers key benefits including:",
            "Increased density of fissile material",
            "Lower transient fission gas release",
            "Increased Pellet Clad Interaction margins",
            "Enhanced corrosion & washout resistance",
            "ADOPT fuel is an improved uranium dioxide (UO2) design, doped with small amounts of chromia (Cr2O3) and alumina (Al2O3). By utilising small amount of alumina, Westinghouse has been able to keep the amount of chromium (a parasitic neutron absorber) to a minimum, thereby improving neutron efficiency. ADOPT fuel can be used in all Westinghouse and Combustion Engineering PWR and boiling water reactor (BWR) designs, and is compatible with all zirconium-based cladding materials and fuel enrichments.",
            "Westinghouse says the ADOPT pellet design achieves greater uranium efficiency through an approximate 2% increase in fissile material, compared with conventional UO2 products. This increased uranium density promotes core design flexibility and higher discharge burnups. ADOPT fuel is also expected to provide additional safety benefits in terms of fuel fragmentation, relocation, and dispersal in an event such as a loss-of-coolant accident. Increased thermal stability allows for more accurate prediction and enhanced control of pellet cladding gap closure. ADOPT fuel exhibits reduced Pellet Clad Interaction under accident conditions due to its enhanced creep rates at high temperatures. With an oxidation rate 50% less than conventional UO2, ADOPT fuel is expected to have reduced wash-out in the event of a fuel rod leaker.",

The two sites in Dětmarovice and Tušimice are currently coal-fired power plants, which are being transformed for emission-free operation. As part of its Vision 2030, ČEZ Group is committed to preparing for the construction of SMRs with a total capacity of over 1,000 MWe after 2040.",

However, initial analysis has already recommended that the Poříčí power plant location should not be further developed due to the almost certain presence of a nearby active fault near the site, which precludes the placement of nuclear technology.",
            "\"Small modular reactors are not a substitute for large nuclear units, but a complement to the energy mix of the Czech Republic as a suitable replacement for coal-fired power plants and large thermal power plants,” says Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ Board of Directors and Chief Renewables Officer. “The SMR construction programme represents a great opportunity for the Czech economy. It offers production of nuclear equipment, substantial involvement in the supply chain, and the creation of a regional service and training centre.”",
            "He added: “In order to take advantage of the opportunities of the SMR programme, action must be taken quickly. We expect that new nuclear sources, including SMRs, will also be significantly represented in the upcoming update of the State Energy Concept. This, in the long term, builds the Czech energy mix on a combination of nuclear and renewable sources.\"",
            "The Dětmarovice and Tušimice power plant sites will undergo further intensive exploration and monitoring before it is finally clear whether they are suitable locations for a nuclear power source. The exploration work, which began in the first half of February, is primarily focused on excluding the existence of active tectonic faults, assessing the hydrogeology of the area and analysing the bedrock. This phase should be completed by the autumn and others will then follow. ČEZ noted that the transformation of a non-nuclear site into a nuclear site requires a series of exploration activities lasting 3-5 years before the permit process can begin.",
            "The first SMR will be built near the Temelín NPP and should be completed before the new large nuclear unit is launched at the site, which is planned for 2040. ČEZ cooperates with the South Bohemian region and its subsidiary ÚJV Řež as part of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park, which covers research, development and preparation for construction. While the investor for the SMR has yet to be decided the site has been decided. The area is part of the wider Temelín NPP site, which has recently undergone a special seismic mission.",
            "ČEZ Group has already signed a memoranda of cooperation om SMRs with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, Westinghouse, KHNP and Holtec. ČEZ says it is ready to participate in the scientific research activities and development of SMRS for all these companies through its ÚJV Řež subsidiary.",

            "Above: Siteflow is a workflow management tool",
            "In recent years a growing number of industrial sectors have been turning to technology to help them remain competitive in increasingly fast-paced and challenging business environments. In the nuclear sector, however, the adoption of digital tools has been somewhat slower.",
            "This is set to change as nuclear power producers and their service providers come under renewed pressure to increase production capacity whilst also improving quality, reliability and accountability.",
            "As a result, the nuclear industry is starting to look more keenly at the digital tools that could help them. One digital tool that aims to achieve those goals is Siteflow, a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) platform for service providers working in complex, highly regulated industries like nuclear. According to its developers it is the first digital solution of its kind.",
            "Siteflow was founded in 2017 by four civil engineers working in the nuclear sector who were weighed down by paper-heavy processes and reporting requirements. Siteflow CEO Louis Hauvette comments: “For every nuclear assignment, around 70% of our time was spent dealing with paperwork. After years of study and training this seemed a poor use of skills. We felt that the hours spent on admin could and should be put to better use”.",
            "This is a pain point shared by many, as Celine Wolf, Director of Strategy, Growth and Innovation for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Westinghouse, explains:",
            "“As with other sensitive industries, any onsite service carried out in the nuclear sector will typically necessitate vast amounts of manually-produced documents at every stage of the procedure; including quality and compliance reports and so on. This documentation, being drawn up and often photocopied, is not only time consuming to produce, creating operational bottlenecks but also increases the risk of errors”.",
            "Westinghouse deployed the Siteflow tool in 2022 to help them manage and track the wide range of services they provide. It was the first such external digital tool adopted by the nuclear services company. A platform and tablet workflow management system that works both on- and off-line to structure and streamline technical onsite operations, Siteflow covers everything from construction to maintenance, health and safety upgrades and decommissioning. According to Siteflow, it can be tailored to any working environment and covers any field operation. The platform is also ISO Certified.",
            "“At Westinghouse we were looking for a digital tool that would enable us to organise and streamline our services. We assessed a few solutions that were adapted to our needs. Siteflow had the edge because it combines reliable site operation management with business efficiency. It provides us with operational autonomy and allows real time coordination between onsite and back-office teams, while ensuring data protection through integrated cyber security systems,” says Wolf.",
            "Field technicians, contractors and subcontractors using Siteflow are equipped with tablets that instruct and guide them through each step of any required onsite procedure. Checklists and forms – from listings of required materials and apparatus, to work instructions and automatic risk checks – are automatically generated at every stage. This allows office teams to track real time onsite progress and stay informed if any setbacks occur.",
            "Errors become easily identifiable and operational crews, freed from numerous traditional paper files, can focus on the technical and operational aspects. This supports improvements in the quality of maintenance operations. According to Siteflow, the overall result for users is improved performance with lower costs, fewer non-conformities and reduced error rates, as well as complete traceability and considerable time saving. As Hauvette explains: “The operational advantages of using Siteflow lie in its ability to comply with mandatory regulatory reporting requirements by automatically generating the necessary documentation for each service provided. This is a huge time saver for those operating in complex and continually evolving regulatory environments”.",
            "As Wolf says: “Being able to efficiently generate quality compliance reports on time is key. Siteflow automatic report generation is an enabler for efficient, flawless and timely generation of final service reports”.",
            "Another big plus is improved employee experience with paperless workflows. This is expected to having a strong positive impact on employee satisfaction levels and thus support staff retention.",
            "“By eliminating paper heavy processes, Siteflow removes a major pain point for operations crews and therefore improves job satisfaction. It also helps create a more modern, collaborative and attractive environment for both younger and older crew members” says Hauvette.",
            "When it comes to digital transformation, however, ensuring employee buy-in from the outset can prove tricky, particularly in sectors like the nuclear industry. As Wolf confirms: “Shifting from paper to a digital tool meant adapting, at a certain level, our internal processes and learning to think differently. In the nuclear industry, we are relying on tried, demonstrated and tested methods and processes to safely perform our work. That said, transitioning to a digital solution to support our work on site lead us to question some of our habits and ways of working in a healthy manner. Any transformation in the way we work requires effective change management and employee involvement. At Westinghouse, one of the ways we handled it was to set up multi-skilled teams, involving operational key crew members, managers, digital solution specialists from Siteflow. We also defined and executed operational pilot projects and got strongly grounded feedback from the field, eventually working collaboratively to bring forward a solution fitting the overall needs, in terms of customer, compliance, operation and process requirements. It was also a good team bonding exercise”.",
            "To ensure a relatively painless adoption of its software, Siteflow says it provides clients with dedicated training sessions and a hotline service for questions or difficulties. “Overall, the feedback from our crews has been very positive. The adoption by the operators and field service crews was easy, with no issues for the crews on site in using the tablet and working “in digital”, even those who are less at ease with tech and computers. This was a nice surprise.",
            "Ergonomic and intuitive use are key factors in success when adopting new tools,” notes Wolf.",
            "Hauvette welcomes the positive response, but emphasises that there is no room for complacency. The Siteflow strategy therefore also involves actively partnering with customers to ensure the platform remains best-in-class. “Today 70% of company resources are dedicated to continually developing Siteflow and creating one standard software that can be adapted to any industrial use case,” Hauvette notes. Data and development being inextricably linked, energy producers looking to optimise operations and improve the performance of assets across the value chain are now demanding more exploitable data from their service providers. Ensuring the efficient collection, treatment and analysis of data for their customers is therefore fast becoming a priority for Siteflow, too.",
            "More generally, it appears that data will play an increasingly critical role in the renewal of the nuclear energy sector, helping to produce new solutions and improve processes. This is a trend highlighted by Wolf: “Efficient and accurate records and documentation are important in the nuclear sector. We safely perform based on years and years of documented operation and maintenance experience. Digital tools that provide structured data management, can clearly help us to even better access and analyse our onsite service records and performance, in terms of safe, compliant and effective service delivery”.",
            "With more available data and developing technologies in a large number of areas – from nuclear plant design using 3D modelling and augmented reality, to the manufacturing of smart, connected components (IoT) to safer technical dismantling – comes the promise of a new smart industry. Hauvette believes that in the not-too-distant future industry workers will “likely function like today’s tech teams”; tackling objectives and goals in streamlined task forces, integrating digital tools in all of their processes and using automated technology to complete technical tasks. He is explicit in the scale of his ambitions, saying: “The digitalisation of the nuclear sector is really only in the starting blocks, we want Siteflow to become a leading pioneer of that digital transformation”.",
            "Amid growing demand and steep expectations for the nuclear industry, one thing is clear: digital technologies and solutions will play a crucial role if the sector is to realise its full promise."

            "Westinghouse Electric Company has filed a Notice of Intent to submit key licensing reports for its eVinci microreactor to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC). NRC and CNSC signed a Memorandum of Cooperation in 2019 to facilitate joint technical reviews of advanced nuclear technologies.",
            "The eVinci Microreactor is a next-generation, small battery for decentralised generation markets and micro grids such as remote communities, remote industrial mines, defence facilities and critical infrastructure. It is designed to provide competitive and resilient power and superior reliability with minimal maintenance, while its small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment. The reactor core is designed to run for three or more years, eliminating the need for frequent refuelling.",
            "The key benefits of eVinci are attributed to its solid core and advanced heat pipes. The heat pipes enable passive core heat extraction, allowing autonomous operation and inherent load following capabilities. This makes eVinci a pseudo “solid-state” reactor with minimal moving parts. It is designed to provide approximately 5 MWe for eight years without refuelling and will be factory built and assembled before being shipped in a container to any location.",
            "Westinghouse said the report topics for joint review include a common set of key requirements for the classification of systems, structures and components for the eVinci microreactor. This will enable deployment of a standard design in both the US and Canada. Other topics include defining the necessary transportation requirements for shipment of the microreactor across the border, and factory safety testing and inspection programmes.",
            "During 2022, the Westinghouse eVinci microreactor team submitted 24 technical white papers to NRC. The first two topical reports for formal NRC review were delivered ahead of schedule in December. The topical reports are created to gain early NRC approval on critical aspects of the technology and design.",

            "Each NPP comprises two 1,120 MWe Westinghouse four-loop pressurised water reactor units. The Braidwood units began commercial operation in 1988 and the Byron units in 1985 and 1987. The investment will increase output by approximately 135 MWe, the equivalent of adding 216 intermittent wind turbines to the grid, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. The project is expected to create work for thousands of skilled union workers during construction while expanding economic activity for surrounding businesses in the plant communities, Constellation said.",
            "Constellation, formerly Exelon Generation, owns and operates 21 nuclear reactors and also has an operating interest in Salem NPP units 1&2. Braidwood and Byron were among the Illinois NPPs that were saved from premature retirement by passage of the state Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021. Congress also passed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, which provides a base level of support for nuclear energy nationwide.",
            "Support for nuclear in the IRA has made extending the lives of U.S. nuclear assets to 80 years more likely assuming continued support. It has caused Constellation to examine nuclear uprate opportunities that were cancelled a decade ago due to market forces. Tax credit for the production of new carbon-free electricity helps to make these investments economic, Constellation noted.",

Unit 4 will begin commercial operation sometime between November 2023 and March 2024 rather than the end of 2023. The two units will be the first new US reactors in decades. Unit 3’s schedule depends on potential impacts arising from unit 4 testing activities that overlap with unit 3 start-up and commissioning, the utility said. The schedule also hinges on maintaining overall construction productivity and production levels, particularly in subcontractor scopes of work, and maintaining appropriate levels of craft labourers. “Any further delays could result in later in-service dates and cost increases,” it said.",

These included a slowly dripping valve that required that has since been repaired, as well as a problem involving the flow through the reactor coolant pumps that is still being investigated. This could be a physical issue, or one related to the calibration of flow measurements, he added. “We will continue to take the time to get it right and will not sacrifice safety or quality to meet the schedule,” he said in a conference call. Unit 3 reactor is now expected to achieve criticality, in March or April.",

            "In late April 2022 Finland's nuclear power plant operator Teollisuuden Voima Oy (TVO) began its regular annual outage at unit 1 of the Olkiluoto nuclear plant. Named after Olkiluoto island in western Finland, the plant has two operating 890MWe BWRs that were commissioned in 1978 and 1980 with commercial operations following on a year or two later. Collectively the units supply around a fifth of the country’s electricity demand. Designed and built by ASEA- Atom, now part of Westinghouse, the plant was returned to service in early June.",
            "‘Our normal strategy is that we have two kinds of outages,” explains Sauli Suoniemi, Maintenance Manager of OL1 And OL2. “A fuel outage takes place every year for one unit and service outage for another. For the fuel outage we change fuel and perform mandatory tests and some pre- maintenance. We also deal with those forward notifications which we must handle in an outage. In a service outage we make practically all pre-maintenance, all inspections and other modifications. Standard lengths for these outages are seven days for fuel outage and 14 days for service outage. Then every five or six years we do a longer service outage when we do bigger modifications like we did for example this year. For unit 1, this took 32 days and was extra-long for us,” he adds.",
            "The strategy sees TVO ‘save up’ various modifications over the previous two or three outages which can be undertaken during the longer outage. During the latest outage a whole range of preventive maintenance activities, inspections and modifications were carried out. The most significant work packages included, for example, the replacement of pumps and valves in the shutdown cooling system, renewal of electrical bushing assemblies in containment, inspection of the reactor pressure vessel bottom, maintenance activities in the service water channel and concreting one of the service water channels as well as replacement of impellers in feedwater pumps, installation of a new recirculation line and a pressure test of the reactor primary circuit.",
            "“We don’t typically need extra-long outages, we have a spread out pre-maintenance programme so that we can do all our free maintenance during a normal 14 day service outage. These extra-long outages are just for modification projects when we have to, for example, change our big primary circulation pumps and large valves. When the modification takes too long for the normal service outage then we make this extra-long service outage. Actually, practically the only maintenance-related work is our primary circuit pressure test as that is too long for a normal two-week outage. However, that’s just once in every eight years so these longer outages are just for big modification projects.",
            "Nuclear plants are typically very long-lived assets and given this longevity – OL1 and 2 have already been operating for well over 40 years – one issue that can demand modification and upgrading is the potential for key components to become obsolete. The original equipment manufacturers may even go bust or be taken over during the decades of operational lifespan. At a certain point it’s better to simply replace a unit for a more modern equivalent. This was behind a key upgrade during the latest outage in which saw a number of water circulation pumps replaced.",
            "As Suoniemi says: “These pumps which we did this year are from late 1970s and those were the original pumps. They worked fine and there were no problems from that perspective but it’s hard to get spare parts. Those are technically old pumps and that’s normally the primary reason to make these modifications. Of course, when we are changing to new components we check to see if we can get more efficient equipment and we normally do get more efficiency. We make these modifications also for the future, when we see that we are going to change some systems, let’s say in five years for example, then we have to make these additional modifications so that they are still valid when we do something else.”",
            "Although modernisation and replacement are one weapon in the armoury for TVO, it may also be the case that a stronger maintenance regime could be more economically advantageous. “Obsolescence is one point of concern when we make these decisions but it’s also vice versa.",
            "As with any normal asset management programme it’s a balancing act, you have to check to see if the maintenance costs are too big sometimes or if it’s cheaper to do more maintenance than to change a piece of equipment for a new one,” says Suoniemi, adding: “When we are planning or making decisions if we have to change some equipment then we also check if it’s more efficient to carry out more maintenance for example, a big overhaul project or something. We have done that also, for example, for large valves which can be intact but have a worn pivot bearing. Then we can carry out a major overhaul project to make the old existing equipment like new.”",
            "When looking to replace or upgrade a component though, it is becoming increasingly difficult to source appropriate components. “It is clear that nowadays in the nuclear business it’s not a buyer’s market. Sometimes it’s very hard to find suppliers which are willing to deal with our demands because we are kind of a small market and we have extra needs, so it’s not easy,” says Suoniemi, adding: “It’s not black and white but there is this phenomenon because even in Europe the situation has been affected by Fukushima, which added to the supply chain strain when some countries left the nuclear sector. That may change now we’re seeing a nuclear being reappraised in light of the climate issue.”",
            "Any part replacement programme must also tie in with the existing regulatory requirements to ensure that any modifications are qualified. “When we are dealing with the safety-related systems then all the equipment and any modifications must be qualified by our own officials. For reliability, if we are dealing with the safety-related systems, for example, in unit one and two we have four subsystems. Once you’ve found a piece of equipment that meets your specs then you trial it for quite a long time.",
            "We install one component in the equipment for one subsystem then we get operational experience and then when we are sure that it’s working well and we won’t have any surprises then we can roll it out on other three subsystems once it’s proven. It’s a potential nightmare if we install all four subsystems at the same time and then find there’s some surprises so we ensure reliability in this way,” notes Suoniemi.",
            "Using maintenance to improve efficiency While replacing components can prevent potential problems with obsolescence, the comprehensive maintenance programme put in place by TVO also allows the overall system to be improved over time. Upgrades support efficiency improvements by reducing parasitic loads from pump motors and the like. During the five-year modernisation outage TVO therefore assesses potential gains in plant output. Suoniemi explains: “Motors can be more efficient and the equipment can be more efficient so one point is that we check to see if we can make our own processes more effective in the modification process. If we can get more efficiency from our plant by putting in new equipment then it’s very important because we have to aim that we have a more efficient plant and that’s also wise in terms of economics if we can get more efficiency from our plant than we can get more with the same assets.”",
            "He cites a upgrade undertaken during the previous extended outage: “Five or six years ago we made a modification project and changed our main sea water condensers. The old ones were of a technical age where we thought we were at the end of their lifespan and we got more efficient main condensers and more net power out of our plant. Those new condensers will pay for themselves and also we changed our high pressure heat exchangers that also gave us a bit more net power.”",
            "Replacing the impellers for the feed water pumps is another modification that has improved efficiency but has also improved safety. “The old ones were wearing and so it was time to change them and we changed them more effective next-generation design ones from our OEM partner. Now we can get more from our feed water pumps and we don’t need so many pumps for normal running.",
            "We have four main feed water pumps and with these new impellers in all normal circumstances we can use just three of these pumps. We had a situation beforehand that we could drive the system with the three pumps but not in all circumstances. Now we can use tree pumps in every case,” says Suoniemi. This leaves a significant reserve capacity potentially but also represents a 25% reduction in main feed water pump power demand which in turn saves quite a substantial volume of power used in plant systems. “Beforehand if the one pump failed then it wasn’t possible to get the full power output from the plant. It not only improves the safety margin but also improves performance. From that perspective it’s a good move too,” he says.",
            "“This project is quite a good example where we had options to change the whole pumps or change just the impellers and there were other choices also. We made a decision that we would keep these old pumps and we overhauled some elements. Those pumps are driven using hydraulic clutches and we also made some optimizations for the clutches too as well as changed the impellers. We’re also going to make some erosion repairs to the pumps. This kind of project has many steps but afterwards we get almost like new pumps without changing the whole unit.”",
            "There has been an on-going process of improvement for the plant and follows on from projects such as the steam turbine replacement that took place some 17 years ago under the Turbine Island Modernisation project (TIMO). Timed to coincide with the annual outages in 2005-2006, this programme saw the replacement of the reheaters, low pressure turbines, steam dryers and the 6.6 kV switchgear as well as the modernization of turbine process automation in both plants. “When these projects were combined we got quite a lot more net power out from the plant,” says Suoniemi, who noted that while these major modernisations take place every five or 10 years the biggest modification process made during the latest outage were changes to the pumps.",
            "Alongside the modernisation of plant systems, TVO also works with its partners to develop novel tools to support its O&M and inspection programme. For this outage a special camera system that was developed to inspect the reactor pressure vessel of unit 1 was deployed, for example. “The vessel tree project is a materials-related project.",
            "When we took all the fuel out of the core during our primary circuit pressure test we had camera manipulators that we used to inspect the bottom of the vessel to see if there was any contamination or foreign bodies. This was the first time since the plant started up that we were able to inspect the whole bottom of the reactor vessel,” says Suoniemi.",
            "He adds: “We worked with a partner and supplier to develop the special equipment for that purpose based on monitor camera manipulators. We took part in that and it went very well. We developed that for unit two and after that we and they made some changes from the lessons learned and now it is an even better system. We have developed some special systems for maintenance but it’s in inspections that it is more useful when they use a lot of manipulators for inspection and not so much in maintenance.”",
            "Suoniemi continues: “Although there had been some damaged fuel removed from the unit 1 reactor the camera inspection wasn’t developed to find bits of fin or anything like that that had dropped through the fuel channels. Instead, it was for finding small components that had down to the bottom of the vessel, for example pins or little nuts and similar kinds of things. Practically we didn’t find anything, it was all clean.”",
            "Similar inspections are planned for the future, but TVO hasn’t decided when they are to be carried out. “Perhaps, for example, when we take all the fuel out from the core for the pressure test. That could be the window to do this but we’ll see we haven’t made any decisions,” says Suoniemi. The operators don’t normally change all of the fuel during an outage but change just around a fourth of it.",
            "Another aspect of modernization at Okiluoto is the use of modern data systems. More digitalization with embedded sensors forms part of the ongoing systems upgrading and modernization as is a part of this maintenance process:",
            "“I think that is one thing which is coming more and more because, of course, in an older plant like this we don’t have almost anything of that kind. All we have we built ourselves afterwards, for example the vibration monitoring systems and that kind of thing. But in the future the equipment will rely on these things much more. I’m sure that it will come also for the old plants that we have to get more this kind of data which we can use, for example, for maintenance planning. If we can get more data and info then we can make changes also with that knowledge. It’s coming and I’m positive about that,” says Suoniemi. He continues: “In our current maintenance and uprating programme we actually have a project for that. There is a lot of digitalisation and these kinds of sensors and sources of data and I think that we will learn a lot from unit 3. In the future we can also use this knowledge for units 1 and 2 to learn which things are important and where to put these kinds of assets to develop that knowledge base but we don’t right now routinely include that capability in new equipment that we install such as valves.”",
            "Although 14 days is a narrow window in which to execute a whole raft of different maintenance activities and special projects, TVO has a novel approach to its workflow management. “We have quite a unique system in how we handle these maintenance outages in which one maintenance engineer is in charge of a whole project, for example all the turbine island valves,” explains Suoniemi. “For an outage this single engineer will handle the whole pre-maintenance programme and plan all the outage works for their equipment. Then they will get the resources from vendors and partners to execute the works and during the outage is in charge of all these works. They are the field and project manager for maintenance works for, in this example, turbine island valves. We will have another maintenance engineer for the reactor island valves and another one for pumps, another one for instrumentation and so on. So, we have divided all of the plant equipment into small portions or sectors and each has its own maintenance engineer who is responsible. They plan all his own or her own works during the winter time and then, before the outage, does all the planning work preparation to make sure they get all the spare parts and all the resources and that they are all in the field during an outage,” says Suoniemi.",
            "He adds: “This is quite rare because we do all the maintenance planning and maintenance engineering in maintenance. In most plants the technical department does for example the pre-maintenance planning and this kind of things but in TVO we do it in maintenance, which is not just for execution it’s also for maintenance planning.”",
            "“It’s very effective when you have to make all the planning beforehand yourself, secure any necessary spare parts and keep up the whole pre-maintenance system and then are in charge in the field too. You learn a lot when you manage all your own equipment and then during the following outage next winter you may remember, for example, that a particular valve saw extra wear in a part. Now they have to take that information as it concerns the next outage and make a full report annually at the end of the year. It’s a very good system in terms of both maintenance needs and the outage efficiency needs,” he says.",
            "The various lead engineers also coordinate between each other to ensure a smooth workflow during the outage process. “Definitely they coordinate their works within operations and they know each other very well and it’s easy to make contact. We have a single organisation for both units 1 and 2 as they are more or less identical so the same individuals manage unit one and two with the same equipment and spares,” he says.",
            "This approach builds an in-depth knowledge base that is really important but builds efficiency between the two units where particular problems, such as accelerated ware of a particular valve that is likely to be seen in both units.",
            "“It’s quite motivational too when you are doing the planning as you keep up the pre-maintenance programme and the spare parts. Then you make all the planning and preparation during the winter months,” Suoniemi concludes.",
            "The outage period is also kept to a minimum by effecting repairs to non-operating components while spare inventory is put into service. “We do have a quite a lot of spare equipment for the units because, for example, if you have a major repair on a big valve it can take a very long time. Instead we change the whole insert of the valve then we have this insert which we have taken out and we can perform the necessary maintenance for that, for example, over the next winter in our hot works. Then we put it back to stores and use that as a replacement during the next outage or in a couple of years. This is one way we can get shorter outages when we have a changeable equipment or inserts and we can do the overhauls not in outage time but in online time,” Suoniemi notes.",
            "A perennial issue for the nuclear business to recruit new engineers to replace the depth of experience and knowledge that long-serving staff have. TVO has a personnel of about 1000 but there is inevitably a constant turnover of staff.",
            "“When I started back 20 years ago there were still those guys who actually built these plants back in the late 1970s and early 1980s. They were still on-line but there were a few years when they all then retired and we got a new generation. Of course, they didn’t have that kind of know- how of those people who actually built the plants. It went well but there were certain risks. In that situation it’s very important that we have good data systems that covers a lot of this operational experience. New engineers can go to the data system and check previous experience, for example noting there was the same kind of phenomena back in 1999 and at that time it was handled in this way,” Suoniemi explains, adding: “In these kinds of plants which are going to be in use for maybe 60 years or more it’s very important that we have this historical data and also the cultural heritage. That’s the foundation of an approach where we can start to make the decisions to make things more effective. When you don’t have this kind of foundation it’s very difficult to make any kind of change for the better.”",
            "TVO is also looking at uprating and digitizing these historical records so they can also be accessed and used more effectively.",
            "“We have started that process. Now we are pulling out key bits of the paper record and assessing its helpfulness for future maintenance and getting that digitised if required. We have a very good operational data, for example, for maintenance use from the early 1990s and then we have a project to develop more data systems but it’s very long-term because all the plant documents have been on paper originally, for example all the blueprints. We have quite a lot of data already for units one and two but there’s a long way to go before we’re going to have everything.”",
            "Throughout its existence, TVO has worked to acquire nuclear competence by uprating Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto L2 and modernising the plants. Over that last four decades these modernisation projects have improved the safety, production capacity and economy of the power plant units and pave the way not only for an expended lifespan but also realiability of operations. Since the early 1990s both units have had capacity factors of well above 90% for example. The latest annual outage for OL1 and OL2 consisted of refuelling and various annual preventive maintenance activities, inspections, repairs and tests and the plant was returned to service in June."

Government-owned Industria, as part of the Industrial Development Agency (IDA) Group, is leading efforts to develop a supply chain of parts and modules for SMR production. As a leader of Central Hydrogen Cluster, Industria aims to deploy up to three SMRs to produce 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen every year. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is a 470 MWe small pressurised water reactor, which the company aims to launch in the UK by 2030.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson said Poland is a key international market for its factory-built SMR. “This is an important step in our relationship with Industria, he said. It sets out “the basis on which we’ll work together to develop joint plans for using our SMR technology in Poland to decarbonise energy intensive industry and produce clean power for generations to come”.",
            "Poland and the wider region are seeking to decarbonise, while bolstering their energy security, Rolls-Royce SMR noted. It added that its factory-built power solution is perfectly sized to connect to the electricity grid or for off-grid industrial use such as hydrogen production. There are also future opportunities to replace more than 8GW of coal-fired power plants in southern Poland with SMRs throughout the 2030s.",

            "Through the Central Hydrogen Cluster, “we cooperate with companies from our region as well as from three hydrogen valleys: Lower Silesia, Silesia-Lesser Poland and Subcarpathian”. He added that the initiative has the support of IDA Group with the aim of creating jobs and securing Polish industry’s strong participation in the SMR industry of the future. “Plans for deployment of Rolls-Royce SMR power plants in central and southern Poland will help meet these goals in the 2030s.”",
            "IDA Board President Cezariusz Lesisz said cooperation with Rolls-Royce SMR is a great opportunity to develop a high-tech industrial base for small scale nuclear power in Poland. “Building new competencies of Polish industry is part of a trend of focusing on energy transition and strengthening our country’s energy security and resilience.”",

            "Czech power company ČEZ expects to invest more than CZK2.3bn ($104m) in the Dukovany NPP in 2023, almost CZK500m more than last year. The investments are primarily aimed at ensuring the plant can continue to operate until at least 2047. Dukovany is also switching to 16-month fuel campaigns for all four units and plans to recruit about 100 new employees.",
            "The Czech Republic has six commercially operational reactor units: four Russian designed VVER-440 units at Dukovany site, which began operation between 1985 and 1987, and two VVER-1000 units at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. Total installed nuclear capacity is 3934 MWe accounting for 32.5% of electricity generation.",
            "The modernisation of Dukovany will include the restoration and upgrading of both production and non-production equipment. \"The investments are aimed at ensuring the safe operation of Dukovany for at least 60 years, even at the cost of more work this year,” says Bohdan Zronek, member of the ČEZ Board of directors and Director of the nuclear power division.",
            "The increased work this year will also mean longer outages. According Dukovany NPP Director Roman Havlin, the most time-consuming and technically demanding project is a project for cleaning steam generators. \"Last year, in collaboration with our colleagues from Framatome, we were the first in the world to develop and test a cleaning method that can remove mineral deposits inside the equipment and thus ensure their expected service life,\" Dukovany has 24 of these steam generators, most of which will undergo cleaning in the coming years.",
            "The four units are also gradually switching from the original 12-month fuel campaigns to 16-months This will significantly increase their efficiency of both operation and maintenance, ČEZ notes.",
            "Zronek told journalists that extended fuel cycles were becoming standard. \"Most of the world's power plants operate in 18-month cycles, some even longer,\" he said.",
            "The longer fuel campaigns will use new PK3 + fuel supplied by Russia’s TVEL. The fuel was delivered to the site last year the plant already has already applied to the State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB) for a licence to use it. The RK 3+ design has enhanced physical and thermo-hydraulic properties compared with previous generations of VVER-440 fuel. It has a longer fuel rod pitch that streamlines the water-uranium ratio in the reactor core and increases the efficiency of the fuel.",
            "Dukovany has been using TVEL’s fuel for 40 years and currently has fuel reserves for at least three years. However, under pressure from the EU and the US, and especially in the wake of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, the Czech Republic is looking to diversity its fuel suppliers. From 2024 US-based Westinghouse and France’s Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin NPP. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel.",
            "\"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know,\" Havlín explained. SÚJB chairwoman Dana Drábová said last year that she did not expect it would be necessary to change fuel suppliers for the roughly 20 years of operation that remained for the Dukovany plant. She noted that TVEL produces fuel of excellent parameters. \"CEZ will have to come to terms with the fact that the fuel from the new supplier will not be optimised for performance, as was the case with the fuel from TVEL.\"",
            "Nevertheless, a decision to secure fuel supplies from companies other than Russia’s TVEL for Dukovany is expected. \"I can't imagine being dependent on just one supplier in the future. Some negotiations are underway, I can't say the details yet,\" noted Havlín.",

            "Ukraine’s Cabinet of Ministers has given the green light for work to begin to develop project documentation for the construction of two Westinghouse AP1000 reactors at the Khmelnitsky NPP. Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko said Ukraine was starting to develop technical documentation for the new type of reactor. “In other words, we have ended the era of the creation of nuclear energy based on Soviet technology.\" The target date to complete construction and start-up of units is 2030-2032, subject to the impact of the military hostilities. The estimated cost of each unit at about $5bn. He said work can now start on a technical and economic feasibility study.",
            "Petro Kotin, President of Ukraine's nuclear utility Energoatom, said construction of АР1000 power units opens the way to “continue the implementation of modern technologies, strengthen our energy front and accelerate the reorientation of Ukrainian energy to Western standards”.",
            "Ukraine currently is in control of three of four NPPs with a total of 15 Soviet designed reactors – South Ukraine (three VVER-1000s); Rivne (two VVER-1000s and two VVER-440s); and Khmelnitsky (two VVER-1000s and two more partly completed units). The Zaporizhia NPP, with six VVER-1000s, has been under Russia’s control since March 2022.",
            "In August it was announced that Energoatom had selected Westinghouse AP1000 technology for its long-term goals to develop new NPPs in Ukraine. A memorandum of understanding was signed for five new units including two at Khmelnitsky and one unit each at Rivne, South Ukraine and Zaporizhia as well as two others at a new site – Orbita in Chigrin. This had previously been considered for a new NPP during Soviet times. Kotin said Ukraine was aiming for four new units at two new sites between 2032-2040.",
            "The following November the first two agreements was signed on the construction of the two units at the Khmelnisky NPP. They would not be constructed at the site of the partly built units 3&4 but at a new site in the station territory. In June 2022, Energoatom and Westinghouse agreed to increase the number of new units with AP1000 reactors from five to nine with support from a planned Westinghouse Engineering Centre in Ukraine. As yet no work has started.",

            "Slovenia's Environmental Protection & Spatial Planning has issued a permit to extend the operating life of the Krsko NPP until 2043. The Krsko plant is co-owned by Croatia’s Hrvatska elektroprivreda (HEP) and Slovenia's GEN Energija. Krsko NPP, located in Slovenia near the border with Croatia, generates some 40% of Slovenia's electricity output. The 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor, which is some 100 kilometres from the Austrian border, is Slovenia's only NPP.",
            "The Krsko plant, which was put into operation in 1983, produces an average of 5.6 TWh of electricity a year, divided equally between Croatia and Slovenia. The plant annually covers about 20% of Slovenia's and about 16% of Croatia's needs for electricity.",
            "HEP said decision \"has strategic importance, both for the Croatian Electric Industry, as a 50 percent co-owner of NEK, and for the entire Croatian energy sector, from an economic, energy and environmental aspect, especially in the circumstances of the current energy crisis.\"",
            "The process for obtaining environmental consent was long and highly complex. The application had been submitted to the ministry in October 2021. Several scientific institutions from Croatia and Slovenia participated in the preparation of documentation, analysis, and expert evaluations, as well as the preparation of an environmental impact assessment (EIA). Environment minister Uros Brezan said in a statement that the permit also addressed resistance to climate change and external factors, as well as the issue of warming watercourses. Since the plant is located in an earthquake zone, an emphasis was also placed on earthquake safety.",
            "The final permit ran to 300 pages. Some 50 experts participated in the environmental assessment and the resulting action plan will be finalised by mid-2023, according to Stanislav Rozman, President of the management board of plant operator, Nuklearna Elektrarna Krsko (NEK). An international working group involving some 30 countries based on the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in Transboundary Context drew up the instructions for conducting the EIA.",
            "A cross-border environmental impact assessment was also carried out with the neighbouring countries of Croatia, Italy, Hungary and Austria as well as Germany, and delegations from Italy and Austria made an additional visit to the plant, the government said. In July 2021, the infrastructure ministry issued an energy permit for the construction of a second reactor unit at Krsko, but the decision was opposed by Austria. Slovenia is preparing for a referendum on the issue.",
            "Infrastructure minister Bojan Kumer said in a statement that the use of nuclear energy, in view of the current energy crisis, “is an important topic for the future generations of our country, which is why we in the current government have undertaken to thoroughly examine it, taking into account the opinion of the citizens”.",
            "Rozman said the plant will need no physical technological upgrades and NEK expects to complete the installation of a facility for dry storage of used nuclear fuel by the middle of this year. This will fulfil all the conditions and all decisions set by the authorities for extending operation of the plant. After the upgrades, the plant will meet the criteria defined by the EU taxonomy for the long-term operation of NPPs. This year, a third periodic safety inspection will be completed at the plant in which the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration will check whether it can operate safely for the next ten years.",
            "In November, NEK completed a planned maintenance of the power plant, which involved replacing 56 of the 121 fuel elements and an extensive standard maintenance and checking programme for mechanical, electrical and instrumentation equipment. The plant was originally designed to operate until 2023. In 2016, however, GEN Energija and HEP decided to extend its lifespan by 20 years until 2043, provided the plant undergoes a security check every 10 years.",

Under this agreement, which entered into force on 1 December, the two companies will collaborate exclusively in the manufacture of VVER-440 fuel for the countries that currently operate this type of reactor. Enusa has launched all the necessary activities to reinstall a production line for this product at its Juzbado factory. This is expected to be completed and licensed in 2023 to make possible fuel deliveries from the beginning of 2024.",
            "Through this agreement, Westinghouse and Enusa will manufacture the fuel using their factories at Västerås, in Sweden, and Juzbado (Salamanca), in Spain, as supply contracts are signed. Enusa says the agreement has a special impact on manufacturing activities and opens the door to collaboration in engineering and licensing activities as well as in service activities at power plants. These will be finalised based on the contracts that are formalized with the different clients.",
            "In September, Westinghouse and Enusa announced their intention to",
            "collaborate on VVER-440 fuel fabrication",
            "with the aim of delivering a Western alternative to Russian fuel in the European market VVER-440s currently use fuel from Rosatom’s TVEL.",
            "Westinghouse and Enusa have partnered since 1974 under a Pressurised-Water Reactor (PWR) fuel technology transfer agreement supporting plants in Spain, Belgium, and France among others. In 1999, British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) bought Westinghouse’s commercial nuclear power businesses. Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to Fortum’s Loviisa NPP in Finland, which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain.",
            "The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies at Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "These designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006 when Westinghouse was purchased by Toshiba. However, the Loviisa fuel contract was not renewed and Westinghouse withdrew from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "In 2014 reactivation of the VVER-440 market was reconsidered and Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe. It was granted €2 million in 2015 to run the European Supply of Safe Nuclear Fuel (ESSANUF) HORIZON 2020 project. Both Enusa and Westinghouse worked together on the ESSANUF project in 2015-2017.",

            "Bulgaria's parliament has mandated the caretaker government to begin talks with the USA on a potential agreement for the construction of two additional reactors at the Kozloduy NPP using Westinghouse AP-1000 technology. The decision was passed by 112 votes to 45 with 39 abstentions in the 240-seat National Assembly.",
            "The parliament requested the energy minister take all necessary steps by 1 March to start a process facilitating the construction of a new unit (7) at the Kozloduy NPP. The cabinet must also proceed with preparations for obtaining a licence and environmental impact assessment for the construction of an identical unit (8) at Kozloduy, although no timeline was stipulated.",
            "Currently, Bulgaria is facing a political stalemate after four elections in two years failed to produce a permanent government. One of the parties which opposed the motion was the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which was subsequently asked by the president to try to put together a big enough coalition to form a government, after two other parties failed to do so. BSP’s Rumen Gechev said his parliamentary group did not oppose the new reactors at Kozloduy, but voted against because they believed the construction of Belene NPP should be completed first.",
            "The Belene project in northern Bulgaria was to comprise two Russian VVER-1000 reactors, and initial site works began in 2008 when the BSP was in power. Contracts for components including large forgings and I&C systems were signed with suppliers, but the project faced financial problems and loss of political support when the BSP was voted out in 2009. The project was suspended in 2012. In 2019, the government advertised for a strategic investor for a project to build two large reactors, but said that neither funding guarantees nor long-term electricity sales contracts would be offered. Bulgaria had to pay compensation to Rosatom for the two reactors which had already been manufactured and delivered.",
            "In January 2021 the Bulgarian government approved plans for Kozloduy 7, and held talks with Westinghouse about making maximum use of the Russian-supplied equipment already purchased for Belene.",
            "However, after lengthy and complex negotiations, the AP-1000 technology was deemed the most suitable, according to the decision published on the parliament's website.",
            "Currently, the Bulgarian nuclear power plant operates two Soviet-built VVER-1000 reactors (units 5&6). Bulgaria was obliged to close four older VVER-440 units as a condition for accession to the European Union, even though the units had undergone significant safety upgrades.",
            "Earlier this month, Bulgaria, which is under pressure to reduce its energy dependency on Russia, signed an agreement with France's Framatome to receive fresh nuclear fuel for unit 6 between 2025 and 2034 following a similar agreement with Westinghouse Electric in December for nuclear fuel for unit 5. Fuel is currently supplied by Russia’s TVEL.",
            "The Council of Ministers has now approved a strategic vision for the development of the power sector for 2023-2053. The document focuses on several key priorities. First and foremost, Bulgaria must remain a regional leader in electricity production and export. The protection of national and energy security, as well as the sustainable use of local energy sources, are also top priorities, as well as a transition to decarbonisation for the coal regions and protection against energy poverty.",
            "The document envisages the use of indigenous lignite resources until 2030 and its gradual reduction and phase-out by 2038. This will help to maintain energy and national security, as well as the country's role as a regional leader in electricity production and export. In the nuclear power sector the strategy provides for construction of four reactors which will replace those due for decommissioning. It specifies that two reactors are to be built at the Kozloduy site and two more at Belene.",
            "Caretaker Energy Minister Rossen Hristov has said that Bulgaria should aim to have 4,000 MWe of nuclear capacity, and to this end it should negotiate with all leading companies such as Westinghouse, Framatome and EDF and not just the USA.",

        "text": [
            "Above: Springfields in the UK has a long nuclear history and its fortunes could be revived once again by market changes in the front end fuel cycle",
            "There is no better illustration of how global events are causing structural change in the nuclear fuel supply chain than the UK’s venerable Springfields site.",
            "A gaseous diffusion enrichment plant at the site dating back to the cold war era disappeared decades ago, replaced by a business park. Fuel fabrication is still carried out at the site for the UK’s dwindling fleet of AGRs, but other areas of the site have been in a care and maintenance regime, with decommissioning in prospect. However, in December the UK government announced it would provide investment of up to £13mn for Westinghouse’s Springfields nuclear fuel fabrication operation, to help the company develop the capability to convert reprocessed uranium and freshly mined uranium to make new fuel. The Springfield site may also be required by Cameco to help fill growing gaps in the fuel supply market – conversion and enrichment, and fuel for Russian-supplied VVER reactors. Among the facilities in care and maintenance Springfields has a conversion capacity that closed in 2014, but its owner Westinghouse itself has a new owner in Cameco and that company has already said that more conversion capacity will be needed and that could include a further Springfield revival.",
            "Meanwhile, two other organisations at the site won government funding in September for engineering studies to help produce new types of fuel for advanced reactors.",
            "National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) will work with JAEA and Urenco to deliver a domestic commercial fuel supply, starting with the first fuel load, for a High Temperature Gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) demonstration project. They will collectively develop the necessary coated particle fuel to full scale commercialisation, with a view to supplying markets worldwide. In a separate project Springfields Fuels Ltd will join with Urenco to commercialise TRISO as the standard fuel type for contemporary HTGR designs.",
            "In contrast with much of Springfields’ history, the new fuel opportunities are in a competitive environment. The UK faces competition from the USA, where government funding (via Idaho National Laboratory) recently saw an award of $37mn to BWX Technologies to support the company in manufacturing Triso fuel at its Lynchburg facility in Virginia, using downblended government stockpiles of high-enriched uranium. The fuel would be used in microreactors designed to be transported in standard shipping containers and would be used in remote areas, as well as by the US military and in disaster response and recovery. “This commercial TRISO fuel production line is the culmination of more than 15 years of work at INL and other DOE national laboratories, in partnership with BWXT, to develop and qualify this fuel with immense potential for use in microreactors, space reactors and other advanced reactor concepts,” said INL Laboratory Director John Wagner.",
            "Supplying new reactor types and replacing Russian supply were two of the major issues identified by Grant Isaac, CFO at Cameco, as affecting a nuclear fuel market that he said is undergoing a transition as more supplies are needed to meet growing needs.",
            "Isaac said in a recent market update that geopolitical events – driven by need to exclude Russia from the supply chain – had raised interest in the enrichment and conversion processes.",
            "Discussing uranium supplies, he said, so far change had been driven by the need to secure fuel supplies, rather than by rising demand. But that is changing. Utilities were still buying on a ‘replacement’ basis, rather than contracting ahead for the long term – but the market was nevertheless becoming more favourable because the price was rising. He said, “We have never started a contracting cycle from this high a price”. Isaac added that there was “uncovered demand of 1.5 billion pounds between now and 2035”. New contracts were not reducing that uncovered demand “because demand is rising”. He highlighted forecasts that suggested demand would be 225M lb/ yr and said the gap “means we need to have the equivalent of three more Cigar Lakes” added to existing operations.",
            "Breaking down the uranium market demand in the coming period, Isaac said the geopolitical situation is “an accelerant on a fundamentally improving story”, because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the clean energy crisis.",
            "He identified four growth trends. First, reactor shutdowns had been halted or delayed. He said that a dozen units had been ‘saved’ in the last couple of years that would add 6M lb of demand over the coming three years. His second trend was life extension – typically adding 20 years to a plant lifetime, to reach 60 years, but in some cases anticipating further extension to 80 years. Ten announced life extensions would add demand of 100M lb in the medium term. Third, Isaac talked about new markets for western-supplied uranium and fuel. That market – central and Eastern Europe – had not been accessible to western suppliers and with a 15M lb market it was a “pretty material contribution”. Finally, Isaac said the “enormous prize” was new build. If the market for SMRs took off as the DoE indicates, it could see 300 modular reactors built over the next two decades and that would double US uranium requirements to 90M lb per year.",
            "The world’s largest uranium supplier, Kazatomprom, also has an expectation of increased uranium requirements. It highlighted Japanese plans to restart seven nuclear reactors, adding them to 10 reactors that have already received operating approval. Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) also plans to extend the current maximum 60-year operating life limitation for the nation’s reactors.",
            "Kazatomprom also noted new reactor startups in China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Turkey. Kazatomprom also highlighted financial support for SMRs and AMRs and particularly the recent US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which includes incentives for building nuclear facilities.",
            "Isaac described the emerging fuel cycle market as one leveraged by geopolitics and a world “where origins matter” – which could give additional value to western supplies.",
            "It is also a market with new actors. One such is specialist commodity company Yellowcake, whose purpose is “to exploit commercial opportunities in the uranium sector, including the purchase and holding of physical uranium for the long term”. In a trading update for the six months to 30 September Yellow Cake said it had increased its uranium holding from 15.83M lb of U3O8 to 18.81M lb of U3O8. It took advantage of a decrease in the spot price from USD57.90/lb to USD48.25/lb during the period.",
            "Chief executive Andre Liebenberg, said: “The case for buying and holding uranium, despite a much weaker economic outlook, is compelling. The underlying fundamentals for nuclear energy, particularly with recent events highlighting the need for greater energy security, continue to strengthen. We are seeing an acceleration of new nuclear build intentions, particularly from China and a broader-based appreciation of the value of the existing nuclear fleet infrastructure, with life extensions in the US and Europe and further restarts in Japan. Meanwhile, supply is still heavily constrained driven by supply side pressures and cost inflation and will not keep up with rising demand.”",
            "Yellowcake is not the only commodity trader with a new interest in the uranium market, but as a mining company with physical assets to manage Cameco’s market view is more complex. If it is to grow, it needs long-term contracts that will allow it to take the capital-intensive step of opening or reopening facilities. Grant Isaac sees the market heading in that direction and indications include a change in contracting behaviour from customers. There was “a restoration of classic long term contracting behaviour,” he said, with tenders increasing in volume and term as utilities have become more confident in the future of their fleets.",
            "Isaac said Cameco was also getting more market-related pricing in its contracts, allowing it to benefit from a rising market in the long term. The market had already moved from contracts with a floor price of $25-30 and ceiling of $45-50, to floors at $45-50 and a ceiling of $70-80 “more the norm”. He said the terms were not attractive enough to see the company look at greenfield sources but could consider revival at sites that are already built and permitted. It is not there yet, Isaac said, but “this market has legs”.",
            "Cameco’s headline activity is uranium mining but it recently took ownership of almost half of Westinghouse, joining Brookfield, which had been sole owner and has retained 51% of the company. Isaac said Cameco saw Westinghouse’s front-end business as complementary to its own, but also: “Westinghouse has scarce assets, mission-critical assets that are growing in importance” and it delivers mission- critical services. He said Cameco would have liked to take a larger stake, but “We were able to get 49% from a company that would have liked to retain more of it”.",
            "Assuming the acquisition gets all the necessary approvals, Westinghouse will be co-managed by the new partnership, he said.",
            "Isaac said Cameco had “always been invested in the fuel cycle”. It also has a conversion plant at Hope River in Canada and Cameco has identified conversion as a bottleneck in the fuel supply chain, especially as Russia’s capacity at Seversk becomes politically unusable for western companies. “That was underappreciated,” said Isaac, and he noted that ‘overfeeding’ existing enrichment plants was an additional factor driving up uranium demand.",
            "ConverDyn is expected to reopen its US Honeywell plant in Metropolis in 2023 but Isaac said the Westinghouse JV would allow it to bring light water reactor expertise to the Canadian plant and compete with the US supplier. It may also spark a revival in the UK. Cameco’s links with Springfields go back to 2005, when it sold conversion from the site as a tolling product for 10 years. That ended in 2014 but Isaac said, “You need the Honeywell [ConverDyn] conversion capacity back in the US, you probably need the Springfields capacity back in the UK to meet western demand”. Isaac said “we have a lot of conversion demand coming our way”. For Cameco, fuel cycle interests enhance the company’s uranium market exposure: “we can take unique conversion demand and pull into it uranium demand in a way a uranium-only producer would not be able to do. We are in the business of selling uranium and conversion under long term contracts. This is a powerful value driver for Cameco’s owners,” said Isaac. However, as with uranium supply, investment in conversion depends on a long-term order book.",
            "Isaac said Cameco was taking on debt but uranium production was expanding, starting with restart of Macarthur River. That would pay back quickly, he noted, because the active site would see a reduction in care and maintenance costs as well as income from ore production. At the front end of the nuclear fuel cycle, according to Cameco, “the pie is growing”.",

At that time, the two 1,117MWe Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were expected to cost about $14bn and to enter service in 2016 and 2017. Construction of Vogtle 3 began in March 2013 and unit 4 the following November.",
            "Analysts estimate total costs, including financing, have now increased to more than $30bn following delays related to the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, the 2017 bankruptcy of former contractor Westinghouse, and the coronavirus pandemic. NRC’s approval to begin fuel loading in October 2022 had been delayed because much of the reactor's wiring had to be redone after federal regulators found major flaws. Southern Co also fell behind on inspection documents that had to be completed before the NRC could sign off.",
            "Extending the in-service date for unit 3 beyond the first quarter of this year \"is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $15m pretax per month, as well as the related allowance for funds used during construction and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs,\" the company said.",

        "text": [
            "Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and parent company Korea Electric Power Corp (Kepco) are reportedly in discussion with US-based Westinghouse Electric Company on possibly sharing profits from South Korean nuclear reactor exports following a legal dispute which arose when the two were competing for a new build contract in Poland.",
            "KHNP had reportedly offered to build six APR1400 reactors with a capacity of 8.4GWe for $26.7 billion. The Westinghouse offer was $31.3 billion for six AP1000 reactors with a total capacity of 6.7GWe, while EDF’s bid for its EPR technology was for $33-48.5 billion for four to six reactors. Polish media reported that KHNP had also proposed post-construction technology transfer to Poland and media speculation was that the contract would go to KHNP.",
            "This prompted Westinghouse on 21 October to",
            "against KHNP and Kepco in a US federal court to block them from selling reactors to Poland. Westinghouse said KHNP’s reactor design included intellectual property licensed by Westinghouse and required permission from Westinghouse before being transferred to Poland or any other countries considering deploying the APR1400 reactor. In a separate suit, it urged the South Korean government to draw up measures to address such issues.",
            "However, KHNP said it had gained competence in the design, production and construction of NPPs in order to finally develop its own, independent technology. \"Korean nuclear technology is independent of Westinghouse technology and can be exported without restrictions and without the consent of the US,\" it noted. In response, KHNP lodged lawsuits in the US to force Westinghouse to drop the case and also sought to go to arbitration.",
            "In 2009, South Korea had secured a nuclear reactor order from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for $18.6 billion, under which it agreed to build four nuclear power plants based on the South Korean model. All four have been built on time and on budget. South Korea was invited by Saudi Arabia in 2022 to participate in its nuclear reactor tender. The South Korean government was hoping to export at least 10 nuclear reactors by 2030 and also took part in a tender in the Czech Republic. KHNP is also in discussions with Uganda and Ghana about possible nuclear construction projects.",
            "Discussions with Westinghouse are now focusing on splitting the profits in a given ratio, and clarifying how the Korean power utilities will pay royalties to Westinghouse in relation to any overseas nuclear plant orders Korea may receive.",
            "South Korea had developed the APR1400 model based on nuclear technology from Combustion Engineering, a US-based company, the nuclear business of which was sold to Westinghouse in 2000. This could mean that any country to which South Korea exports nuclear reactors may need approval from the US executive body and Congress. However, KHNP insist that it is only the US Federal government, not Westinghouse, that is authorised to take legal action based on the US nuclear energy laws.",
            "According to Reuters, industry observers have expressed concern about the negotiations warning that if South Korea gives in to Westinghouse’s demands it will cede too much control. “The discussion with Westinghouse will make or break South Korea’s nuclear power industry,” said one of the industry sources. “We have to find a compromise under the principle of reciprocity that will not hurt our national interests.”"

            "Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant. (Credit: Michael Barera/Wikipedia)",
            "Vistra Operations Company, the operator of Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in Texas, has sought renewed operating licences for Comanche Peak 1 and 2. The company – acting both on its own behalf and on behalf of the plant owner, Comanche Peak Power Company – has submitted a formal application for licences that would add an additional 20 years to the plant lifetimes, bringing them up to 60 years each.",
            "The existing licences for unit 1 and unit 2 expire on 8 February 2030 and 2 February 2033, respectively. The application for licence renewal – which requires no physical plant alterations or modifications – was submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in October and was recently made public.",
            "Comanche Peak 1 and 2 are sited 65 miles (108 km) southwest of Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas. Each unit is based on a four-loop Westinghouse Electric nuclear steam supply system. They are among the youngest of the USA’s fleet of nuclear stations – commercial operation began at Unit 1 on 13 August 1990 and Unit 2 on 3 August 1993. They were followed by Watts Bar 1 and 2. Each reactor was initially operated at a rated thermal power of 3411 MWt, but by 2008, the two units were each producing 3612 MWt after a series of upratings. As a consequence, electricity output has also been increasing; Unit 1 was uprated in autumn 2008 from 1,210 MWe to 1,259 MWe and Unit 2 was uprated in autumn 2009 from 1,208 MWe to 1,245 MWe.",
            "At that time it was thought that additional units could potentially be built at the site. Vistra subsidiary Luminant formed a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for this purpose and in 2008 they jointly applied for a combined construction and operating licence from NRC, planning to build two 1,700 MW advanced PWRs of a Mitsubishi design. However, that application was suspended in 2013 when falling gas prices and the build out of wind in Texas hollowed out the financial case for expansion at the site. Meanwhile MHI shifted its focus to restarting its Japanese reactors following the Fukushima event. The application has not, however, been withdrawn although Vistra’s focus is now on gaining a new and substantially longer licence for the existing plant.",
            "Preparing for the period of extended operation",
            "In order to prepare for the licence renewal application, the plant operator carried out a scoping and screening process to define which systems and structures were relevant for the renewed licence. These systems and structures were grouped into the following areas:",
            "Reactor vessel, internals and reactor coolant system",
            "Engineered safety features",
            "Steam and power conversion systems",
            "Containments, structures and component supports",
            "Electrical, instrumentation and control systems",
            "Typical aging effects that require management in these groups of components are cracking, cumulative fatigue damage, change in dimension, loss of fracture toughness, loss of material, reduction of heat transfer or wall thinning.",
            "There are several general safety issues currently under scrutiny by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and designated as ‘active or unresolved’. Four of these that may apply to the units at Comanche Peak are as follows:",
            "‘Multiple steam generator tube leakage’ has been incorporated into the steam generator programme. It covers inspection requirements for steam generator tubes.",
            "‘Fatigue evaluation of metal components for 60-year plant life’, concluded that licensees should address the effects of reactor coolant environment on component fatigue life as aging management programmes are formulated in support of licence renewal.",
            "‘Assessment of debris accumulation on PWR sump performance’ addresses the potential for blockage of containment sump strainers that filter debris from cooling water supplied to the safety injection and containment spray pumps following a postulated loss of coolant accident. The issue is based on the identification of new potential sources of debris, including failed containment coatings, which may block the sump strainers.",
            "‘Boral degradation’ addresses the potential for spent fuel racks that use Boral for neutron absorption experiencing problems with swelling and degradation of the plates over long periods of time.",
            "Aging management programmes",
            "Plant safety and efficiency are managed via a series of aging management programmes (AMPs) focused on specific components or systems. There are four types of aging maintenance programmes:",
            "Prevention programmes that stop the effects from occurring",
            "Mitigation programmes that slow the effects of aging",
            "Condition monitoring programmes that examine the presence and extent of aging",
            "Performance monitoring programmes that test the ability of a structure or component to perform its intended function.",
            "In preparing for any licence renewal application, existing programmes and activities that apply to systems, structures, components, or commodity groups are reviewed because they are often based on a regulatory commitment or requirement, rather than specifically designed for aging management.",
            "At Comanche Peak the renewal application says that many of these programmes had the required attributes and adequately manage aging effects. However, the plant operator will introduce several new ageing management programmes for the purposes of licence renewal. They are:",
            "Thermal aging embrittlement of cast austenitic stainless steel (CASS). This includes a screening methodology to determine component susceptibility to thermal aging embrittlement based on casting method, molybdenum content and ferrite percentage. For “potentially susceptible” components, thermal aging embrittlement management is accomplished through plant-specific flaw tolerance evaluations. Inspections or evaluations are not required for components that are determined not to be susceptible to thermal aging embrittlement. Three reactor coolant loop components are susceptible to thermal aging embrittlement in Unit 1 – a crossover leg 40-degree elbow, a crossover leg 90-degree elbow, and a crossover 90-degree elbow with plenum. A plant-specific flaw evaluation using plant-specific geometry and stress information was completed for all three of the components and it was determined that even with thermal aging, the susceptible CASS components are flaw tolerant for 60 years of service.",
            "PWR vessel internals. The new aging management plan is used to manage the effects of age-related degradation mechanisms that are applicable to reactor vessel internal components. These degradation mechanisms include: cracking due to stress corrosion and fatigue or cyclic loading; loss of material induced by wear; loss of fracture toughness due to thermal aging and neutron irradiation embrittlement; change in dimension due to void swelling or distortion; and loss of preload due to thermal and irradiation-enhanced stress relaxation and creep.",
            "One-time inspection will verify the system-wide effectiveness of the existing water chemistry, fuel oil chemistry and lubricating oil analysis AMPs. It will inspect a representative sample of components, which is 20% of the population, and if possible it will include components most susceptible to aging, due to their time in-service or the severity of operating conditions at their location.",
            "Selective leaching requires one-time inspections to demonstrate the absence of selective leaching. As above, it will be applied to a representative sample of susceptible components such as piping, valve bodies, pump casings, heat exchanger components and bolting. The materials of construction for these components that are susceptible to selective leaching are grey cast iron, ductile iron and copper alloy with greater than 15% zinc or 8% aluminium. The inspection of 20% of susceptible components will include visual examinations, supplemented by hardness tests or other mechanical examination techniques such as destructive testing, scraping, or chipping of selected components.",
            "One-time inspection of small-bore piping and inspection of internal surfaces in miscellaneous piping and ducting components. This AMP will incorporate volumetric inspections of a sample of this Class 1 piping focused on full and partial penetration welds. It will include measures to verify that degradation is not occurring, thereby either confirming that there is no need to manage age-related degradation or validating the effectiveness of any existing AMP for the period of extended operation.",
            "Internal surfaces in miscellaneous piping and ducting components. This AMP will manage loss of material, cracking, hardening and loss of strength and reduction of heat transfer using representative sampling and opportunistic visual inspections of the internal surfaces of metallic and elastomeric (including polymeric) components.",
            "Accessible power cables will be visually inspected for cable and connection jacket surface anomalies such as embrittlement, discoloration, cracking, melting, swelling or surface contamination that could indicate electrical insulation degradation. The first inspection for licence renewal will be completed prior to the period of extended operation and there will be recurring inspections performed at least once every 10 years thereafter.",
            "Internal portions of metal enclosed buses (bus enclosure assemblies) will be inspected for cracks, corrosion, foreign debris, excessive dust build-up and evidence of water intrusion. The bus electrical insulation material will be inspected for signs of reduced insulation resistance, radiation induced oxidation, moisture or debris intrusion or ohmic heating, as indicated by embrittlement, cracking, chipping, melting, discolouration or swelling.",
            "Absorbing operational experience",
            "A key process to manage aging effects in nuclear power plants is to make use of operational experience at the power plant and across the industry.",
            "Operational experience is used at Comanche Peak to enhance existing programmes, prevent repeat events and prevent events that have occurred at other plants. To achieve this, plant personnel screen, evaluate and act on documents and information from outside sources to prevent or mitigate the consequences of similar events. The operator draws on external sources including Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) and NRC documents. Relevant foreign and domestic research and development programmes are also reviewed. Relevant research and development sources include: industry consensus standards development organisations; EPRI; communications issued by NRC staff based on research conducted by national labs used by the NRC; and nuclear vendor and owner’s groups.",
            "Experience, including that involving age-related degradation, is tracked. Adverse trends are entered into the corrective action programme, as appropriate, for evaluation. If experience is identified as potentially involving aging it is evaluated with regard to systems, structures and components, materials, environments, aging effects and aging mechanisms. It will also be evaluated with regards to aging management programmes, which have an established performance feedback mechanism in place.",
            "In its application Vistra Operations said this process, in conjunction with the corrective action programme, had proven to be effective in learning from adverse conditions and events, and improving programmes that address age-related degradation. However, to provide additional assurance that internal and external operating experience related to aging management is used effectively – including NRC and industry guidance documents and standards – Comanche Peak will enhance its programme to:",
            "Require the review of internal and external experience for aging-related degradation or impacts to aging management activities, to determine if improvements to aging management activities are warranted.",
            "Provide procedural guidance for identifying and reviewing experience. This will aim to identify aging that is in excess of what would be expected, relative to design, previous inspection experience and the inspection intervals.",
            "Establish coding for use in identification, trending, and communications of aging-related degradation.",
            "Establish guidelines for reporting plant-specific operational experience on age-related degradation and aging management to the industry.",
            "Provide training, on a periodic basis, to those responsible for AMP implementation and those responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and communicating operational experience items related to aging management and aging-related degradation.",
            "This will begin as soon as renewed operating licences are issued and will continue throughout the remaining plant lifetime.",
            "Any power plant in its fourth decade will have seen a number of its systems upgraded or replaced. In some cases the most suitable fate of the original system has been to remain in place, capped, closed or otherwise made safe for the remainder of the plant lifetime. Comanche Peak has several such abandoned systems:",
            "The chemical feed system for steam generators in Unit 1 was removed from service when the new steam generators were installed. The remaining Unit 1 chemical feed recirculation components (pumps, piping, pipe supports and instrumentation) have been disconnected, capped and abandoned in place. The reverse osmosis system portion of the liquid waste processing system is not used at either unit at Comanche Peak and many of the systems’ associated components have been abandoned in place.",

            "Finland’s Loviisa NPP had “a good production year in 2022”, according to owner/operator Fortum. The two-unit NPP generated a total of 7.9 TWh avoiding 6m tonnes of CO2 emissions. The load factor for the plant, at 89.4%, was among the best in the world for pressurised water reactors (PWRs), the company said. Loviisa 1’s load factor was 90.5%, and Loviisa 2’s was 88.2%.",
            "Loviisa 1&2 are 520MWe Soviet-designed VVER-440 PWRs Loviisa 1 began commercial operation in 1977 and Loviisa 2 in 1981.The operating licences for the units were renewed in 1998 and 2007 and Fortum has applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs & Employment to operate both until the end of 2050. Their current licences expire at the end of 2027 and 2030, respectively.",
            "In 2022, Loviisa 2 underwent the extensive 36-day four-yearly outage which lasted five days longer than planned. The refuelling outage at unit 1 lasted 29 days and was delayed by about a week. Loviisa NPP Vice President Sasu Valkamo said the annual outages were challenging, but all the modification and repair works were completed. “The main reason for the delay with unit 1 was due to a leak in the main reactor coolant pump’s sealing water line, detected during a leak test,” he said. “The most significant reason for the delay with unit 2 was the replacement of a main reactor coolant pump, which had failed during the start-up phase, with a serviced pump.”",
            "Loviisa NPP currently uses Russian supplied fuel delivered by Rosatom’s Tvel, and this is set to continue for several more years according to the current contract which is valid until the expiration of the current licences in 2027 and 2030. Despite European pressure to diversify away from dependence on Russian fuel, Fortum has indicated that a quick change is not possible. At present no other company makes fuel for Soviet-designed VVER-440s, although US Westinghouse is working on developing it. Westinghouse has developed fuel for the larger Russian-designed VVER-1000 reactors and Fortum in November signed an agreement with Westinghouse for the design, licensing and supply of a new type of fuel for Loviisa.",

The move aims to support development of alternatives to Russian fuel supply and strengthen UK energy security, Energy & Climate Minister Graham Stuart said. This will also support government plans to secure up to 24GWe of nuclear power by 2050.",

The first is a consortium led by Westinghouse Electric Spain (a subsidiary of US-based Westinghouse) and including Jacobs Slovakia. The second is a consortium led by the Lithuanian Energy Institute and the French company Electricite de France (EDF), consisting of EDF and Graphitec. Preliminary contracts were concluded for four years, the maximum price of each being €5.5 million ($5.86m) excluding VAT.",
            "Services for the design of reactor dismantling technologies will be provided in two stages. At the 1st stage, a concept for dismantling the reactor will be developed. Each contractor will develop and offer two engineering solutions. INPP, in consultation with stakeholders (Lithuania’s Energy Ministry; Central Project Management Agency; nuclear regulator Vatesi; and the European Commission), will evaluate the proposed options and select the best concept, on the basis of which the procurement of engineering design services and licensing services for reactor dismantling will follow. The second stage (technological design, safety analysis report and other documents) is aimed at further development of the selected reactor dismantling concept, which will be acquired through separate procurement after completion of the preliminary contracts.",
            "“Today we have reached an important milestone in the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant decommissioning project. Reactor core decommissioning is the most complex part of decommissioning.” said INPP Director General Audrius Kamenas. “It is very important for us that these world-famous companies, which have accumulated significant professional experience and develop cutting-edge innovations, become participants in the INPP decommissioning project. I firmly believe that the knowledge and experience they will bring to the project will be invaluable and will lay a solid foundation for further dismantling of the Ignalina NPP reactors.”",
            "The project is funded by the EU Ignalina Programme. INPP comprised two Soviet-built water-cooled graphite-moderated channel-type RBMK-1500 reactors. Lithuania agreed to close the plant as part of its accession agreement to the European Union (EU), which argued that lack of containment made the units unsafe. Ignalina 1 closed in 2004 and Ignalina 2 – which accounted for 25% of Lithuania’s electricity generating capacity and supplied about 70% of Lithuania’s electrical demand – closed in 2009. Lithuania subsequently became an energy importer. The past few years has seen INPP focusing on defueling the reactors.",
            "Technologies for dismantling of graphite channel reactors are currently being developed in Russia. Neither Westinghouse nor EDF have any experience in dismantling such reactors. In 2020, Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom set up an engineering centre for the decommissioning of RBMK units (ODIC RBMK) at the Leningrad NPP, where two RBMK units have been closed pending commission with two more to close in the near future. ODIC RBMK is developing methods for the safe serial decommissioning of shutdown power units of NPPs with channel-type reactors. In addition, a structural unit has been created at the site of the Beloyarsk NPP, which has two closed AMB graphite channel reactors.",

Both plants are more than a decade behind their original schedule and significantly over budget. The 1600MWe Flamanville 3 EPR, which started construction in December 2007, was originally expected to cost €3bn and to be ready in four years. Construction of OL3 began in 2005 and was originally scheduled for completion in 2009. The cost of Olkiluoto-3 was initially put at €3.2bn, but in 2012 Areva estimated the overall cost at €8.5bn.",

Construction of HPC began in December 2018 and unit 1 was originally scheduled to start up by the end of 2025. In May, EDF announced the start of electricity generation for HPC 1 is now expected in June 2027 with project completion costs estimated at GBP25-26 billion.",
            "The only two EPR reactors in operation are at China’s Taishan NPP in Guangdong province – both constructed with significant Chinese participation. Construction of Taishan 1 began in 2009, followed by unit 2 in 2010. The EPRs entered commercial operation in December 2018 and September 2019, some five years behind schedule.",
            "France said earlier this year that it preparing legislation to reduce red tape related to nuclear power projects and aims to start construction of its first next-generation EPR2 reactor before May 2027. President Emmanuel Macron announced plans in February to build at least six EPR2 reactors, as well as the possibility of eight additional reactors, with a first project from 2028 and initial commissioning by 2035. The EPR2 is a third-generation design produced by Framatome and EDF. It is an “optimised” version of the original EPR. France currently is offering its EPR for construction in Slovakia and India. It recently lost a tender for Poland’s first NPP which was awarded to US Westinghouse."

            "Georgia Power has announced the completion of cold hydro testing for unit 4 of the Vogtle NPP nuclear expansion project. The completion of cold hydro testing is required to support hot functional testing, which is projected to start by the end of the first quarter of 2023.",
            "\"The team at the Vogtle 3&4 site continues to make important progress as we move closer to bringing online the first new nuclear units to be built in the country in over 30 years. Completion of cold hydro testing on Unit 4 is another critical milestone along the path to get us there,\" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power. \"These units are a long-term investment for our state and essential to building the future of energy for Georgia. For the next 60 to 80 years, they will help us continue to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for our customers, serving generations of Georgians as clean, emission-free sources of energy.\"",
            "Cold hydro testing at unit 4 confirmed the reactor's coolant system functions as designed and verified the welds, joints, pipes and other components of the coolant system and associated high-pressure systems do not leak when under pressure. As part of the testing, the reactor coolant system was filled with water and pressurised above-normal operating conditions, then lowered to normal design pressure while comprehensive inspections were conducted to verify the systems meet design standards.",
            "Closed vessel testing (CVT), completed in early November, verified that the pipes and valves in the unit 4 reactor coolant system are installed as designed and helps ensure safety systems function properly, Georgia Power said. To carry out CVT on the plant's passive safety systems, workers installed the reactor vessel head as well as the lower and upper reactor internals and flow restrictors which will be used during hot functional testing to mimic flow through the reactor core.",
            "Also in November, the unit 4 turbine was rotated on its turning gear for the first time, demonstrating the turbine was assembled with quality and that integrated oil systems function as designed. The main turbine system consists of one high-pressure turbine and four low-pressure turbines. Rotating the turbines on the turning gear ties in all the oil systems and a significant number of supporting systems in the turbine island, which is a separate structure outside of the unit's nuclear containment building. Once operational, the turbine will rotate at 1,800 revolutions per minute, propelled by steam produced by the unit's two steam generators using heat transferred from the nuclear reactor. The turbine blades turn the generator rotor to produce electricity.",
            "Following the loading of nuclear fuel for Vogtle 3 in October, teams at the site have continued to advance through various phases of start-up testing. Vogtle Unit 3 is projected to enter service in the first quarter of 2023.",
            "Construction of Vogtle 3 began in March 2013 and Vogtle 4 in the following November – both Westinghouse AP1000 reactors. Southern Nuclear and Georgia Power, both subsidiaries of Southern Company, took over management of the project to build the units in 2017 following Westinghouse's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Vogtle 3&4 – totalling 2,200MWe, are the first nuclear units to be built in the USA in more than three decades. However, cost overruns and construction problems have delayed the project.",

            "On the safety of the Zaporizhzhia NPP (ZNPP) “there is a concrete proposal and important progress has been made”, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on 2 December in an interview with Italy’s La Repubblica. He added: “The two sides now agree on some fundamental principles. The first is that of protection: it means accepting that you do not shoot on the facility and from the facility. The second is the recognition that the IAEA represents the only possible way forward: it was the heart of my meeting with President Putin in St Petersburg on 11 October.”",
            "The interviewer cited Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba as saying ZNPP’s protection depends on the withdrawal of heavy weapons and Russian soldiers. Grossi replied: “The withdrawal of armaments from the plant is what, understandably from their point of view, the Ukrainians ask. It would still be part of the general agreement.” He noted further: “Russia is not against an agreement and the principle of plant protection.”",
            "Asked about the possibility of Russia abandoning the plant, he replied: “Our aim is to avoid a nuclear accident, not to provoke a militarily favourable situation for one or the other.” Grossi said he was committed to achieving a solution soon “I hope by the end of the year. I know that President Putin is following the situation and I am not excluding a new meeting with him shortly, as well as with Ukrainian President Zelensky.”",
            "He confirmed that ZNPP “has electricity that guarantees the management of cooling and emergency systems”, adding: “But some nodes of the electricity grid that feed it are attacked periodically, with strokes of surgical precision.\" Asked who was responsible for the shelling he said: “It is not my job to attribute responsibility. For me the important thing is to avoid a nuclear accident and reach an agreement, not to be a judge.\"",
            "Although Gross said nothing really new in this interview, it was reported widely in the Russian media, and in many cases misinterpreted as predicting a possible Russian withdrawal from the plant in the event of an IAEA sponsored agreement. This was exacerbated by a report on 3 December by Meduza – a Latvian-based Russian press service which purports to be independent, but is generally recognised as having close links with Ukraine. Meduza report repeated earlier Ukrainian reports that Russia was planning to leave the plant, despite categorical denials from high-ranking Russian officials that this was not the case.",
            "Meduza said the Ukrainian General Staff had announced that some Russian military units were leaving the Zaporizhzhia region and were also preparing to evacuate members of local Russian-appointed occupying administrations. “In conversation with sources close to the Kremlin and the Russian government, Meduza learned that Russia isn’t exactly planning a complete withdrawal from the region. Sources speculate, however, that Moscow might be ready to leave the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant,” it said. “The Kremlin now appears to be planning to transfer control over the NPP either to Kyiv or to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).",
            "It continued: “Meduza’s sources close to both the Kremlin and the Russian government suggest that, to Moscow, the NPP is a bargaining chip, which it hopes to exchange for guarantees of unhampered oil and gas transit across Ukraine. According to two insiders who spoke with Meduza, both the Kremlin and the cabinet are “ready to make a deal.”",
            "Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov rejected any possibility of bargaining over the NPP, and other analysts pointed out that oil and gas transit across Ukraine was not an issue for Russia. In a long discussion in BFM.ru on 5 December, internationally recognised Russian commentator George Bovt, referring to Grossi’s latest interview, noted: “If you read Ukrainian sources, most of them predict the imminent withdrawal of Russian troops from the Zaporizhia NPP…. Apparently, the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi is also leaning towards this most desirable version of the agreement, hoping to conclude it before the New Year… In this case, the agency will advocate the creation of a certain demilitarised zone around the nuclear power plant, which, in the eyes of the IAEA, would be only a temporary solution, because the IAEA still considers Zaporizhia NPP to belong to Ukraine.” Citing Peskov’s denials, he added that this is not a “likely” scenario, because Russian troop withdrawal from the plant would immediately lead to its takeover by Ukraine.",
            "Bovt notes “a number of indirect signs also indicate that Moscow is not yet considering the option of completely abandoning the plant as part of the agreement under the auspices of the IAEA”. He points to the recent appointment by Russia’s Rosenergoatom of a new ZNPP director – former chief engineer of the station Yuri Chernichuk – and the transfer of the plant to the specially created Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhia NPP by presidential decree. He also noted that employees who had not signed new contracts with Rosenergoatom are no longer allowed to work at the plant.",
            "This was confirmed by ZNPP’s Telegram channel on 3 December, which said: Only Rosatom employees now work at ZNPP. Ukrainian employees who refused to sign contracts with Rosatom are not allowed to work.” This came two days after Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom “dismissed” Chernichuk for \"collaborative and treasonous activities\" and appointed instead Dmytro Verbytskyi as acting director general of the plant, and Igor Murashov as chief engineer, who IAEA acknowledged “are not on the site”. Energoatom head Petro Kotin said Chernichuk had \"betrayed Ukraine\" and urged pro Ukrainian staff at ZNPP “to hold on. He warned those who signed contracts with Rosenergoatom that “the transition to Russian structures will make you direct assistants of the aggressor, and therefore enemies of your own compatriots”.",
            "Bovt also said that, while the NPP is still connected to the Ukrainian power grid, “this is done in order to feed the cooling system of the plant, all the reactors of which are stopped”. He added: “At the same time, a power transmission line is being built at an accelerated pace, which will connect the nuclear power plant with the Crimea, after which it is planned to be completely disconnected from the Ukrainian energy system.”",
            "Bovt suggests a “more likely” future scenario “in which Russian troops will withdraw only heavy weapons from the station, although the Russian side insists that they are not there now”. After that, “a local ceasefire will be established and the IAEA monitoring mission will be strengthened”. He adds: “If the agreement is implemented in this form, it will remove, at least temporarily, the threat of a nuclear catastrophe due to artillery attacks.”",
            "However, he points out that this will still only be a relatively short-term solution. The reactors will continue to be shut down, and ZNPP will not supply energy to Ukraine. “Kiev, of course, would like to return it to operation at least partially, but this directly contradicts the current tactics of the Russian army aimed at destroying the energy infrastructure of Ukraine.”",
            "In its latest update on ZNPP, IAEA said the site continues to receive off-site power through a single 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line, with one 330kV back up line from the nearby thermal power plant switchyard available. IAEA confirmed that Russia is working to activate additional power lines. “ZNPP site management has informed the IAEA team that they had received information from Rosatom that a further 330kV power line to the thermal power plant switchyard is being repaired and should be ready soon as an additional back-up power line in case of loss of the 750kV and 330 kV power lines that are routed from Ukraine controlled territory. It was also reported by site management that a further two power 330kV power lines may also be restored, but no deadline was given. There is no information regarding any plans to restore any of the lost 750kV power lines.”",
            "IAEA also said up to 70 mobile diesel boilers are being gradually deployed in operators’ city of Enerhodar to provide for heating of communal buildings, houses and flats. “Currently, these boilers operate at a local school, kindergarten and the hospital. Up to seven mobile diesel boilers are being deployed on the ZNPP site to heat buildings at the site.” Four of the reactor units remain in cold shutdown, while the two other units are in hot shutdown – enabling them to provide steam to the plant and heat to Enerhodar.”",
            "Russian commentator Yuri Podolyaka, citing a former employee of the Ukrainian Energoatom, pointed out on 4 December that Rosatom will not restart ZNPP units 1-4 until the end of the war because they contain American Westinghouse fuel which would first need to be unloaded as Russia does not have the expertise to use such fuel."

The signing of the contract will be followed by a thorough preparation of the project documentation in order to adhere to a deadline of 2036 for the start of the new unit test operation. The new Dukovany unit will be built next to the existing power plant and serve as a future replacement for a portion of its installed capacity.”",

After the Ministry of the Environment issued a positive opinion on the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in 2019, it also received a Siting Permit from the State Office for Nuclear Safety and a Generating Facility Authorisation from the Ministry of Industry & Trade last year. The zoning procedure is currently underway, for which EDU II applied to the building authority on 1 June 2021. ČEZ has also announced plans to build a small modular reactors (SMR) at the Temelin site. The government has been considering restructuring, which is 70% state-owned, in the coming years, which could lead to the government fully taking over the nuclear projects.",

            "ENSREG members include the national nuclear safety regulators of all 27 EU countries, with Belarus, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey as observers. The meeting was also attended by SNRIU and the Western European Nuclear Regulators Association, which encompasses a similar membership to ENSREG, with the addition of the UK and more observers, including Japan and the USA.",
            "“condemns strongly the Russian Federation’s military attacks on nuclear power plants and the Ukrainian electrical grid”;",
            "calls for urgently establishing a nuclear safety and security protection zone at ZNPP, “provided that such zone respects Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity and supports the IAEA Director General’s efforts in this respect”;",
            "urges Russia to “immediately cease all actions against, and at, ZNPP and any other nuclear facility in Ukraine and allow the competent Ukrainian authorities to regain full control over all nuclear facilities within Ukraine’s internationally recognized borders”;",
            "calls for reinforcing the international rules to prohibit armed attacks against any nuclear installation devoted to peaceful purposes;",
            "supports the acceleration of Ukraine’s integration in all crises response mechanisms for nuclear emergency.",
            "Since Russia took control of ZNPP in March the Russian national guard has been protecting the station and on 5 October, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally transferring ZNPP to Russian jurisdiction under nuclear utility Rosenergoatom (part of Rosatom). A Russian Federal State Unitary Enterprise, JSC Zaporizhzhia NPP, has been established by Rosenergoatom to operate the plant. It is headed by the former chief engineer of Russia’s Balakov NPP, Oleg Romanenko. However, Energoatom continues to claim ownership of the plant and the IAEA recognises this claim.",
            "On 30 November, Russian further strengthened control of ZNPP, when the Advisor to the General Director of Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa, appointed Yuri Alekseyevich Chernichuk as Director of ZNPP and first deputy director of plant operator JSC Zaporizhzhia NPP under Romanenko. Chernichuk was former Chief Engineer of ZNPP and also former head of ZNPP unit 4 as well as chief engineer at Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom. Karchaa described his as “an extremely decent person”. ZNPP has been without a Director since Igor Murashov was convicted of cooperation with the Ukrainian intelligence services on 30 September and was expelled to Ukrainian territory.",
            "Chernichuk told Ria Novosti that the entire management team at ZNPP, including the position of the chief engineer, now comprises representatives of the former plant staff who have signed a new employment contracts with Rosenergoatom. Karchaa confirmed this: \"The entire management team, including the chief engineer, his deputies and all the key positions in general, are currently occupied by representatives of the former team who signed contracts with the operating company, so I suggest that the gentlemen on the other side of the [Dnepr] river [Energoatom] and their supervisors finally calm down.\" He noted that the salaries for certain categories of personnel had been increased by 30%.",
            "The new appointment was welcomed by the Acting Governor of Zaporizhia Region, Yevhen Balitsky, who noted his managerial experience at the plant. “Yuri Alekseyevich is a specialist who has worked at ZNPP for many years, is well versed in all the technical issues of the plant's operation and has managerial experience,\" he wrote on his Telegram channel. “It is very important that the management of the station is in reliable and professional hands. In the hands of people who are able to make prompt decisions in the face of constant provocations from neighbouring territories.\"",
            "In a lengthy interview with TASS on 30 November Rosenergoatom’s Renat Karchaa described the situation at ZNPP. He said closure of the ZNPP units was perceived by the personnel “as a personal grief”. Initially they were scared by the shelling but after the forced shutdown unit 6, when the station completely switched to the cold shutdown mode, “fear was replaced by deep despondency, they were depressed,” he said. “When we recently managed to put one of the reactors into a hot shutdown state, all the employees came to life and cheered up,” but further shelling caused it to be stopped again.",
            "He said that before the start of the special military operation the station's staff consisted of approximately 11,000 people. “Some people left, including to visit relatives in Ukraine. … To date, approximately 5,000 people continue to work.” More than 2,400 of them signed contracts with the new operating company. “Now they are full-time employees, and their bank cards receive salaries that exceed the previous salary by 20-30% in certain categories. These people have a decent social package.” He said some had taken Russian passports but others were afraid to do so as Ukraine is threatening them with a criminal prosecution for collaboration, including 12 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property. He added that “collaboration means the most minimal contact with representatives of the Russian government”.",
            "He said that after the NPP became Russian property, the activities of the plant and its staff, as well as all enterprises of the domestic nuclear industry, should be brought into compliance with Russian standards and regulations but “it's not easy to do this overnight”. He added: First, people have been under stress for a very long time. Secondly, nuclear scientists are intelligent people who think, and we are not going to bring anyone to their knees because it is not appropriate to do this to people.” At his first meeting with the staff, he said “one simple thing – for us, nuclear safety is not just a reactor, a steam generator, a turbine, or some other technological unit. For us, nuclear safety is about the people involved in the process.”",
            "Karchaa explained that currently ZNPP has no external power supply which means no real heat supply for Energodar from units 5&6 which are under hot shutdown. The temperature in the batteries leaves much to be desired,” he said. He added that work was underway to connect to transmission lines in Russia. “Currently, there are two main transmission lines. One of them passes through Kakhovka in the Kherson region, and it suffered huge damage as a result of artillery strikes … The second line runs on the route Dzhankoy-Melitopol-Molochansk-Energodar. Ukraine was well aware that we were looking for an alternative way to supply and withdraw electricity. That is why the Energodar thermal power plant has become the target of Ukrainian artillery.",
            "Currently Russia is carrying out an inventory at the station, he said. “Ukraine's constant shelling hinders the process but the inventory will definitely be completed. … Everything is moving more slowly than we would like, due to objective circumstances which are not under our control. He also confirmed that ZNPP would eventually be a switched back to using Russian fuel rather than fuel from Westinghouse. He noted that work was already underway to build extra protection for the used fuel storage areas. “No one has ever studied the consequences of damage to containers with used nuclear fuel through artillery strikes from the point of view of radiation hazard. It is necessary to understand how many containers will be depressurised, how much radioactive material will get into the external environment, and take into account the wind direction. The case of the ZNPP is unique. No nuclear power plant has ever been shelled by artillery.”",
            "On the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) he stressed that it is an organisation that deals primarily with nuclear safety. “The IAEA is objectively unable to influence the actions of the military. This is outside the scope of the organization's competencies and real leverage. The creation of a security zone, which is so actively promoted by the leadership of this international institution, is a long and very difficult process. But an indispensable and obligatory condition for this is the unconditional cessation of artillery attacks, which, as you know, are carried out exclusively by Ukraine.”"

The new fuel type is based on British Nuclear Fuel Limited’s fuel that was supplied to the Loviisa plant from 2001 to 2007, and used in parallel with the fuel supplied by the Russian TVEL in the early 2000s. Taking the new fuel into use is a multi-year project requiring regulatory approvals.",
            "“The new and parallel fuel supplier will diversify our fuel strategy, improve security of supply and ensure reliable electricity production at the Loviisa power plant also in the future,” said Sasu Valkamo, Vice President, Loviisa NPP. “We are proud to support Fortum’s operating fleet with fuel reload quantities, building on our successful collaboration delivering VVER-440 fuel for Loviisa from 2001 to 2007,\" says Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel.",
            "Loviisa NPP comprises two Soviet designed VVER-440 units, which were commissioned in 1977 and 1980.",

            ". Loviisa’s current fuel agreement with the TVEL is valid until the end of the current operating licences of the plants two units in 2027 and 2030. In spring 2022, Fortum applied for a",
            "new operating licence for both units until 2050",
            ", and announced that a tendering process will be arranged for fuel supply for the new operating licence period. Currently Westinghouse does not produce VVER-440 assemblies, although it is now supplying fuel for Soviet-designed VVER-1000 reactors in Ukraine.",
            "In September, Westinghouse and Spain’s Enusa Industrias Avanzadas announced their intention to",
            "collaborate on VVER-440 fuel fabrication",
            "with the aim of delivering a Western alternative to Russian fuel in the European market where there are currently VVER-440s operating using fuel from TVEL.

            "Between 2001 and 2007, BNFL/Westinghouse delivered a total of 741 VVER-440 fuel assemblies to the Loviisa NPP in Finland which were manufactured by Enusa in Spain. The fuel assembly design – NOVA E-3 (fixed assembly) and NOVCA (follower) – was developed in 1996-98 in a programme involving BNFL (UK), IVO (Finland) and PAKS (Hungary). The programme included extensive testing and qualification of the new design. In June 1998, the manufacturing of five Lead Test Assemblies – four fixed and one follower assembly – in Springfields, UK, was completed and the fuel was delivered for insertion in Loviisa unit 2.",
            "The NOVA E-3 and NOVCA designs were integrated into the Westinghouse fuel product portfolio, and all the intellectual property for the VVER-440 fuel was transferred from BNFL to Westinghouse in 2005-2006. However, after failing to extend the Loviisa fuel contract and failing to win any other VVER-440 delivery contracts, Westinghouse decided to withdraw from the market in 2008, and closed down the supply chain and design development of the VVER-440 design.",
            "Then, in 2014 reactivation of the VVER-440 market was considered in view of the demand for increased security of energy supply in Europe. Westinghouse, in a consortium comprising nine organisations, applied for a Euratom funded programme for diversification of the VVER fuel market in Europe, and was granted €2 million in 2015 to run the ESSANUF programme.",

            "Powerful explosions shook the area of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) on the evening of 19 November and the following morning, abruptly ending a period of relative calm at the facility and further underlining the urgent need for measures to help prevent a nuclear accident there, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said on 20 November.",
            "In what appeared to be renewed shelling both close to and at the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, IAEA experts at the ZNPP reported to Agency headquarters that more than a dozen blasts were heard within a short period of time in the morning local time. The IAEA team could also see some of the explosions from their windows.",
            "Citing information provided by plant management, the IAEA team said there had been damage to some buildings, systems and equipment at the ZNPP site, but none of them so far critical for nuclear safety and security. There were no reports of casualties. The IAEA experts are in close contact with site management and will continue to assess and report on the situation.",
            "“The news from our team yesterday and this morning is extremely disturbing. Explosions occurred at the site of this major nuclear power plant, which is completely unacceptable. Whoever is behind this, it must stop immediately. As I have said many times before, you’re playing with fire!” Grossi said.",
            "He renewed his urgent appeal to both sides in the conflict to agree and implement a nuclear safety and security zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible. In recent months, he has engaged in intense consultations with Ukraine and Russia about establishing such a zone, but so far without an agreement. “I’m not giving up until this zone has become a reality. As the ongoing apparent shelling demonstrates, it is needed more than ever,” he said.",
            "ZNPP provided about a fifth of Ukraine’s electricity before the start of Russia’s special military operation and has been forced to operate on back-up generators a number of times after shelling damaged key transmission lines. It has six Soviet-designed VVER-1000 V-320 water-cooled and water-moderated reactors which used to use Russian supplied fuel that was then taken back and reprocessed in Russia. However Ukraine changed to Westinghouse supplied fuel and that used fuel is now stored at a dry storage facility on site. Although the reactors are now shut down they still required power to operate their cooling systems.",
            "The Russian Defence Ministry said on 20 November said the previous day “Ukrainian artillery fired 11 large-calibre artillery shells at the nuclear power plant” and had fired again twice the next day. “From 9.15 to 9.45, 12 large-calibre artillery shells were fired. Eight of them exploded between the fifth power unit and special building No 2, three hit between the fourth and fifth power units, and one hit the roof of special building No 2. From 10 o'clock to 10.10 minutes, two more projectiles were recorded, fired along the power transmission line that feeds the power plant,\" the Ministry noted. The shooting was conducted from the area of the settlement of Marganets in the Dnipropetrovsk region, controlled by the Ukrainian military, and the firepower was suppressed by the return fire from Russian artillery units, the Ministry added.",
            "Renat Karchaa, adviser at Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom, confirmed the shelling. Rosenergoatom formally took control of ZNPP following the September referendum in which the majority of the Zaporozhye population reportedly voted for integration with Russia. A number of Rosenergoatom specialists are now permanently working at the plant, although the majority of the staff are Ukrainian. Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom still insists it owns the plant. Karchaa said six projectiles had hit the cooling system of one of the reactors and two struck the radioactive waste storage. He added that the employees were unharmed. “We are talking about the perimeter of the station itself, and not about the wider industrial zone. There were six flights to the splash pool, which is a cooling system. Two arrivals were in the area of a dry nuclear waste storage facility. And there were three more arrivals in the area of checkpoint-2, \" he told Rossiya–24.",
            "Scientific Secretary of the All-Russian Research Institute for the Operation of Nuclear Power Plants (VNIIAES) Alexander Prosvirnov, told Ria Novosti that the reactor units themselves are well protected — their containment is able to withstand the fall of a light aircraft weighing up to 20 tons, he said. At the same time, the storage of nuclear waste is a more accessible target. \"This is a more vulnerable object, and it can pose a radiation hazard when hit by projectiles. This is a kind of analogue of the ‘dirty bomb’, \" he said.",
            "According to Ukraine’s Energoatom, which blamed the shelling on Russia, “overpasses linking the facility to special buildings, storage tanks of demineralised water, steam generator blowdown system, auxiliary systems of one of the two plantwide diesel engines, and other equipment of the power plant infrastructure were damaged”. Three hits were also recorded in the area of the Raiduha substation. The damage and destruction there are still being assessed.”",
            "Meanwhile, the IAEA Board of Governors adopted a draft resolution calling on the Russian Federation to leave ZNPP. \"The Board of Governors expresses regret and does not recognise the attempts of the Russian Federation to take over the Ukrainian Zaporizhzhia NPP and calls on the Russian Federation to immediately abandon its unfounded claims to ownership of this plant,\" the resolution said. Finland and Canada initiated the vote. The draft resolution was approved by 24 of 35 Board members. Russia and China voted against while India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam, South Africa, Kenya and Namibia abstained. Two other states did not participate in the voting.",
            "Earlier, on 16 November, an update from IAEA noted that Ukraine's Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plant (KhNPP) had lost all access to the electricity grid the day before due to military attacks, forcing it to temporarily rely on diesel generators for back-up power, citing information Grossi had received from Ukrainian authorities.",
            "The KhNPP’s grid connection was completely lost at 18:35 local time on 15 November, after the site’s four operating power lines were progressively lost over a two-and-a-half-hour period because of missile attacks on the country’s energy infrastructure, Ukraine told the IAEA. During this period, the plant’s two reactors were shut down, halting their delivery of electricity to households, factories and others.",
            "More than nine hours later – at 03:45 this morning – the plant regained off-site electricity through two 330 kilovolt (kV) back-up power lines, and the diesel generators were stopped. One of those lines was again lost about an hour later and only restored at 11:25. The two reactor units remain in shutdown mode.",
            "Another nuclear power plant also located in western Ukraine – Rivne – lost the connection to one of its 750 kV power lines on 15 November. As a result, the plant reduced its power output, and one of its four units was automatically disconnected. At 04:00 today, the plant increased the power of one of its other units to continue supplying electricity to the Ukrainian network.",
            "“This was a very concerning development. It shows the potential nuclear safety and security risks facing all of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities during this terrible war, not just the ZNPP. While off-site power is now back at the Khmelnytskyy Nuclear Power Plant, the power loss clearly demonstrates that the nuclear safety and security situation in Ukraine can suddenly take a turn for the worse, increasing the risk of a nuclear emergency,” Grossi said.",
            "The power loss at the KhNPP came just a day after the IAEA announced it would in the coming weeks send nuclear safety and security missions to this plant, Rivne and the South Ukraine NPP as well as to Chornobyl. The missions are being organised at the request of Ukraine. “We will be at these nuclear power plants in the near future as part of our steadfast assistance to Ukraine in its efforts to maintain nuclear safety and security and prevent a nuclear accident during the conflict,” Grossi said. The IAEA has had a permanent team of experts at ZNPP since September."

            "Currently, Brazil has two nuclear power plants in operation, both in Angra dos Reis, on the Costa Verde, in Rio de Janeiro. Angra 1&2, a total of 1.9GWe, generate 1.1% of the energy of the Brazilian Interconnected System (SIN). Angra 1 is a 609MWe Westinghouse PWR 609, which began operation in 1982 following long delays. Unit 2 is a 1,275MWe PWR supplied by German Kraftwerk Union that began operation in 2000, again after long delays. Eletrobrás is working with Westinghouse to extend the operating lifetime of Angra 1 from 40 to 60 years.",
            "Work on Angra 3, a Siemens/KWU 1,405MWe PWR began in 1984 but was suspended two years later. Work resumed in 2006, but was suspended a number of times for financial and political reasons. It was stopped again in 2015 when it was 65% complete. Preparation for the restart of concreting began in February 2022 with the signing of a contract between Eletronuclear and the AGIs consortium, comprising Ferreira Guedes, Matricial and ADtranz. This included the assembly of a concrete plant on site in September, and numerous field and laboratory tests.",
            "Eletronuclear noted that “the quality of the concrete, both of the aggregated elements – such as sand, stone, water and cement – and their proportion in the final mixture, the so-called TRACE, is the subject of rigorous technical evaluation by Eletronuclear and the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN), which authorised the restart of concreting”.",
            "The pouring of first concrete signalled the start of the Angra 3 Critical Path Acceleration Plan, which aims to complete the civil works of the main buildings of the plant. In addition, it is planned to carry out part of the electromechanical assembly, such as the closure of the containment and the installation of key equipment, such as the used fuel pool, the polar bridge and the semi-gantry crane. The unit will, as originally planned, use German origin technology developed by Siemens/KWU, which is now owned by the French company Framatome.",
            "Last year, several preliminary stages were carried out, including the conclusion of the bidding process for contracting the works to resume the civil works and part of the electromechanical assembly. According to the financial statements of Eletrobras, then the controller of Eletronuclear, investments in Angra 3 totalled BRL1.24 billion ($233m) in 2021. Although the privatisation of Eletrobras was concluded in 2022, Eletronuclear was part of a group of subsidiaries maintained under the control of the State. They were integrated into a new state-owned company, Empresa Brasileira de Participacoes em Energia Nuclear e Binacional (ENBpar), which led the resumption of the Angra 3 works.",

It assumes the development of a plan for the construction of a NPP in Pątnów based on the APR1400 technology. The preliminary plan for the development of the power plant is to be ready by the end of this year.",

The Pątnów plant, which has been operating for more than 50 years is now to be used as the basis for the new NPP. – “We showed the Koreans that we not only have this old cooling system that we have successfully used over the years in a brown coal power plant, but that we have a tank that holds 120 million cubic metres. Ultimately, it will be 140-145 million cubic meters. We also showed an open pit, from which in March next year we will dig the last ton of coal, and there we will be able to store 220 million cubic metres of water,” said Piotr Woźny, President of the Management Board of ZE PAK.",

The event was jointly hosted by KHNP, Korea Nuclear Export Industry Association (KNA), and the Polish Electricity Industry Association (IGEOS). Team Korea – including Kepco E&C, Kepco Nuclear Fuel, Kepco KPS, Doosan Energy, and Daewoo E&C – participated in the symposium.",
            "During the symposium, KHNP said it proposes that 20% of the costs would be financed from partners' equity shared 49% from KHNP and 51% by the Polish partner. The other 80% of the costs would be debt financing shared 51% from the Polish partner and 49% from Korean export support institutions – K-EXIM and K-SURE, and from other sources.",

        "text": [
            "Following Poland’s announcement that its first NPP would be built by Westinghouse, Vakis Ramany, EDF vice president responsible for international development of nuclear energy, has said: “EDF, with the support of the French government, maintains and renews its integrated EPR-based offer to secure and accelerate the Polish nuclear power programme.” He argued that EPR technology and EDF “remain the best fit and the best chance for the Polish and other European nuclear power programs to meet their objectives”.",
            "He added: “While EDF regrets its preliminary offer submitted in October 2021, based on the 100%-European 1650MW EPR, has not been discussed as part of a competitive process for a 1st site (where technical, industrial, commercial and financial criteria would have prevailed), one must commend the Polish government’s resolute approach to include nuclear in the future energy mix of Poland.”",
            "He noted: “As the Polish nuclear power programme aims for up to 9000MWe of nuclear capacity by 2043, EDF remains committed to support the Polish authorities to expand and accelerate their programme in the framework of a close cooperation between the French and Polish industries.”",
            "He said derisking and securing the delivery of such an ambitious program requires :",
            "full assurance that the technology meets the European standards and that the main and primary partner has all the rights to export and develop its technology;",
            "full confidence that the main and primary partner has the recent experience and the capability to perform the integration of Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Commissioning of a complete plant;",
            "full confidence that the main and primary partner knows how to support human capability building and knows how to fully involve the Polish industry;",
            "full confidence that the main and primary partner remains committed until the completion of the projects and during at least 60 years of operation.",
            "In this respect, he added:",
            "EDF has all the rights to propose its EPR technology;",
            "EPR is licensed in three countries in Europe and EDF has built, is building, and will continue to build EPR technology reactors in Europe, a unique assurance of continuous improvement towards excellence;",
            "EDF demonstrates at Hinkley Point C in the UK how it can significantly bring the local supply chain on board and boost its capabilities; French nuclear projects are already by far those providing most opportunities to Polish companies;",
            "EDF and the French industry have never abandoned their partners in any nuclear project; out of five sites originally attributed to various developers in the UK, only EDF is developing and building NPPs.",
            "Ramany argued that EDF and France’s decision to a six-unit domestic programme was the “best demonstration of confidence and long-term commitment to the EPR technology”.",
            "For all these reasons, EDF and the French government is renewing its integrated EPR-based offer to Poland. He concluded: “EDF calls for the signing of political and industrial agreements between Poland and France, so both like-minded countries can join efforts in implementing rapidly EPR projects in and for Europe.”",
            "This followed a detailed interview on the same subject, which Ramany gave to Dziennik Gazeta Prawna on 2 November, in which he stressed the importance of EDF’s experience working in Europe and the fact that neither Westinghouse nor Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power (KHNP) – the other contender in the Polish tender had built any NPP in Europe. “It is the experience of many years of work. No other supplier has such experience, which can be very useful for Poland. Our American and Korean colleagues have not built any AP1000 or APR1400 reactors in Europe to date,” he said.",
            "He noted that France and Poland had “already joined their efforts to integrate nuclear energy into the European taxonomy, enabling future investments in nuclear energy to benefit from competitive financing conditions”, adding that France and EDF were “ready to work with the Polish authorities to further strengthen the role of nuclear energy in the energy transition in Europe”. In addition, he said, EDF has designed, built and operates almost half of Europe's nuclear capacity “and is currently the only nuclear reactor builder with a confirmed programme to build new nuclear power plants in France and many projects in Europe”. This makes EDF “the best long-term partner of the Polish nuclear program, enabling Poland to quickly achieve energy sovereignty and climate goals”.",
            "He pointed out that “the process of selecting a technology supplier must be conducted in such a way that Brussels obtains appropriate guarantees”, and that EDF had experience in dealing with Brussels. “We know the requirements of the European Commission. We are ready to share our experience and work with the Polish government so that the Polish nuclear programme can count on the required support.”",
            "Ramany said EDF “is in talks with the Polish government about the investments included in the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We are talking with the Minister of Climate and Environment Anna Moskva and the government plenipotentiary for strategic energy infrastructure Mateusz Berger, who are responsible for the Polish nuclear programme. I cannot comment on other initiatives on this matter.”",
            "He emphasised three facts:",
            "The three bids currently under consideration “are non-binding bids and their details are confidential, as confirmed by the Ministry of Climate and Environment”.",
            "The price and other conditions presented by EDF are based on European conditions, “and EDF is the only bidder that has such experience in the development and construction of Generation 3+ nuclear reactors in Europe”.",
            "“Both of our competitors are based on different continents and may have to prove that they can be treated as ‘local’. When it comes to EDF's offer, EPR is the only one that is entirely based on European technology, 100%. designed and manufactured in Europe. All production plants of the main components of a nuclear power plant and fuel are located less than 1,200 km from the Polish border. Additionally… EDF is able, better than any other bidder, to organise the Polish supply chain for such a project. In fact, we've already started doing it, because 35 Polish companies have already been working on our EPR projects in Europe.”",

The agreement is valid until the expiration of the current licences of the Loviisa NPP in 2027 and 2030. Earlier this year, Fortum submitted an application to the Ministry of Labour & Economy, detailing its plans to extend the life of the reactors until 2050. The decision to renew the licence is expected in early 2023. Earlier, in its semi-annual financial report, Fortum indicated that the supplier of fuel could not be changed quickly due to certification procedures. At present no other company makes fuel for Soviet-designed VVER-440s, although US Westinghouse is reportedly working on developing it. Westinghouse has developed fuel for the larger Russian-designed VVER-1000 reactors.",
            "Fortum stated that it will invite bids from supplier candidates when the Loviisa operating licences, and the current supplier contracts, come up for renewal in 2027 and 2030. We’ll look at who’s the most suitable fuel supplier at the latest when the current contract expires,” Kattainen said.",
            "Juhani Hyvärinen, a professor of nuclear technology at Lappeenranta University, noted the relatively low number of potential suppliers. He added on a general level that the company would likely require a year or two after signing a supplier contract to take the first delivery.",
            "Nuclear fuel is presently not on the sanctions list of the European Union. The possibility of bringing it within the scope of sanctions has reportedly been discussed, but this seems unlikely during the current energy crisis. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs told YLE that adding nuclear fuel to the list would require a unanimous decision by the 27-country bloc, but declined to comment on the discussions.",

Under the plan, construction of the first three-unit NPP is expected to start in 2026, with the first 1-1.6GWe reactor being commissioned in 2033 followed by subsequent units every 2-3 years. The coastal towns of Lubiatowo and Kopalino in the Choczewo municipality have been selected as the preferred location for the first plant. A second three-unit plant is also envisaged and the US assumes that Westinghouse will supply reactors for both plants. \"We understand that the decision will be for the first three reactors and it is our expectation that Poland intends to eventually construct six AP1000 reactors from Westinghouse and will make a formal decision about the second set of three at a later date,\" an unnamed US official said.",
            "Morawiecki stressed, however, that the government is also open to a second nuclear project involving private entities (ZE PAK), companies with a State Treasury share (Polska Grupa Energetyczna PGE) and KHNP. While the official strategy assumes building six reactors in two locations by the mid-2040s, Morawiecki said a third location was not out of the question.",
            "On 31 October The Polish Ministry of State Assets, the Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, ZE PAK, PGE and KHNP signed a letter of intent for development of a NPP at ZE PAK’s Pątnów site using Korean APR1400 technology. This was followed by a memorandum of understanding (MOU), signed by the ministries, to spare no effort to provide support for the Pątnów project.",
            "Earlier, competition between Westinghouse and KHNP for the main contract had become contentious. KHNP had reportedly offered to build six APR1400 reactors with a capacity of 8.4GWe for $26.7 billion. The Westinghouse offer was $31.3 billion for six AP1000 reactors with a total capacity of 6.7GWe, while EDF’s bid for its EPR technology was for $33-48.5 billion for four to six reactors. Polish media reported that KHNP had also proposed post-construction technology transfer to Poland and media speculation was that the contract would go to KHNP.",
            "This prompted Westinghouse on 21 October to",
            "file a lawsuit against KHNP and Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO)",
            "in a US federal court to block them from selling reactors to Poland. Westinghouse said KHNP’s reactor design included intellectual property licensed by Westinghouse and required permission from Westinghouse before being transferred to Poland or any other countries considering deploying the APR1400 reactor. However, KHNP said it had gained competence in the design, production and construction of NPPs in order to finally develop its own, independent technology. \"Korean nuclear technology is independent of Westinghouse technology and can be exported without restrictions and without the consent of the US,\" it noted.",
            "The decision to choose Westinghouse for the main contract is generally seen by Polish media as a political decision affirming Poland’s increasingly close ties to Washington. \"US partnership on this project is advantageous for us all: we can address the climate crisis, strengthen European energy security, and deepen the US-Poland strategic relationship,\" US Vice President Kamala Harris said in a tweet.",
            "Harris had worked to help Westinghouse to secure the contract together with Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, engaging with Morawiecki several time over the past year, a White House official said. The selection of Westinghouse and of the USA sent a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin \"about the strength and the meshing together of a US-Poland alliance,\" another senior US government official was cited as saying.",
            "US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said the project would create or sustain more than 100,000 jobs for American workers. “This is a huge step in strengthening our relationship with Poland to create energy security for future generations to come,” she noted. “This announcement also sends a clear message to Russia: We will not let them weaponise energy any longer.”",
            "“The choice of the US technology is not surprising as the recently published environmental report for the Kopalino-Lubiatowo site was entirely based on the parameters of the AP1000 Westinghouse reactor technology,” said Adam Błażowski from Fota4Climate, a pro-nuclear climate and environmental foundation.",
            "But economics also matters, hence the parallel project with KHNP. Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister Jacek Sasin, who was in Seoul to sign the MOU with South Korea, along with KHNP, PGE and ZE PAK told Polish Radio: “We are going to build two nuclear power plants at the same time, one under the government programme and the other in a business-led programme.”",
            "According to the Letter of Intent (LOI), the parties aim to jointly prepare a plan to develop the NPP based on Korea's APR1400 technology. In particular, the parties intend to perform preliminary analysis of geotechnical, seismic and environmental conditions, develop an estimated budget for the preparatory work, construction phase and production phase along with the proposed project financing model, as well as create a variant project implementation schedule along with the definition of key stages affecting the potential project implementation. They intend to prepare a preliminary development plan by the end of 2022.",

Also, once the final contract is made, we anticipate that it will greatly contribute to revitalising the domestic nuclear industry… “The conclusion of the MOU and the LOI between the companies has laid the foundation for strengthened cooperation with Poland that leads to a mutual benefit and win-win situation.\" KHNP President & CEO Dr Jooho Whang said the request for cooperation by ZE PAK reaffirms Korea's competitiveness. “I strongly believe that potential cooperation between Poland and Korea will play a significant role in further solidifying the strong partnership between our two countries,\" he added.",
            "\"Our goal is to provide Poles with cheap and clean energy. There is no doubt that nuclear power is a source of that, said Zygmunt Solorz, Chairman of the ZE PAK Supervisory Board. “Our Pątnów location seems to be ideal for the implementation of a nuclear energy project, hence our idea to create a development plan for such a project… We have the necessary infrastructure, experience and passion of our power engineers in the region for new challenges. We are an energy company in transformation that is gradually moving away from lignite-based energy production and developing zero-emission energy sources. We have fantastic and experienced people in the energy industry, whom we want to provide the opportunity to continue working in the region. Investing in nuclear power is an opportunity for Poland, for the region, and most of all for Poles….It is also a development impulse for a number of potential Polish suppliers, work for thousands of people and the transfer of highly advanced technologies and knowledge. It is also a powerful investment in the Polish economy and significant tax revenues for the country and the region. \"",

        "title": "Westinghouse tries to exclude South Korea from Poland’s NPP project",
        "text": [
            "Westinghouse Electric Co has filed a lawsuit against Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) and Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) in federal court to block them from selling reactors to Poland.",
            "In a legal filing, Westinghouse said KHNP’s reactor design includes intellectual property licensed by Westinghouse and requires permission from Westinghouse before being transferred to Poland and any other countries considering deploying the APR1400 reactor. The filing was made after Westinghouse learned that Warsaw was preparing to sign a preliminary agreement to buy reactors from KHNP. Poland is currently evaluating offers from Westinghouse, KHNP and France’s EDF for its first commercial nuclear power plant.",
            "Six pressurised water reactors are scheduled to be built in Poland and the government is planning to select a supplier by the end of the year. Westinghouse and KHNP are also competing for newbuild projects in the Czech Republic while KHNP is also participating in the tender to supply Saudi Arabia with its first NPP.",
            "After receiving proposals from EDF, KHNP and Westinghouse Poland's government said in mid-October it would make a decision on within weeks. Polish media, citing unnamed government sources, reported that the lowest price was offered by KHNP, with Westinghouse's AP1000 reactor design being more expensive and EDF’s EPR2 the most expensive of the three. According to Polish media, KHNP could construct six 1.4GWe reactors at a total cost of $26.7 billion compared $31.3 billion for Westinghouse and $33 billion for EDF. KHNP also proposed post-construction technology transfer to Poland.",
            "However, Korea times quoted “market watchers” as saying the Polish government “appears eager” to choose Westinghouse for state-initiated projects given the need to improve ties with the US, while considering the KHNP for private projects. According to Polish and Korean press reports, KHNP is expected to build a second nuclear power plant in Poland in Pątnów, while the first plant in Pomerania is to be built by Westinghouse.",
            "PAP reported on 19 October that state-controlled power utility Polska Grupa Energetyczna (PGE) and listed private power plant operator ZE PAK planned to sign a letter of intent with KHNP on building the second plant at the end of October. PAP said a preliminary agreement would be signed within two weeks, and that the state treasury would have an \"indirect majority stake in the project. A joint consortium is to implement a project in Pątnów, according to Rzeczpospolita. The project is to replace ZEPAK’s lignite power plant in Patnow with one or more nuclear reactors. The lignite power plant is expected to close in 2024.",
            "It was this that reportedly prompted the Westinghouse lawsuit, which is based on a claim that intellectual property in KHNP’s APR1400 reactor design incorporates technology from the System 80 reactor design it acquired in 2000 from Westinghouse and that Westinghouse has intellectual property rights as a result.",
            "Westinghouse claimed in the lawsuit that KHNP conceded this when it sold four APR1400 reactors to the United Arab Emirates in 2010.",
            "Westinghouse is seeking to force KHNP to comply with US laws restricting nuclear power technology sharing. Under these rules – Part 810 requirements (10CFR810) – the US Department of Energy has statutory responsibility for authorising the transfer of unclassified nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities within the USA or abroad.",
            "S&P Global reported on 23 October that Westinghouse had asked the court to issue a judgment that the APR1400 reactor contains US-origin technology that is subject to DOE review under 10CFR810. Westinghouse also asked the court to enjoin KHNP from sharing technical information covered by Part 810 with Poland or with authorities in the Czech Republic or Saudi Arabia.",
            "However, KHNP disagrees. “After launching its own nuclear programme, Korea gradually built up technology, carrying out research and development projects with long-term plans for over 30 years. Thanks to this process, it gained competence in the design, production and construction of nuclear power plants in order to finally develop her own, independent technology,” the company said.",
            "KHNP emphasised that when exporting Korean nuclear power plants to Poland, it will fully use its own nuclear technology developed by Korean companies, to which we have full intellectual property rights. \"Korean nuclear technology is independent of Westinghouse technology and can be exported without restrictions and without the consent of the US,\" it noted.",
            "The KHNP said it will exert maximum efforts to respond appropriately to the recent developments. It is time for the government and the state-run companies to double down on winning the projects while minimising the dispute with the US. KEPCO and KHNP said in a joint statement that they will continue efforts to remove any complications in the exports of the country's nuclear power plants. \"We are aware of the lawsuit. We will outline strategies to respond to the developments in a timely and appropriately manner,\" they said.",
            "The lawsuit will undoubtedly add fire to the ongoing trade dispute after the USA legislated the Inflation Reduction Act calling for the exclusion of Korean-made electric vehicles from tax incentives. In May, Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol and US President Joe Biden had agreed to strengthen cooperation to jointly advance into overseas nuclear reactor markets. However, “the \"nuclear reactor alliance is facing hurdles due to Westinghouse's self-centred trade policy,” Korea Times noted on 26 October.",
            "The paper cited an industry official “who refused to be identified” as saying: \"Money trumps alliances. Maintaining amicable diplomatic relations is important, but not as much as financial interests in make-or-break business opportunities that can generate stable sources of income for at least a few years.\"",

        "title": "A global realignment",
        "text": [
            "The pressure on uranium supplies has also attracted the interest of commodities traders. (Credit: Shane McLendon on Unsplash)",
            "The Russian invasion of Ukraine “sent a shiver down the spine of nuclear fuel buyers around the world,” said Tom Gitsel, chief executive of Canadian uranium miner Cameco, talking through the company’s first half results in June. He pointed out that “the global nuclear industry relies on Russia for approximately 14% of uranium concentrates, 7% of conversion supply and 39% of enrichment capacity”.",
            "Phillipe Knoche, chief executive of state-backed French nuclear front-end company Orano, in his company’s half-year presentation on 29 July, was keen to stress that the nuclear industry was relatively immune to short-term shocks. Knoche said there was, “no strong disruption of the market,” noting that uranium and nuclear fuel buyers do not revisit their contracts every half year or year, instead relying on longer-term contracts, so they have some flexibility in when to return to the market.",
            "The Russian invasion has shaken the market at a time when it was already changing. Even before that event there was “an unprecedented global realignment occurring in the global nuclear fuel cycle,” Gitsel said. He said that in his markets, “durability” – the visibility of a robust future pipeline of orders – was better than he had ever seen it. He put that down to three continuing factors: Net Zero targets (which he said now cover 90% of the global population); the ongoing need to lift a third of the world’s population out of ‘energy poverty’; and the need to grow power grids and provide users with consistent, baseload power. Nuclear is at the “centre of that triangle,” he said.",
            "But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has fundamentally changed even those major drivers of nuclear development. Many countries now have to manage those requirements and move beyond the current energy crises: “pivoting away from Russian energy without jeopardising those NZ commitments”. Gitsel described it as a wake-up call for some countries which had been too focused on one part of the triangle: “Net Zero made them forget about providing baseload and power security. They have been left relying on Russian energy supplies.”",
            "Gitsel was confident about growth in the long- and medium-term future of nuclear, but he was cautious about whether the conditions were in place for more uranium extraction. Instead, it is likely to be slow to respond to rising demand.",
            "“For some time now we have said that the uranium market is as vulnerable to a supply shock as it has ever been, due to persistently low prices,” Gitsel explained.",
            "He referred to supply curtailments in existing productive capacity, along with a lack of new developments, at a time when deepening geopolitical and origin risk – due to concentration of supply and regionalisation – are affecting the availability of critical minerals. What is more, the industry no longer has a stock of secondary supplies that it could rely on to fill the gaps in the past.",
            "All these internal factors suggest pressure for expansion from uranium suppliers, now potentially boosted by some countries’ wish to move away from Russian supply. But Gitsel for one said Cameco would “maintain discipline” in any expansion of capacity, not taking major investment steps until the company has long-term contracts signed with customers. The industry is also facing external pressures such as covid and inflation, which are interrupting flow of goods and services in the uranium market and increasing costs.",
            "Kazatomprom similarly noted that expanding the supply side was a process that takes a year or more, but in a market statement at the end of June, it highlighted one source of extra capacity. It described plans approved by Boss Energy to restart development at the Honeymoon project in South Australia as “a notable supply-side highlight”. Boss raised A$125m (US$87m) earlier this year to fund the restart. It expects Honeymoon to resume production late next year and ramp up to steady-state production of some 2.45 million pounds of U3O8 per year within three years.",
            "The pressure on uranium supplies has also attracted the interest of commodities traders who are purchasing significant volumes of uranium and sequestering it. Two have been active in the spot market: Yellowcake PLC was set up in 2018 “to provide investors with exposure to the uranium commodity at a time when the supply/demand fundamentals strongly suggested a resurgence in uranium prices”. It holds physical uranium oxide in storage accounts at Cameco’s Port Hope/Blind River facility in Ontario, Canada, and in Orano Cycle’s Malvési/Tricastin storage facility in France. Meanwhile, precious metal and real asset investment company Sprott also launched a trust in 2021 to buy and hold physical uranium oxide, alongside its other trusts focusing on precious metals. Both Sprott and Yellowcake have been acquiring uranium on the assumption that its value will increase.",
            "These new players have helped create volatility in uranium spot prices and so has Russia’s action: Kazatomprom said market participants’ concerns about security of supply in light of the Russia-Ukraine conflict drove up the spot price initially.",
            "Prices drifted downwards until June, when concerns about delays in a Russian delivery from St. Petersburg pushed the average spot price back up.",
            "The companies say little of that volatility will pass through to contracts. Both Orano and Cameco stressed that they have little exposure to spot prices, as instead they are focusing on long-term contracts. Kazatomprom said its contract portfolio pricing “correlates closely to uranium spot prices” but time lags between contract and delivery, as well as elements of long-term pricing in the contracts, meant it achieved prices below current spot market levels. Orano’s Knoche also noted that “some clients have several years of fissile material stored.“",
            "Uranium companies are more concerned about the delivery of uranium than about volumes of supply.",
            "Kazatomprom said, “transportation challenges were highlighted throughout the first half of 2022 due to many nations’ and companies’ efforts to reduce transactions with and decrease reliance on Russia, in light of Russia’s actions in Ukraine.” It noted that Canada’s revision to its Special Economic Measures on Russia resulted in shipping delays for a Russian enriched uranium product (EUP) delivery that was destined for the United States. The modified Canadian rules “could be interpreted to mean the Canadian company CIS Navigation and its carrier, Atlantic Ro-Ro Carriers, would be unable to transport Russian EUP from the port of St Petersburg to three American utilities aboard its Canadian-owned vessel.” That shipment won temporary exemption from the new rules and Kazatomprom believes the exemption will be in place for a year.",
            "The new Canadian rules would not affect Kazatomprom’s deliveries of uranium oxide, the company said. But it added that “a significant proportion of the company’s products are exported on a well-established primary route through Russia to the Port of St. Petersburg, which presents a specific set of risks associated with transit through the territory of Russia, shipping insurance, and the delivery of cargo by sea vessels.” The company said it shipped its second quarter volumes via St Petersburg without any disruptions or logistical/insurance-related issues but it is monitoring the growing list of sanctions on Russia and their potential impact.",
            "Kazatomprom highlighted a Trans-Caspian route, “which has been successfully used as an alternative route since 2018,” to mitigate the risk of the primary route being unavailable. It is reinforcing transit agreements with authorities along that alternate route. It said it already has received approval to ship 3500 tonnes of uranium and has applied for an increase in order to accommodate more. Kazatomprom stressed that its product “remains of Kazakh origin through to its arrival at a western conversion facility”.",
            "Gitsel also highlighted the risk of Russia imposing export constraints and said there was uncertainty over potential shipments of uranium through Black Sea ports, which could affect shipments from central Asia. He said that “while it is still technically possible to ship through Russia, due to insurance and other issues we have decided to delay a shipment from Inkai in Kazakhstan and work with our partner to establish an alternate shipping route. This could take a long time, but we will mitigate with inventory, purchase commitments and loans.” Comeco is a joint venture partner at Inkai mine with a 40% stake.",
            "In response to the invasion, Comeco said it is “already seeing companies pivot their procurement strategies to more carefully weigh the origin risk” and in the long term that was likely to remain a concern for companies which were under scrutiny over ESG governance.",
            "Gitsel noted that in response to Russia’s invasion many countries have imposed strict economic sanctions on Russia. Energy imports that have been subject to sanctions include oil, natural gas and coal – but, so far, that has not applied to nuclear fuel. Nevertheless, he said there was uncertainty over relying on nuclear fuel coming from Russia, “whether because of sanctions or a conflict with company values”. He said that some utilities will voluntarily pivot away from Russian fuel supplies because they recognise the incongruity with their values and key principles.",
            "“From our perspective it is not a matter of whether western countries will turn their backs on Russian fuel supplies, but when and how quickly,” he said.",
            "Russian fuel supplier TVEL claims 17% of the world fuel market, with fuel customers in 11 countries as well as in Russia. TVEL lists customers in Finland (two units), the Czech Republic (six units), Hungary (four units), Slovakia (four units), Bulgaria (two units), Armenia (one unit), Ukraine (nine units), Belarus (one unit), China (two units), India (two units) and what it calls ‘Western Europe’ (three units).",
            "Russia continues to make fuel deliveries – this year it sent batches to Kudankulam – but some customers are leaking away. At the time of the invasion six units in Ukraine – South Ukraine 2 and 3 and Zaporizhzhia 1, 3, 4 and 5 – were already testing Westinghouse-supplied VVER1000 fuel. Sweden has also cancelled Russian uranium supply contracts. Slovakia took a delivery of fresh fuel from Russia shortly after the February invasion, at the start of March, and said it has enough nuclear fuel for its two power stations for the entire year and some of next year. Russia’s TVEL has been the country’s sole supplier but Westinghouse was in competition to supply fuel for Mochovce in a procurement exercise in 2018. TVEL was said to have won the contract on cost.",
            "Czech state-controlled utility ČEZ said it has fuel assemblies for approximately two years of operation at Temelín while the stock at the Dukovany plant is even higher. “We decided to increase the stockpile volume at both nuclear power plants in 2016. Thanks to this, we have enough assemblies at Dukovany for approximately three years of operation of all the units. Of course, we continue to think about the diversification of suppliers,” said Bohdan Zronek, a member of the Board of Directors and Director of the Nuclear Power Division.",
            "In June ČEZ confirmed it has signed agreements with US- based Westinghouse Electric and France’s Framatome for the supply of fuel assemblies for the Temelín nuclear power station under a new 15-year contract.",
            "According to ČEZ, the new fuel deliveries will begin to fully replace TVEL as fuel supplier in 2024. During the supplier transition Westinghouse said it will supply modified Robust Westinghouse Fuel Assemblies (RWFA), a new design that is compatible with non-Westinghouse fuel.",
            "Westinghouse-made lead fuel assemblies have been in operation in the reactor core of Temelín 1 since 2019. Tarik Choho, President of EMEA Operating Plant Services at Westinghouse said the company, “has developed and supplied for many years our own VVER fuel designs for both the VVER 1000 and the VVER 440 types of reactors. We are extremely happy that our successful experience in supplying VVER fuel is going to benefit ČEZ”.",
            "What is the overall message from this mix of factors affecting the front end of nuclear’s fuel-cycle? A year ago the issues seemed clear, even if there were several potential outcomes. The urgent need to reduce carbon emissions and electrify new sectors of the economy presented a great opportunity for the nuclear industry. New-build had more urgency in some western countries and was under debate in some where it had been off the table for decades. What is more, interest in countries that had not previously had nuclear was building, with an institutional framework being set up or strengthened and in some cases site investigations. Some projects that had been in discussion for decades, such as Akkuyu in Turkey, were actually becoming a reality.",
            "Front end companies were ready to respond to that changing landscape. They were making initial investments to allow them to expand their facilities and activities – albeit that they were waiting for long-term contracts from customers before stepping up that investment.",
            "All that remains the case. But the ground has been shifted by Russia’s aggression in Ukraine. It is a world- changing event that will have effects in the short, medium and far term.",
            "The global nature of the fuel supply chain, and nuclear operators’ extremely cautious approach to securing fuel supplies, have so far meant the system has absorbed the shock in the short term.",
            "The medium term may see a shift towards western suppliers. Nuclear fuel will remain an important industry for Russia, but western competitors may well see an opportunity for a market share grab by stepping in.",
            "The long-term future of Russia’s fuel supply business is closely linked to its reactor supply and build business. Both are important industries nationally. How much of that new- build business will remain, will depend on Russia’s ability to continue to provide funding alongside hardware for emerging nuclear industries, and that is a geopolitical and financial issue that will emerge as the end game in Ukraine is played out. The long-term implications are unlikely to be clear this year – or even next.",

        "title": "Back-up power restored at Zaporizhzhia NPP",
        "text": [
            "Ukrainian engineers have managed to restore back-up power to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), a much-needed development after the plant lost all access to external electricity twice over the past week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on 14 October.",
            "The availability of back-up off-site electricity through the switchyard of the nearby thermal power station provides Europe’s largest nuclear power plant with a buffer if the connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line were to be cut again, he said.",
            "When the ZNPP’s connection to the high-voltage line was temporarily cut on 8 October and again on 12 October due to damage caused by shelling, the plant had to rely on its emergency diesel generators for electricity until the line was restored. In recent days, two of the ZNPP’s back-up power lines – connecting it to the thermal power plant switchyards – have been repaired, the IAEA team at the site reported to Agency headquarters. Today, one of the 330 kV external lines connecting the switchyard of the thermal power plant to the grid was also restored, enabling the plant to receive electricity that way, if needed.",
            "“Working in very challenging conditions, operating staff at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant are doing everything they can to bolster its fragile off-site power situation. Restoring the back-up power connection is a positive step in this regard, even though the overall nuclear safety and security situation remains precarious,” Grossi said.",
            "Before the conflict, the ZNPP had access to the grid through four high-voltage power lines, but three of them have fallen victim to shelling. The back-up power lines – offering indirect access to the electricity grid – had also been down in recent weeks. A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety, also with the six reactors in a shutdown mode. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that Grossi outlined at the beginning of the conflict.",
            "The IAEA team also said further preparatory activities to restart reactor unit 5 were continuing, and that work to also restart unit 6 was expected to get under way tomorrow. Restart will take a number of days.",
            "Separately, the ZNPP has received additional fuel supplies for its 20 diesel generators, following the arrival of seven trucks, of which five recently came from the city of Zaporizhzhia, and two earlier from Russian-controlled territory, the IAEA team said. The plant currently has fuel for at least ten days operation of diesel should external power be lost.",
            "Director General Grossi has in recent weeks engaged in high-level consultations with Ukraine and Russia aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible, stressing it is urgently needed to help prevent a nuclear accident. The consultations are progressing.",
            "On 14 October, Grossi tweeted: “Arriving in Poland on the night train from #Ukraine after an intensive week of consultations with Russia & Ukraine. Moving closer to the establishment of a protection zone for #Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant — the plant's situation is untenable and we need immediate action to protect it.”",
            "Meanwhile, the Head of the plant operators’ town of Energodar, Alexander Volga, said on 14 October that ZNPP now operates according to Russian standards. He added that ZNPP had become a part of the Russian company Rosenergoatom and now come under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. Volga added that salaries would now be paid by Russia and not by Energoatom. Earlier, Rosenergoatom CEO Renat Karchaa said that ZNPP will also eventually switch back to using Russian fuel rather than fuel supplied by Westinghouse.",
            "This followed the formal annexation of Zaporozhye region by Russia following a referendum in the territory that supported the development with a large majority. However, the US, Europe and Ukraine refuse to recognise the result of the referendum and Ukraine’s Energoatom continues to claim ownership of the plant. Grossi has also made clear that the IAEA cannot recognise Russia’s annexation.",
            "On 14 October, a team from 5-TV.ru produced a report after filming inside ZNPP. \"We are the first film crew to work inside the station, directly in the engine room. And we can see that nothing is mined here. There is no military equipment or weapons either. Only employees work, \" Izvestia correspondent Mary Badunts reported. However, the report noted: “Entering the checkpoint of the enterprise, you can immediately notice that an important infrastructural object is under heavy protection of the military and Rosgvardiya.”",

        "text": [
            "US Georgia Power has announced that fuel load into the reactor core at unit 3 of the Vogtle NPP is underway, marking “a milestone toward start-up and commercial operation of the first new nuclear units to be built in the US in more than three decades”.",
            "Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power, noted: \"The Vogtle 3&4 nuclear units represent a critical, long-term investment in our state's energy future, and the milestone of loading fuel for unit 3 demonstrates the steady and evident progress at the nuclear expansion site. We're making history here in Georgia and the US as we approach bringing online the first new nuclear unit to be built in the country in over 30 years. These units are important to building the future of energy and will serve as clean, emission-free sources of energy for Georgians for the next 60 to 80 years.\"",
            "The start of unit 3 fuel load comes after Southern Nuclear received a historic 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in August which signified that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined Licence and NRC regulations.",
            "During fuel load, nuclear technicians and operators from Westinghouse and Southern Nuclear are scheduled to transfer 157 fuel assemblies one-by-one from the unit 3 storage pool to the reactor core. Start-up testing will begin next and is designed to demonstrate the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Operators will also bring the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronise the unit to the electric grid and systematically raise power to 100%.",
            "Southern Nuclear will operate the new unit on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities. Oglethorpe Power President and CEO Michael L Smith noted: \"Oglethorpe Power and our member cooperatives commend the dedicated workforce at Plant Vogtle for their tireless efforts to reach this significant achievement. This great news means we are one step closer to bringing Unit 3 online to deliver emission-free, reliable baseload energy for EMC consumers for the next 60 to 80 years.\"",
            "Georgia approved the Vogtle expansion in 2009 and the Georgia Public Service Commission approved the new reactors in 2012.At that time, the two 1,117MWe Westinghouse AP1000 reactors were expected to cost about $14 billion and to enter service in 2016 and 2017. Construction of Vogtle 3 began in March 2013 and unit 4 the following November",
            "Analysts estimate total costs, including financing, have now increased to more than $30 billion following delays related to the 2011 Fukushima accident in Japan, the 2017 bankruptcy of former contractor Westinghouse, and the coronavirus pandemic. NRC’s approval to begin fuel loading had been delayed because much of the reactor's wiring had to be redone after federal regulators found major flaws. Southern Co also fell behind on inspection documents that had to be completed before the NRC could sign off. Unit 3 is now projected to enter commercial service in the first quarter of 2023, with an in-service target date for unit 4 by the end of that year.",

            "Nuclear Power Plant in Slovenia, operating company NEK has announced. All overhaul works, involving some 45,000 activities, is expected to last a month, are managed and supervised by NEK employees in cooperation with external contractors from Slovenia and Croatia and contractors of specific works in the nuclear industry from the international environment, NEK said. More than 2,100 people enter the plant every day and more than 1,500 people work there during peak hours.",
            "The Krško plant, a 696MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor, is jointly owned by Slovenia and Croatia, both of which were parts of the former Yugoslavia when Krško began operation in 1981. It supplies some 40% of Slovenia's. An inter-state agreement regulates the status and other legal relationships related to investment in the NPP, its exploitation and decommissioning, as well as a Company Agreement between GEN energija and HEP (Croatian Elektroprivreda). It is organised as a limited liability company.",
            "During the shutdown, all 121 fuel elements, which have been in place since the last overhaul in 2021, will be moved to a pool in the fuel handling building, where they will be inspected. This will be followed by filling the core for the next fuel cycle, where 56 fuel elements will be replaced with fresh ones.",
            "Other technological updates are underway, NEK said, among them the replacement of the high-pressure turbine, which is part of the secondary system of the power plant and is the last original component on the turbine-generator-exciter shaft. One of the more prominent activities during this shift was the lifting and removal of the 60-ton rotor. Over 40 years, it performed 28 billion operations and contributed to the production of more than 200GWe. The turbine replacement will increase Krsko's power output by 10-12MWe.",
            "The overhaul is also preparing Krško for a periodic safety assessment planned for next year with the aim of extending its operating life for a further 10 years to 2033. NEK is also considering an additional 10 years of operation to 2043. An environmental impact assessment for this has already been submitted to the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning.",
            "Krško is a Westinghouse pressurised water reactor located on the Sava River. It is unusual in being jointly owned by two countries: Slovenia, where it is located, and Croatia, both of which were parts of the former Yugoslavia when Krško came online in 1981. It supplies as much as 40% of Slovenia's electricity and has operated reliably, having three times completed uninterrupted runs of 500 days of power generation including immediately before this outage.",
            "Before the outage, an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Emergency Preparedness Review (EPREV) team of experts concluded a five-day follow-up mission to review the emergency preparedness and response framework for nuclear and radiological emergencies in Slovenia. The review was requested by the Slovenian Government and hosted by the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (SNSA) and the Administration for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief (ACPDR).",
            "The team observed a commitment at all levels to emergency preparedness and noted that Slovenia has made significant progress in developing and revising emergency arrangements since an initial EPREV mission in 2017. This full scope mission in 2017 found a sustained commitment to emergency preparedness and response (EPR) by all response organisations in Slovenia but highlighted the need to further strengthen coordination between all response organizations to ensure integrated planning.",
            "As well as the Krško NPP, Slovenia has a TRIGA research reactor and a Central Interim Storage for Radioactive Waste, both located at the Podgorica Reactor Centreand uses ionising radiation for industrial, medical and research purposes.",
            "David Nodwell, former Director of Emergency Management at the Ontario, Canada Office of the Fire Marshal and Emergency Management, led the six-person review team, which included experts from Bulgaria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and one IAEA staff member.",
            "“We commend the responsiveness of Slovenia and tremendous amount of work done since the initial review, particularly given that much of this progress was accomplished during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Nodwell said. “Especially noteworthy is the development of the national protection strategy, the amendments to the relevant national regulations and the draft National Emergency Plan. Slovenia has also upgraded their training programme, exercises and procedures for public communication.”",
            "The EPREV team identified several strengths during the mission, including:",
            "The National Emergency Response Plan was comprehensively reviewed and updated with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders in a coordinated manner.",
            "The national protection strategy is closely aligned with IAEA safety standards.",
            "The Radiation Monitoring Programme has been enhanced to support the implementation of the national protection strategy.",
            "Exercise and training programmes were further developed and are being conducted.",
            "The team also made suggestions to further strengthen EPR arrangements, including:",
            "Finalising arrangements for the termination of an emergency.",
            "Amending emergency plans of response organisations at all levels to align with the revised National Emergency Response Plan.",
            "Coordination and integration of safety and security aspects of the response to a nuclear emergency.",
            "Implementing a comprehensive quality management programme in all emergency response organisations.",
            "“Among the activities undertaken to address the recommendations from the initial EPREV mission in 2017, the most important one was the endorsement of the national protection strategy for nuclear and radiological emergencies,” said Igor Sirc, Director of the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration. “Efforts to implement the recommendations of the initial mission, culminating in the EPREV follow-up mission this year, have strengthened the emergency preparedness and response arrangements in Slovenia.”",

        "text": [
            "Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Renewable Partners, together with its institutional partners (the consortium), are forming a strategic partnership to acquire Westinghouse Electric Company. Brookfield Renewable, with its institutional partners, will own a 51% interest in Westinghouse and Cameco will own 49%.",
            "Bringing together Cameco’s expertise in the nuclear industry with Brookfield Renewable’s expertise in clean energy positions nuclear power at the heart of the energy transition and creates a powerful platform for strategic growth across the nuclear sector, a statement said.",
            "The total enterprise value for Westinghouse is $7.875 billion. Westinghouse’s existing debt structure will remain in place, leaving an estimated $4.5 billion equity cost to the consortium, subject to closing adjustments. This equity cost will be shared proportionately between Brookfield and its institutional partners (approximately $2.3 billion) and Cameco (approximately $2.2 billion).",
            "Brookfield Renewable is pursuing this opportunity through the Brookfield Global Transition Fund I (BGTF I), which is the largest fund in the world focused on the energy transition. Brookfield Renewable, which has significant available liquidity, expects to invest approximately $750 million to acquire an approximate 17% interest in Westinghouse, which will be funded through normal course funding initiatives, including asset level up-financings and asset recycling. Brookfield Renewable is among the world’s largest investors in clean energy and transition assets, with approximately 125,000MWe of operating and development capacity worldwide.",
            "Cameco currently has available liquidity and committed financing facilities for the purposes of supporting the transaction to acquire a 49% share in Westinghouse. However, Cameco will be pursuing a permanent financing mix of capital sources (cash, debt and equity), designed to preserve the company’s balance sheet and ratings strength while maintaining its liquidity, prior to closing.",
            "Cameco is also one of the largest global suppliers of uranium fuel for nuclear energy, with extensive uranium mining and milling operations, as well as refining and conversion facilities and Candu fuel fabrication for heavy water reactors.",
            "Westinghouse services about half the nuclear power generation sector and is the original equipment manufacturer to more than half the global nuclear reactor fleet. The company has a specialised workforce of roughly 9,000 employees. Cameco said approximately 85% of Westinghouse’s revenue has come from long-term contracted or highly recurring customer service provision with a nearly 100% customer retention rate given its comprehensive services offerings and position as an original equipment manufacturer, providing stability in all macroeconomic environments.",
            "“With strong growth projected in the nuclear energy market, Westinghouse is well positioned to increase business in its core fuel and services segments, execute on the growing pipeline for extending and uprating nuclear power plants, and service the rising demand for new utility-scale and modular baseload nuclear power generation,”",
            "Cameco and Brookfield Renewable say they are well placed to build a global player in the clean-energy transition. The acquisition is expected to align Cameco’s uranium production and fuel services capabilities with Westinghouse’s downstream capabilities to potentially offer utilities a highly competitive nuclear fuel solution to deliver value for existing and new customers. “This could include offering customers more efficient access to fuel supplies sourced in North America and Europe.”",
            "Tim Gitzel, President and CEO of Cameco, said: “We’re witnessing some of the best market fundamentals we’ve ever seen in the nuclear energy sector. As one of the few forms of electricity generation capable of safely, reliably and affordably producing emissions-free, baseload power, nuclear energy is becoming increasingly important in a world that prioritises electrification, decarbonisation and energy security. The opportunity to partner with Brookfield Renewable, a leader in the clean-energy space, to acquire Westinghouse is expected to create a platform for growth across the nuclear value chain.” He added: “We expect the recurring demand for Westinghouse’s operating plant services and nuclear fuel will generate a strong revenue stream and add stable cash flow to complement Cameco’s existing uranium and fuel services business.”",
            "The consortium partners see several major external trends that are expected to benefit the acquisition of Westinghouse, including:",
            "Critical transition technology: Nuclear power is the one of the only zero-emission, baseload sources of electricity currently available at scale. An estimated 400 GW of additional nuclear capacity will be needed by 2050.",
            "Accelerating growth plans: Nuclear power is experiencing a resurgence around the world with more than 20 countries across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia pursuing new projects or plant extensions. More than 50 GW of plant extensions have been announced to date and more than 60 GW of new-build reactors are expected between 2020-2040.",
            "Energy security: Energy supply chains are coming under stress as a result of geopolitical uncertainty. In the short-term, the transaction provides the opportunity to win new business supporting dozens of nuclear facilities across Eastern European countries traditionally served by Russia.",
            "Technology advancements: There are multi-decade growth opportunities in the rollout of next-generation advanced nuclear technology and long-term nuclear energy storage solutions. Modular baseload generation, such as Westinghouse’s eVinci micro-reactor technology, can play a growing role in an increasingly decentralised and decarbonised energy system.",
            "Westinghouse has several key business lines: operating plant services; nuclear fuel; long-term contracting for the manufacturing and installation of fuel assemblies and other ancillary equipment across multiple light water reactor technologies; energy systems: designing, engineering and supporting the development of new nuclear reactors; environmental services to government and commercial customers.",
            "The transaction follows the turnaround of Westinghouse by Brookfield Business Partners (BBU) – the industrials and services business of Brookfield Asset Management – which acquired the business in 2018. Brookfield invested $1bn in equity to acquire Westinghouse after it went into bankruptcy in 2017 amid large cost overruns at projects in Georgia, pictured, and South Carolina. Under BBU’s ownership Westinghouse refocused on core nuclear services, reduced its operating cost base and pursued several complementary M&A transactions to strengthen its in-house expertise.",
            "This transaction was unanimously approved by the independent directors of Brookfield Renewable based, in part, on the recommendation of a committee of independent directors, which received an opinion as to the financial fairness of the consideration from Greenhill & Co Canada Ltd, as independent financial advisor, as well as advice from independent legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co and CIBC Capital Markets are acting as financial advisors to Cameco.",
            "The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2023.",
            "Westinghouse has a long, and somewhat chequered history. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation was an American manufacturing company founded in 1886 by George Westinghouse Early on, Westinghouse was a rival to Thomas Edison's electric company. In 1892, Edison was merged with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, making an even bigger competitor, General Electric. It was originally named \"Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company”, and was renamed \"Westinghouse Electric Corporation\" in 1945.",
            "In 1990, Westinghouse experienced a financial catastrophe losing more than $1 billion due to bad high-risk, high-fee, high-interest loans made by its Westinghouse Credit Corporation lending arm.",
            "Westinghouse purchased CBS Inc in 1995 and Westinghouse Electric Corporation changed its name to and became the original \"CBS Corporation\" in 1997. That same year, the Power Generation Business Unit, headquartered in Florida, was sold to Siemens of Germany. A year later, CBS sold all of its commercial nuclear power businesses to British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) and certain rights to use the Westinghouse trademarks were granted to the newly formed BNFL subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric Company. That company was sold to Japan's Toshiba in 2006.",
            "Westinghouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with US courts in March 2017 in the face of extensive financial difficulties. The filing affected only its US operations, which included projects to build four AP1000 reactors – two each at Vogtle in Georgia, and the VC Summer site in South Carolina. In 2018, Brookfield Business Partners (together with institutional partners collectively known as Brookfield) announced that it had agreed to acquire 100% of Westinghouse from Toshiba for about $4.6 billion. Brookfield completed the purchase in August 2018, marking Westinghouse's exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as a restructured company."

        "title": "Situation at Zaporizhzhia NPP remains “fragile”",
        "text": [
            "External power has been restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP), a few hours after its connection to the grid was cut for a second time in less than a week, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.",
            "The IAEA team of experts present at the ZNPP said the plant’s connection to its last remaining operating 750 kilovolt (kV) power line was re-established around 1:40pm local time, enabling the plant to switch off the diesel generators that had been providing the reactors with electricity after the off-site power was lost in the morning.",
            "Director General Grossi welcomed the restoration of external power but stressed that the power situation at the ZNPP, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, remained very fragile. Ukraine’s national nuclear operator Energoatom earlier said shelling had caused the off-site power loss by damaging a sub-station – part of the grid’s electrical transmission and distribution system – located far from the plant itself. On 8 October, the ZNPP’s external power connection was cut due to renewed shelling near the plant but was repaired the following day. The plant’s diesel generators have fuel for about 10 days.",
            "The plant’s six reactors are in cold shutdown but still require power for cooling and other essential nuclear safety and security functions.",
            "A secure off-site power supply from the grid is essential for ensuring nuclear safety. This requirement is among the seven indispensable nuclear safety and security pillars that the Director General outlined at the beginning of the conflict.",
            "According to local press reports, IAEA representatives at ZNPP have access to all the data about its work. Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Main Council of the Zaporizhia region Administration said a new group of four IAEA experts had arrived at the plant to relieve the two who had been there since early September. They include citizens of Ireland, Canada, Lithuania and Slovakia.",
            "However, the status of the plant remains in contention, although Russia has now formally annexed the territory where the plant is sited following a referendum, which saw a majority supporting that development. On 5 October, Putin ordered the transfer of the ZNPP to Russian management, and on 8 October, the Russian government ordered the creation of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise Zaporizhia NPP to run the plant. The adviser to the General Director of Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom, Renat Karchaa said that the new head of ZNPP, Oleg Romanenko, is already at the station and has begun to perform his duties. On the other hand, Ukraine’s Energoatom continues to claim ownership of the plant and Energoatom Director General Petro Kotin has appointed himself as director of the facility.",
            "This followed the expulsion to Ukrainian controlled territory of former ZNPP Director Ihor Murashov on 3 October after he was temporarily detained by Russian forces and admitted to passing information about the plant to Ukrainian intelligence services. Since then, Valery Martynyuk, the plant’s Deputy General for Personnel Management was dismissed on 11 October for reportedly systematically persuading qualified staff to leave for work in Ukraine. He also is accused of passing personal data of employees to the Ukrainian special services including assessments of their loyalty to Russia.",
            "Meanwhile, Vladimir Rogov and other local officials including Acting Governor of the region, Yevgeny Balitsky, said there are no plans to restart the reactors of the nuclear power plant in the near future. Alexey Anpilogov, president of the Foundation for Support of Scientific Research and Development of Civil Initiatives \"Osnovanie\", an expert in the field of nuclear energy, told Vzglyad newspaper also believes that the return of ZNPP to the Russian energy system will not be fast. \"At the moment, the NPP operates as an energy island, without any connections to the system, which are destroyed by regular Ukrainian shelling. Secondly, the integration process will not be easy, because the plant's capacity will be excessive for those regions that are now part of the Russian Federation, and even for the Crimea, which it supplied earlier. This is because half of the capacity that the NPP supplied was used in the large industrial area – Donetsk-Pridneprovsky. So far, the cities that are part of this economic region are cut off from the station.\"",
            "Rosenergoatom said that ZNPP cannot yet be connected to the Russian energy system. Zaporizhzhia NPP currently does not have the technical capabilities to connect to the Russian energy system, Renat Karchaa, adviser to the General Director of the Rosenergoatom, told TASS on 11 October. According to Karchaa, experts are currently analysing the real state of the NPP and all the technical conditions related to ensuring its operation.",
            "On 12 October, Rosatom Director Alexey Likhachev told Interfax that several units at ZNPP were using US Westinghouse fuel and said these would eventually be converted back to using Russian fuel, although he gave no timeline. \"This is a purely technological issue, not a political one …. We make the best fuel for the VVER reactor, \" he said.",
            "According to Alexey Anpilogov, the American fuel used at ZNPP will most likely not be removed until the end of its operational life. He said Westinghouse had copied the design of Soviet fuel but made several technical changes. “Moreover, these changes were unauthorised, they were not agreed with the manufacturer. As a result, many companies that support the operation of the plant have withdrawn their guarantees from ZNPP,\" he added.",
            "He explained that this related to the geometric parameters of the fuel design and the percentage of uranium enrichment. Westinghouse increased the fuel's uranium enrichment by 0.5-0.7% compared with the Russian standard. This enabled the fuel to last longer. So, Westinghouse fuel burns for up to 18 months, while Russian fuel burns out for 12 months. “However, there is a danger here: when the fuel is not balanced in terms of the percentage of uranium content, then more effective cooling is also needed – there is more fuel, it burns more intensively.\" As a result the fuel elements overheated, changing the geometry of the fuel assemblies themselves and they began to \"wedge\" in the core, he explained.",
            "This happened, for example, at the Czech Temelin nuclear power plant, after which the management decided to abandon Westinghouse fuel. The same problem was initially faced by Ukraine, “but Westinghouse managed to convince them that this fuel is cheaper to operate, although it is actually more expensive”. Initially this led to a series of accidents after which Westinghouse slightly lowered the percentage of enrichment in fuel and adjusted the cooling system “to ensure that American fuel worked more or less steadily”, he explained. However, before starting to use Russian fuel again, it will be necessary to re-configure the plant, he said.",
            "On 11 October, consultations were held in St Petersburg between the Russian Federation and the IAEA on issues of cooperation in ensuring the safety of ZNPP. The Russian delegation was headed by the Rosatom General Director Alexey Likhachev and the IAEA delegation by Grossi. The Russian delegation included the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to International Organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, the head of regulator Rostekhnadzor Alexander Trembitsky, Head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Troops of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Igor Kirillov and the head of the Main Directorate for the Protection of Objects of the Russian Guard Vladimir Mashevsky.",
            "In preparation for the meeting of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Grossi discussed “issues of interaction between the Russian Federation and the IAEA in ensuring the safety of the Zaporozhye NPP”. In particular, they discussed possible approaches to the implementation of the initiative to create a Nuclear Security Protection Zone around the Zaporizhzhia NPP. Rosatom said: “There is an understanding of the need to continue discussions.”",
            "Putin noted: “Today, there are elements of excessive and dangerous politicisation of everything related to nuclear activities. But we very much hope that – and thanks to your efforts – we will be able to reduce all the rhetoric in this regard, bring this area of our activity and cooperation to a normal state, despite all the turbulence and complex processes that are taking place on the world stage.” He added: “We are very glad to see you and will be happy to discuss all the issues that we are mutually interested in, and perhaps even cause some concern…. In any case, we are open to this dialogue and are glad to see you.”",
            "Last week, Grossi met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv and they are expected to meet there again following the discussions with Putin in St Petersburg. \"The situation in the region around the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and elsewhere has become increasingly dangerous, precarious and challenging, with frequent military attacks that can also threaten nuclear safety and security,\" Grossi said. \"Now more than ever, during these extremely difficult times, a protection zone must be established around the ZNPP. We can’t afford to lose any more time.”",

            "The small size allows for standard transportation methods and rapid, on-site deployment while the reactor core is designed to run for three or more years, eliminating the need for frequent refuelling. The key benefits of the micro reactor are attributed to its solid core and advanced heat pipes. The heat pipes enable passive core heat extraction, allowing autonomous operation and inherent load following capabilities. The eVinci micro reactor is designed for government usage allowing for mobile operations utilising standard military transportation vehicles and containers. The nature of the design will allow the reactor to be rapidly transported to sites as needed to create an abundant and resilient power supply to support advanced defence systems.",

            "Westinghouse Electric Company and Ansaldo Nucleare have signed a cooperation agreement to develop a next-generation NPP based on Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) technology. The two companies will advance a common design to maximise synergies, combine experience in design, testing and licensing, and align respective partner and supply chain organisations. Westinghouse said the agreement builds upon development activities already underway in the UK, USA, Italy, and Romania, where more than ten state-of-the-art, lead-based test facilities are being installed.",
            "LFR technology combines the use of liquid lead as a coolant, high-temperature operation, and fast neutron spectrum with engineering solutions promoting design simplicity and robustness. “The objective is step change performance improvement relative to traditional nuclear technology, including enhanced economics, market versatility beyond electricity and improved sustainability,” Westinghouse noted.",
            "“Ansaldo Nucleare shares a common vision with Westinghouse,” said Dr Roberto Adinolfi, Ansaldo Nucleare’s Chairman. “Ansaldo has strongly believed and invested in LFR technology since the beginning of the century, and we are eager to start another journey of collaboration with Westinghouse toward its deployment.”",
            "“The joint work we have accomplished already will serve as a springboard to accelerate LFR technology development,” said Dr Rita Baranwal, Chief Technology Officer of Westinghouse. “We are developing an economically competitive, versatile and sustainable nuclear power plant which will be deployed to accommodate the needs of diverse communities and evolving energy markets, including district heating, hydrogen generation, and water desalination.”",
            "Ansaldo Nucleare has coordinated Euratom’s project ELSY (European Lead cooled SYstem) since its beginning in 2006. The project goal was the development of an innovative pre-conceptual design of an industrial lead-cooled fast reactor for electricity production based on a closed fuel cycle for enhanced sustainability.",
            "Following ELSY completion (2010), in the frame of EU 7th framework programme, Ansaldo was appointed as leading organisation and coordinator of the LEADER project (Lead-cooled European Advanced DEmonstration Reactor). The LEADER project aimed to develop a conceptual design of a Lead Fast Reactor Industrial size plant (the European LFR – ELFR) and of a scaled demonstrator of the LFR technology called ALFRED (Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator).",
            "The main goal behind ALFRED and Lead technology development is to maintain the nuclear energy source as an important contributor to the development of a secure and low carbon European energy system. ALFRED, as one of the projects supported by the European Sustainable Nuclear Industrial Initiative (ESNII), brings together industry and research partners in the development of Generation IV Fast Neutron Reactor technology, as part of the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan. In the role of European Technology Demonstrator Reactor (ETDR), ALFRED was designed to be fully representative of an industrial size reactor, but with a reduced thermal power. ALFRED is extensively based on the use of the defence in depth criteria, enhanced by the use of passive safety systems.",
            "Our strong commitment and deep involvement in the LFR development was formalised through the signature of an unincorporated Consortium, namely FALCON (Fostering ALfred CONstruction), in Bucharest (2013). The Consortium includes Ansaldo Nucleare, ENEA and RATEN-ICN, plus CV-Rez since 2014.",

Grossi plans to visit Kiev and later the Russian Federation, where he will also continue talks aimed at agreeing and implementing a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the ZNPP as soon as possible. The six-unit ZNPP is has been held by Russian forces since March but has continued to be operated by its Ukrainian staff. It has come under massive and repeated shelling since July.",
            "IAEA also added that on 5 October, IAEA experts at the site had learned that ZNPP plans to restart one of its six reactors which are currently all in cold shutdown. Senior Ukrainian operating staff informed IAEA experts present at ZNPP that preparations are under way to start unit 5 at reduced power to produce steam and heat for the needs of the plant. It will take some time to complete all preparations, including those related to necessary systems and equipment, before reactor operations can resume. ZNPP’s last operating reactor – unit 6 – was shut down on 11 September. The IAEA team also reported that there had been shelling in an industrial area located between the ZNPP and the plant operators’ town of Energodar, but the plant site itself was not affected.",

Ukraine, the USA and Europe have refused to recognise the results of the referenda despite the presence of international observers who found no violations.",
            "Both Russia and Ukraine claim to be in control of the plant. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin on 5 October issued a presidential decree placing the ZNPP under Russian management. \"The Government of the Russian Federation should ensure that the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant and other property necessary for the implementation of its activities are taken into federal ownership,\" the decree says. The document was published on the Russian government’s official portal of legal information. The plant will be operated by Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom, a subsidiary of Rosatom, through the joint-stock company Operating Organisation of Zaporizhia NPP (AO ZNPP). It will continue to function under Ukrainian-issued licences until Russian equivalents are obtained, according to the decree. Which also defines the specifics of working with the ZNPP until 1 January2028.

Only an organisation with the appropriate experience and competencies is able to cope with such a task,” said Romanenko. “Therefore, it is no coincidence that the state has instructed the new company to ensure the stable operation of the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in compliance with all safety criteria and standards and using the impeccable experience of operating nuclear power plants in the Russian Federation.” He added: “Another task will be to normalise the situation within the team. In the near future, all employees of the NPP will be employed in the staff of the new operating organisation with the preservation of wages and social guarantees. At the same time, the plant's condition will be assessed and the damaged infrastructure restored, taking into account the experience of operating nuclear power units in Russia.\"",
            "Ukraine, for its part, has also claimed ownership of ZNPP. Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom said it “considers Putin’s ordinance and other documents issued in Russia in regard to Zaporizhzhya NPP to be void, absurd, and inadequate”. Energoatom cites a “Presidential decree of the President of Ukraine dated October 4 No. 687 ‘On the Nullity of Acts Violating the Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity of Ukraine’.” ZNPP “will keep operating in Ukraine, under Ukrainian legislation, in the Ukrainian power system, and for Energoatom”.",
            "Energoatom President Petro Kotin immediately appointed himself as Director General of ZNPP.",
            "In a speech he said: “In accordance with the current legislation, permitting and regulatory documents, I decided to assume the duties of the general director of the Zaporizhzhya NPP. The station's administration was transferred to Kyiv after the kidnapping of director general Ihor Murashov. All further decisions regarding the operation of the station will be made directly at the central office of Energoatom.”",
            "He added: “All technical issues of the operation of power units will, as before, be resolved by the technical staff of the NPP in agreement with the Company's central office, namely by acting chief engineer Yuriy Chernichuk under the leadership of acting first vice president – technical director of Energoatom Yuriy Sheik. Undoubtedly, our work, our destiny, our homes and our future are with Ukraine, as always. We will continue to work in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, in the Ukrainian energy system, in Energoatom.”",
            "Anticipating the results of the referenda, Russia’s Kommersant newspaper on 23 September looked at how this might affect the status of ZNPP. The paper quoted Dmitry Gorchakov, an independent analyst, as saying: \"The transfer of the NPP to another jurisdiction will not be recognised outside of Russia and may take years: the Russian operator and regulator need to issue new licences, conduct personnel certification, and check equipment, many of which are not certified in the Russian Federation.\"",
            "He noted that the plant consists of VVER-1000 reactors that are well-known to Russia, “but they have been operated in another country for 30 years, according to different norms and rules, and were upgraded there”. In addition, some of the reactors are loaded with fuel from the US Westinghouse, “which the Russian operator probably will not want to use, and it will take time to replace”.",
            "Gorchakov further commented: \"As a result, there may be a situation where the plant will not have legal grounds for operation: the Ukrainian nuclear supervision authority, which does not recognise the NPP as Russian, may revoke licences, and Russia will not have time to issue them yet.\" He added: “The licensing process in the Russian Federation may be delayed also because the new operator and regulator will have to take full responsibility for the operation of nuclear power plants in a war zone for the first time.”",
            "Kommersant also asked how the IAEA would respond. It cites Andrey Baklitsky, a senior researcher at the UN Institute for Disarmament Research, who warns ZNPP “will be in a gray zone, international cooperation will stop.” He noted that Grossi had created a new mechanism by stationing two representatives of the agency at the NPP as observers. \"However, so far the IAEA could use the mechanism, because Russia recognised the NPP as Ukrainian and provided access from Ukraine. If this changes, it is difficult to imagine how the IAEA Director General will be able to continue this activity,\" Baklitsky said.",
            "Certainly the opposing claims of Russia and Ukraine with respect to ZNPP must pose a headache for the IAEA. However, given Grossi’s repeated adamant statements about the need to ensure the safety of the plant, It seems certain that he will continue to try to find some sort of compromise.",

        "title": "Brookfield says nuclear is a clean, safe and mature source of power",
        "text": [
            "Canada-based global asset management company Brookfield has released a White Paper titled “A New Dawn for Nuclear Power”. It says the worldwide drive to net zero “is shining a spotlight on nuclear, a clean, safe and mature source of electricity generation”. Nuclear power “is also gaining more support from policymakers and investors given its ability to promote energy security and energy independence”. These trends are driving a global push to extend the lives and increase the capacity of existing plants, as well as build new reactors with state-of-the art designs and technologies.",
            "The 13-page report notes that the combination of increasing prices for fossil fuels, geopolitical shifts and the growing desire for energy security and energy independence is also contributing to the renewed appeal of nuclear power. “This echoes the 1970s oil crisis, following which 40% of today’s operating nuclear power plants were built. Now – after considerable upfront costs – nuclear power supplies some of the cheapest electricity in the world.”",
            "Brookfield says nuclear is also one of the safest power generation technologies globally, a distinction it will continue to hold due to the industry’s exceedingly high regulatory and safety standards. “Yet common misconceptions have caused many to overlook all that nuclear has to offer.” However, it provides access to clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy, and “given the technology advances in nuclear reactors due in the coming years, nuclear power is back in the spotlight again”.",
            "Noting the growth in renewable power sources as fossil fuels are phased out, the report points out that “these are intermittent sources of power, energy storage and clean sources of baseload power will also be necessary”. While hydropower will play an important role, “for new-build hydropower plants, the right geography can be hard to find”. However, traditional renewables will not be able to fill the clean energy gap completely.",
            "The report describes how nuclear assisted in displacing coal-fired electricity in Ontario. “In the end, Ontario added a total of 1,500 MW of nuclear, 5,500 MW of natural gas and 5,500 MW of non-hydro renewables.”",
            "Over the past 50 years, nuclear power has displaced more than 60 gigatons of CO2 emissions. Moreover, “nuclear takes advantage of the atom’s high energy density, meaning it can supply uninterruptible energy at scale”. Beyond baseload power, nuclear can also provide inertia – a type of stored energy that’s a key source of grid reliability – and many can operate flexibly, ramping up or down in response to the needs of the electrical grid.",
            "“As renewable energy increasingly dominates the energy grid, new nuclear facilities can provide critical backup. New types of reactors are increasingly dispatchable and can meet baseload demand for clean generation on a utility or distributed energy scale. For example, micro modular reactors are under development that can replace the existing diesel generation infrastructure for smaller-scale applications. And replacing old fossil fuel units, especially coal-fired ones, will also go a long way to meeting clean energy demand globally.” Finally, “nuclear could also support the shift to a hydrogen economy”.",
            "As to energy security, “The simple reality is that if a country does not have its own natural gas, nuclear energy is one of the best ways to achieve sovereignty over energy in the long run.”",
            "The White Paper concludes: “Nuclear power is riding tremendous tailwinds: Demand for clean energy is growing rapidly while the importance of energy security has assumed a central position on the world stage. Policymakers and investors are increasingly recognising nuclear’s role in reaching net zero by 2050. The future is fast approaching, and it's important to remember that progress is cumulative in science and engineering. New reactors are already building on the lessons of the past – and ushering in a new dawn for nuclear power.”",
            "Not surprisingly, the report includes a focus on Westinghouse, which is a Brookfield portfolio company. Brookfield Business Partners, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management agreed in January 2018 to buy Westinghouse from Toshiba for approximately $4.6 billion. Westinghouse had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2017 as a result of losses from the Summer and Vogtle nuclear construction projects. The company emerged from Chapter 11 in August 2018, following completion of the sale. In 2021, Brookfield sought out potential buyers for a minority stake in Westinghouse, and although there was some interest, no sale resulted. In May this year, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that Brookfield was ready to sell its entire interest in Westinghouse. The report was cited by the American Nuclear Society. It quoted Cyrus Madon, Brookfield’s CEO as saying: “Look, we’ve made many times our investment in Westinghouse. We’ve already pulled out more than our invested capital just through regular dividends. And I would say our job is sort of done here.” It remains to be seen whether this is still the case."

        "text": [
            "s EDF has said it will review whether there is a case to keep open the Hartlepool and Heysham 1 NPPs in the UK beyond their current expected closure date in 2024.",
            "EDF said it would invest GBP1 billion ($1.1 billion) over 2023-25 to help UK plants to maintain output. “Our priority in the next few years is to deliver as much output as we safely can from the existing fleet, to support security of supply and help preserve the UK’s nuclear skills,” said Matt Sykes, Managing Director of EDF’s Generation business.",
            "Currently UK operating NPPs include four stations with ageing advanced gas-cooled reactors (AGRs) at Heysham 1, Hartlepool, Torness and Heysham 2 as well as Sizewell B, which has a pressurised water reactor. Together these have a generating capacity of 5.5GWe. Heysham 1 and Hartlepool are due to close in 2024 and Torness and Heysham 2 by 2030. Three other stations with AGRs – Hunterston B, Hinkley Point B and Dungeness B have already closed and are being defuelled. Sizewell B is due to close in 2035. A new plant with EPR reactors is under construction at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.",
            "An EDF spokeswoman said: “In light of the severity of the energy crisis and the results of recent graphite inspections, EDF will look to review the case for a short extension for Heysham 1 and Hartlepool Power Stations to generate beyond the current forecast of March 2024.”",
            "This came as part of a strategy update for EDF’s UK nuclear fleet in which it said the growing energy crisis in Europe had raised concerns about security of supply “with an increasing interest in nuclear power as a fundamental part of our energy mix to provide home-grown, dependably, zero-carbon supply”.",
            "EDF said closure dates for the four AGR stations “will be determined by the condition of the graphite making up the reactor cores, which is regularly inspected, and subject to rigorous assessment by the independent regulator. Inspections provide reassurance and allow us to meet external regulations. For example, our power stations are required to meet global earthquake regulations – this means we have to prove we can shut down the reactors during a major earthquake, a 1 in 10,000 year event – much larger than the UK has ever experienced or expects to happen.”",
            "According to EDF, nuclear output was forecast to be 42TWh for 2022, whis is some 5% above target. The investment of GBP1 billion will be for maintenance, inspections and plant upgrades to help sustain output for 2023 to 2025. EDF said it will review the case to extend generation at Hartlepool and Heysham \"within the next few months\".",
            "Discussions are also underway with the UK government on a voluntary pricing mechanism for nuclear output. EDF noted that power from nuclear had been \"delivered to the market at an average realised price which is significantly below current market prices\". Stressing the importance of price stability, it said the talks aim to agree a fair price to break the link between gas and electricity prices: \"The goal is to stabilise the price of power to customer at affordable levels, while supporting a fair return on investment for the generating fleet.\"",
            "As to the future, EDF said it would “help open up our sites for developments” to support the target of reaching 24GWe of nuclear capacity by 2050 and was working on a 20-year extension for Sizewell B. Life extension work began in April and involves Westinghouse, Jacobs, Framatome and Atkins. \"Work is progressing well to complete the Technical and Safety Review by the middle of 2023 with a final investment decision to be made by EDF in 2024.\"",
            "On the construction of Hinkley Point C EDF said some 74,000 people having worked on the project across the UK, with around 8000 people on site. EDF also said it will continue to work with the UK government on a similar NPP planned for Sizewell C and that a final investment decision is due next year. EDF is also looking at possible sites for small modular reactors including Heysham, while it considers Hartlepool to be \"the most suitable site in the UK\" for High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors which could produce heat and steam for industry.",

            "Czech power company ČEZ has said that unit 3 of the Dukovany NPP has been shut down for refuelling and maintenance. The reactor will receive 90 fresh fuel cartridges and technicians will inspect the reactor pressure vessel and complete general maintenance of the two main circulation pumps.",
            "The Czech Republic has six commercially operational reactor units: four Russian designed VVER-440 units at Dukovany site, which began operation between 1985 and 1987, and two VVER-1000 units at Temelín, which began operation in 2000 and 2002. Total installed nuclear capacity is 3934MWe accounting for 32.5% of electricity generation.",
            "TVEL (part of Rosatom) has long been the fuel supplier for both NPPs but from 2024 US-based Westinghouse and the French Framatome will supply fuel for Temelin. However, as yet, only TVEL can supply fuel for VVER-440 reactors, although Westinghouse is in the process of developing such fuel. Dukovany currently has fuel supply for almost three years. \"According to the valid contract, another delivery from Russia should take place later this year,\" said plant director Roman Havlin.",
            "TVEL has been supplying Dukovany for almost 40 years and continues to develop fuel for the power plant's needs. \"If we buy it from another supplier, it does not have such a history. This means that the fuel in our country will be usable, it will be safe, but it may have a higher or lower output, we do not know,\" Havlín explained.",
            "Dana Drábová, chairwoman of the State Office for Nuclear Safety, said she did not expect it would be necessary to change fuel suppliers for the roughly 20 years of operation that remained for the Dukovany plant. She noted that TVEL produces fuel of excellent parameters. \"CEZ will have to come to terms with the fact that the fuel from the new supplier will not be optimised for performance, as was the case with the fuel from TVEL,\" said Drábová.",
            "As to maintenance, Havlin noted: \"We and our suppliers have 15,165 work orders and 47 major technical and investment actions to handle during the shutdown. It will be difficult, but we are prepared as much as possible.” As part of the shutdown, the power engineers will complete modernisation and optimisation the last cooling tower – No 8. ČEZ said this will increase production at Dukovany by around 15,539 MWh. Just a seemingly small reduction in the average temperature of the circulating cooling water by 0.35° C will increase the efficiency of the entire power plant, ČEZ explained. “These are not extremely large volumes, but a number of small measures ultimately have an effect,” said Bohdan Zronek, member of ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear power division.",

        "text": [
            "A small modular reactor (SMR) could be built in the Czech Republic at the Temelín NPP as early as 2032, Daniel Beneš, the Director of the ČEZ power group has said after signing a contract for the establishment of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park. South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba, addressing an international conference, said: \"We realise that nuclear energy is something that we fundamentally need in the republic. \"Czech industry is not only driven by renewable sources, we are not Norway, which has unlimited water capacities and produces 95% of its energy with clean hydropower plants.\"",
            "This is why it was decided to establish the South Bohemian Energy Park, using the Temelin site to build the first SMR in Europe, including an educational centre for engineers, specialists and other technical professions, he added. \"We thus have a unique opportunity to participate in the construction and development of a technical background where experts from all over Europe can be educated.\"",
            "The joint company South Bohemia Nuclear Park aims to facilitate construction of the first pilot project at Temelín which offers a protected, research space, and the presence of professional staff to ensure a synergistic effect during planning, construction and operation.",
            "This project has the support of the government, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. \"In the context of the situation in Europe, the signing of this agreement is an extremely important step. This is a landmark year, the war in Ukraine shook the international order, tested allied relations and showed the danger of dependence on resources and raw materials from risky countries,\" he noted",
            "\"Due to supply cuts, we are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of electricity and gas, a situation that threatens us and with which we must deal quickly,” he said. “The government is reacting to it with acute measures, but this is not enough, and that is why we are also working on longer-term solutions that will strengthen our energy security and independence,\" he explained, adding that it also involves building a SMR. \"These are smaller mass-produced devices that largely overcome some of the disadvantages of existing reactors. They could replace ageing power plants and heating plants,\" he concluded.",
            "Beneš emphasised that Temelin is the best possible place for the pilot project. \"At the same time, preparation for the construction of two new standard units continues. We are also working on the project of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany NPP, where we expect offers by the end of November. These buildings are not in competition with the small modular reactors we are talking about.\" He added that SMRs are complementary technologies and are more suitable for a range of different locations. \"Everything is based on the energy mix, the Czech energy mix largely relies on nuclear energy.\"",
            "In the last year, the ČEZ Group has accelerated activities related to the SMR project, having already signed memorandums of cooperation with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, KHNP and Holtec. Through its subsidiary ÚJV Řež, it is also developing SMRs locally. The HeFASTo project or the Energywell project are at an advanced stage of research and intensive cooperation is also underway with Westinghouse.",
            "\"There are seven companies in the world that deal with the preparation of such projects. We are in very active communication with all of them, we have signed memoranda of cooperation with them. They should put the first installations into operation before 2030. We have a feeling that these technologies will be ground-breaking. It makes sense to build the first pilot project next to the Temelín cooling towers.” He noted that some SMRs are almost as big as the nuclear units in Dukovany, but they are easier and faster to build than large nuclear reactors. He said the SMR in Temelín could be ready between 2032 and 2035.",
            "\"Given the current situation, we are accelerating this project. We see that it will be necessary to replace a number of coal-fired power plants and heating plants, while maintaining the maximum degree of self-sufficiency,” said Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear energy division. “SMRs are a safe and very efficient option from this point of view. \"",
            "The South Bohemian Nuclear Park is a joint project of all parties involved, covering research, development, communication and preparation of the building itself. However, an investor for the SMR has not been decided and investment costs have not yet been estimated.",

This additional activity had not been anticipated by our partners when they set their radiation limits,\" it said.",
            "Citing “two sources with direct knowledge of the repair work”, Reuters said at least one EDF contractor, the French company Monteiro, had already increased the maximum exposure to which its workers could be subjected, adding that this presented no health risk",
            "To help EDF meet the schedule, Monteiro – which supplies welders to EDF – raised the annual radiation exposure limit for its workers to 14 millisieverts from 12 previously, the sources said. This figure remains well below the French legal limit of 20 millisieverts for nuclear workers, they added.",
            "One of the sources told Reuters that workers repairing the reactors faced difficult conditions. “People are working in a restricted area, repairing 3-centimetre-wide pipes in sites no bigger than a Parisian studio. We try to make the job safe and finish the job on time, but the dangers are many,\" the source said. \"Staff have to be rotated and the problem is that this is extremely specialized work and there are a limited number of people with the required skills.\"",
            "Citing the same sources, Reuters said EDF has brought in hundreds of specialised workers, including welders and pipefitters from six French contractors, US nuclear power plant maker Westinghouse Electric Company and another US firm. One of the reasons for hiring Westinghouse is that it makes robots that do some of the welding and have no radiation exposure limits, one of the sources said.",
            "Government ministers have urged EDF to stick to its maintenance schedule and EDF expects enough reactors to be back in service by December-January to ensure nuclear output levels in line with last year. However, one of the sources said expectations that the welds on EDF's 1,450MWe Civaux 1 reactor would be completed within the next six weeks “seem unrealistic\". The source added that only six of 30 welds had been completed so far, and a seventh weld completed recently was faulty and needed to be redone.",

            "Deep rolling blackouts that have hit South Africa have prompted a reappraisal of the repair, refurbishment and maintenance programme at South Africa’s only operating nuclear power plant, Koeberg near Cape Town. The two-unit facility supplies some 5% of the nation’s electricity and they are currently the only operating reactors in South Africa as well as the African continent. While the nuclear units play a significant role in maintaining grid stability, since the start of the year only a single unit, or half the capacity, has been operating.",
            "Both Koeberg 1 and 2 are PWRs. Unit 1 began construction in 1976 and commercial operations begin in July 1984. Construction on Unit 2 also began in 1976 but commercial operations didn’t begin until just about a year later than unit 1, in November 1985. Units 1 and 2 have net capacities of 924 MWe and 930 MWe, respectively. The state-owned power utility Eskom is responsible for operating the reactors as well as maintaining them and this year both are due to be shut down as part of a planned repair and maintenance programme.",
            "The planned outage of unit 2, the 25th refuelling outage since commissioning, began on 18 January and originally had been anticipated as an outage lasting 155 days. This maintenance programme also included the replacement of the unit’s three steam generators and reactor pressure vessel head, which houses the reactor’s nuclear fuel.",
            "In March though, the company announced that, prior to the start of any irreversible work, Eskom and the main contractor Framatome (now Areva) performed a final review to ensure that the steam generator replacement work would be completed in a timely way while ensuring the quality levels of the work. However, the review concluded that there was a significant likelihood that the unit would not be returned to service before the peak demand winter season, exacerbating the challenges faced by an already constrained grid.",
            "“Before we start cutting pipes, we conducted a final review to ensure that the steam generator replacement work would be completed at the expected quality levels and in accordance with the outage schedule. It was just too risky to continue with this work,” Jan Oberholzer, Eskom’s Chief Operating Officer, explained in a statement.",
            "With the chance that the reactor may returned to the service later than the planned-for June 2022 and the severe impact on consumers and businesses if that was the case, a decision was taken to delay the steam generator element of the refurbishment until the following refuelling outage. This is currently planned for August 2023. Eskom insists that these deferred tasks in no way affect the safe operations of the plant as the steam generators undergo a full series of inspections and integrity tests as part of the standard refuelling outage. As Riedewaan Barkadien, Eskom’s Chief Nuclear Officer, later explained: “We have moved the replacement of the generators into a window that suits Eskom better”.",
            "While the first phase of the current outage proceeded as planned, including replacement of fuel and scheduled maintenance, the latest delay to the project is the second to be recently announced. Eskom laid the delays at the door of the global pandemic, which hampered the ability of the company to get resources to the site. Work on Unit 2 had initially been set for completion by mid-June. CEO André de Ruyter has said the work would now be finalised by the end of July, as NEI goes to press. Unit 2 had produced electricity for 454 days without interruption ahead of the January refuelling and maintenance shutdown.",
            "Each weighing about 380 tonnes and some 20 metres long, the steam generator replacement is an important part of a US$1.2bn longer-term programme to extend the operational life of the plant’s reactors by 20 years each. The original generators feature U-tubes that are susceptible to cracking. Once removed they will temporarily stored on-site, before final disposal at the Vaalputs radioactive waste storage facility in the Northern Cape “as complete and sealed units”. It has been reported that the on-site facilities to store the old steam generators are not ready, which is one of the reasons for the changing schedule.",
            "While the delay will not materially impact the life extension plan it does narrow the available window to complete the work. Koeberg’s current operating licences expire in 2024 for Unit 1 and 2025 for Unit 2. Steam generator replacement at both units is one of the upgrades required by the National Nuclear Regulator (NNR) to grant an extension to the operating licence. The Koeberg Long-Term Operation (LTO) plan is a series of activities that will enable Koeberg to operate to 2045. The plans are to be submitted along with supporting documentation to the NNR for evaluation and Eskom had planned to submit the required supporting documentation by June 2022.",
            "As part of the review of the Koeberg LTO programme, an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) 10-person team carried out a safety aspects of the LTO (SALTO) review during March 2022. “We observed that despite many challenges the plant has made progress in ageing management activities and preparation for safe LTO since the first Pre-SALTO mission in 2015,” said team leader Gabor Petofi, a Senior Nuclear Safety Officer at the IAEA. Koeberg management has also requested the IAEA schedule a follow-up mission to Koeberg during 2024.",
            "“Eskom has incorporated some IAEA standards and guides into its policies and procedures, with a robust framework having been put in place for the life extension,” said Barkadien.",
            "In a statement Katse Maphoto, Chief Director: Nuclear Safety and Technology of the Department of Minerals and Energy in South Africa, emphasised the importance of Koeberg LTO from national energy security and grid balancing perspective: “The government remains optimistic that the LTO project will benefit a lot from the IAEA mission recommendations for the power station to achieve the highest level of safety.” The South African government has previously indicated a strong commitment to the future of nuclear energy. Alongside the Koeberg LTO in October 2019 the country outlined plans to build 1 GW of new nuclear capacity by 2030.",
            "Koeberg unit 1 is currently scheduled to shut down for its annual refuel and maintenance programme in September and the steam generator replacement on this unit will proceed as planned from October 2022. This is after the winter peak and is planned as a similar 155-day outage. Its reactor pressure vessel head had already been replaced several years ago.",
            "Areva was the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for Koeberg and in August 2014, Eskom awarded Areva the steam generator replacement contract in a ZAR 4.3bn (US$258m) contract that was later challenged in court by Westinghouse. The installation of the replacement steam generators was originally scheduled to begin in 2018. Three of the steam generators have already been completely built and the remaining three are progressing well, Eskom says.",
            "In August last year, US-based Jacobs announced it had been selected to carry out essential engineering modifications in preparation for the installation of the six replacement steam generators. Jacobs is responsible for construction management related to modifications to the secondary steam turbine system. The scope of work includes prefabrication of piping, pipe supports and modification, and piping replacement; installation of on- site scaffolding, rigging and lagging; vessel modifications and strengthening; and replacement of forced air cooler units. About 12.6 tonnes of asbestos roof sheets and 14.1 tonnes of structural steelwork were safely removed ahead of schedule.",
            "“This project is vital to maintain the pivotal role of nuclear power in South Africa’s energy mix,” said Jacobs Energy Security and Technology Senior Vice President Karen Wiemelt, who added: “We also created a new design to install an independent seal cooling system with an independent power supply system.”",
            "In March 2017 Canada-based L3 MAPPS won a contract to upgrade two simulators at Koeberg, taking into account the changes that the new steam generators will make to the plant performance. The two simulators will switch from PC/Linux simulation servers to PC/Windows-based computers running its latest Orchid simulation environment. The reactor core model will also be replaced. In 2013, L3 MAPPS completed work to upgrade the plant’s original simulator and also commissioned the second full-scope simulator at the site. That work was carried out under contracts signed in 2009.",
            "Meanwhile, in July, it was announced that Barkadien had tendered his resignation and is to join a Canadian nuclear utility after 26 years at Eskom. A previous Koeberg Station Manager, Keith Featherstone, will be acting in the Chief Nuclear Officer role while a replacement for Barkadien is recruited. “As the only nuclear power station in Africa, we have all played a role in keeping the plant safe, and the best place to work. The decision to resign was, therefore, by no means an easy decision,” said Barkadien.",
            "In a related development, the current acting Station General Manager, Nomawethu Mtwebana, is to temporarily join the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) after the completion of the current outage of Unit 2. Mahesh Valaitham, will become Koeberg’s acting General Manager.",
            "Returning Koeberg 2 to service will help reduce pressure on the rest of the Eskom generation fleet and will mitigate the risk of further load shedding over the winter period. The increase in load shedding came on the back of higher levels of unplanned plant breakdowns, which averaged 26% of the fleet in the period ended March 2022. During this period the energy availability factor (EAF) averaged 62%.",
            "“Planned maintenance is Eskom’s only weapon to try bring reliability and predictability to a neglected plant,” Eskom’s Oberholzer said, emphasising the challenge of maintaining its large generation fleet. Indeed, during the summer months around 12% of the total generation capacity had been taken offline for planned maintenance in preparation for the peak demand winter period.",
            "The return to service of Koeberg 2 will add 930 MWe of much needed power to the South African Power system, reducing pressure on the transmission grid and limiting the need for load shedding. Until then Eskom has urged South African residents to use electricity “sparingly” especially during the morning and evening peaks, when capacity constraints require it to implement load shedding as a “last resort” to protect the national grid. Despite such measures to conserve power, due to low plant availability from 1 January to 10 May this year, load shedding has been implemented for 32 days, six more than the 26 days of load shedding that occurred during the same period in 2021."

            "Largely muted growth of new nuclear capacity across the Western world comes in sharp contrast to the East, where many nations are planning or building new plants.",
            "According to recent analysis from the World Nuclear Association (WNA), there are already 140 operable nuclear power reactors across the region, a further 30-odd are currently under construction and there are firm plans to build at least another 50 reactors.",
            "Although development across Asia is a mixed bag, reflecting the region’s diversity, there are many active markets with clear development plans. About a quarter of worldwide operational reactors are located in Asia. Of these well over 100 are within the six countries of China, Japan, South Korea, India, Pakistan and Taiwan, which field a combined capacity of close to 100 GWe.",
            "The regional nuclear power league table is led by China, which has been pushing its domestic nuclear ambitions since the 1970s. Asia is home to about two-thirds of all the reactors currently under construction worldwide. Of these, almost 20 reactors are being built in China alone, which is developing a mix of domestic and western technology. With 54 operable reactors and a total capacity of 52.2 GWe, China has another 33 reactors in the planning stage which are expected to add a further 37 GWe. Over the 10 years to the end of 2021, China built 39 rectors out of the global total of 68, increasing the national nuclear contribution by a factor of about four. China has set out plans to reach 70 GWe of nuclear capacity by the end of 2025 and between six and eight new nuclear reactors are expected to be approved each year, adding some 9 GWe annually through to 2030.",
            "Following China on the regional league table comes Japan with a technical installed capacity of more than 31 GWe from its 33 installed reactors. However, the majority of these plants remain shut down following on from the Fukushima Diiachi disaster of 2011 with the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) demanding additional safety measures be installed. Nonetheless, the country has been slow to restart even those reactors now deemed safely operable. Recently Japan’s prime minister demanded that further nine reactors be returned to service by winter. Prior to the tsunami around a third of Japan’s electricity came from nuclear and that proportion was expected to increase further as more reactors were on the cards for development. Now, plans to significantly expand nuclear capacity have been dropped, although WNA notes that two reactors are under construction with a combined capacity of 2.8 GWe and one further reactor is planned at 1.4 GWe. Even so, analysis from IHS Markit indicates Japan’s nuclear generation share will fall further, from 29% in 2020 to 22% by 2030 as reactors reach the end of their service life.",
            "The Fukushima disaster also had a stultifying effect on other nuclear ambitions across the region, prompting many nations to reappraise their development plans. Alongside Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have both seen opposition to new nuclear capacity increase over the last decade.",
            "Taiwan, for example, has three operating nuclear power plants, which produce about 10% of the island’s electricity. A fourth plant, Lungmen, was never commissioned and in December last year voters rejected the possibility of restarting construction of the two-unit mothballed facility. The current administration has a long-term policy of phasing out nuclear power by 2025.",
            "Around a quarter of South Korea’s electricity comes from nuclear and it is currently pursuing export markets for its reactor technology, having just built the four-unit Barakah plant in the UAE. Currently home to 25 reactors and over 24 GWe of capacity, a further three reactors are under construction – Shin Hanul 2 and Shin-Kori 5 and 6. However, it too has faced political headwinds. The former president had announced a nuclear phaseout policy, although this policy was rejected by the incoming president Yoon Suk-yeol, who was elected earlier in 2022.",
            "Despite some regional reticence, India has big plans to expand its current installed nuclear capacity, which includes 23 reactors and nearly 7 GWe. A further eight reactors are under construction and 12 more are in the planning phase for a combined 15 GWe. National nuclear capacity is expected to reach about 22.5 GWe by 2031. The bulk of India’s nuclear power programme is based on domestic technology and the country has also sought independence of its nuclear fuel cycle by developing its thorium resources. In the longer term, India is expected to reach 63 GWe of nuclear capacity within the 2030s.",
            "Neighbouring Pakistan also plans a large increase in its nuclear power capacity, although it is building on a fleet of just six operating reactors with a combined capacity of 3.3 GWe that supply less than 10% of national electricity. The six operating plants were supplied by China and a further reactor is also planned. Nuclear remains an important element of the country’s energy policy with a longer-term goal of nearly 9 GWe at 10 sites by the end of the decade.",
            "India’s eastward neighbour Bangladesh is also building nuclear capacity, with two VVER-1200 reactors under construction by Rosatom at Rooppur. Unit 1 is scheduled to start operating in 2023 and unit 2 in 2024. Rosatom will maintain the plant for the first year and Russia will also supply fuel for the plant.",
            "Nearby Sri Lanka is also expected to take its first steps towards nuclear generation in the coming years. The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) produced its Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan 2015-2034 which includes a 600 MWe plant. A subsequent draft detailed two units, starting in 2035 and 2037, respectively. Sri Lanka is working with Russia on its nuclear programme and has also signed nuclear cooperation agreements with both India and Pakistan.",
            "The Philippines is home to a mothballed nuclear power station that was never completed, although it is now considering a possible revival of the Bataan plant. This 621 MWe Westinghouse design was constructed in 1984 but soaring energy demand is prompting a reappraisal. The Philippine Energy Plan 2018-2040 included a Nuclear Power Programme Roadmap, targeting the first plant commissioning in 2027. The country is also looking at SMR development and has signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Rosatom to pursue this goal.",
            "Thailand has operated a research reactor since 1977 but its more recent 2015 Power Development Plan sets out ambitions to build two 1000 MW units by 2036, a considerable delay on earlier plans for nuclear power development.",
            "Similarly, Indonesia deferred earlier plans for a nuclear power plant but has more recently expressed renewed interest, in particular looking at SMRs and a ThorCon thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR). A timeframe of 2045 is anticipated for any substantial nuclear development but a 10 MWe experimental nuclear power reactor is expected to be built at Serpong.",
            "In central Asia, Uzbekistan is also actively planning to develop nuclear power generation. Uzbekistan’s energy strategy will see nuclear power provide around 15% of national electricity demand by 2030 and the country has inked a deal with Russia for the development of a VVER-1200 reactor by 2028.",
            "Kazakhstan is already one of the world’s biggest producers of uranium but currently has no operating nuclear power plants after a single reactor was decommissioned in 1999. Nonetheless, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev recently advocated a move towards nuclear power generation in Kazakhstan.",
            "While China and India are clearly leading nuclear power development in the region, it is clear that many other Asian nations are looking to increase the nuclear contribution to their energy mix. Drivers for this growth include efforts to address climate change or reduce air pollution from coal-fired power stations in China, for instance, while some nations are looking to build energy independence or rapidly expand capacity as part of large-scale infrastructure development in response to economic growth, like India, for instance. Developments in Ukraine have further emphasised the importance of energy security and with many reactors in the region already more than 30 years old, the need for replacement is on the agenda. Rapid economic growth across the region and on-going environmental concerns are set to underpin renewed engagement with nuclear power. Mainland China and India share many common drivers for nuclear power development and are expected to be the primary promoters of this industry in Asia Pacific. It is perhaps no surprise that IHS Markit estimates the two populous and rapidly growing markets will likely underpin close to a third of the world’s total power demand additions during 2021-2050."

            "After more than three decades, the Philippines is again operating a nuclear facility, the Subcritical Assembly for Training, Education and Research (SATER), according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). In 2014, a proposal was accepted to utilise fuel elements of a shutdown research reactor for training and education, which the IAEA has been supporting through a series of technical cooperation projects. In the first project, launched in 2016, IAEA assisted the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute (PNRI) to build capacity in reactor design, neutron dosimetry and regulatory matters related to research reactors.",
            "A second cooperation project followed in 2020 and is ongoing to further build capacity, particularly in reactor engineering and operation, reactor utilisation and development of a reactor training programme to sustain local capacity-building activities. “With nuclear power in consideration for the country’s future energy mix and a demand for nuclear technology in different sectors, it is essential to build capacity and develop a new generation of scientists and workforce in this field,” said Syahril Syahril, IAEA Programme Management Officer for the Philippines.",
            "A presidential executive order earlier this year outlined the government's position for the inclusion of nuclear energy in the Philippines' energy mix. US Westinghouse built a NPP the Philippines in the late 1970s, but the project was stopped in 1986 following environmental protests and financial irregularities.",
            "In June, PNRI loaded 44 nuclear fuel rods into the core of the newly constructed tank of SATER. The fuel rods had been previously stored unused for more than 30 years. The new SATER facility is housed at the Philippine Research Reactor 1 (PRR-1) building and will remain in a subcritical state, which means the nuclear fission chain reaction is dependent on neutrons from an external source.",
            "The 1MWt PRR-1 research reactor had reached criticality in 1963, but has been in extended shut down since 1988. “The activation of PRR-1 SATER is a milestone for the Philippines, as the facility will provide significant support in re-establishing nuclear capabilities in the country,” said Alvie Asuncion-Astronomo, Associate Scientist and former Head of PNRI’s Nuclear Reactor Operations Section. In the past two years, IAEA assisted the local regulatory and operating staff by providing recommendations on licensing and commissioning PRR-1 SATER. IAEA and international experts participated in various on-site missions.",
            "PRR-1 SATER will support recently launched nuclear education programmes at the University of the Philippines Diliman and Mapua University. In the field of research, it will be used for reactor physics experiments, as well as a demonstration facility for neutron irradiation and neutron activation analysis.",
            "“PRR-1 SATER is expected to be a training reactor for research reactor operators, regulators and users. It also aims to increase the research reactor stakeholder base in the country,” Asuncion-Astronomo said. “The facility is projected to open the whole scientific field of reactor physics and engineering for Filipinos and to pave the way for the Philippines to strengthen its niche in the nuclear field.”",
            "The facility is expected to conclude commissioning tests and become fully operational by 2023.",

            "An International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Support and Assistance Mission to Zaporizhzhia (ISAMZ) set out for Ukraine on the evening of 29 August to ensure nuclear safety and security at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP). Earlier that day IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi wrote on his Twitter page: \"The IAEA support and assistance mission is already on its way to the Zaporizhzhia NPP. I am proud to be leading this mission, which will arrive at the ZNPP later this week.” He added that \"it is necessary to protect the security of Ukraine and Europe's largest nuclear facility”.",
            "ZNPP has been controlled by Russian forces since March but is operated by its Ukrainian staff. The site has come under repeated and increasingly intense shelling, and on 25 August temporarily lost connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line. Russia has repeatedly accused Ukrainian forces of attacking the plant, while Ukraine insists Russian forces are responsible and are stationing military hardware there.",
            "The ISAMZ will bring clarity to the situation and help address any contradictory information about the status of the facility, its operation and the damage it has sustained. Addressing United Nations Security Council earlier in August about the deteriorating situation at ZNPP Grossi said: “It is those facts, gathered during a site visit, that are needed for the IAEA to be able to develop and provide an independent risk assessment of the nuclear safety and security risks.”",
            "IAEA said that, after reaching ZNPP later this week, ISAMZ will assess the physical damage to the facilities, determine the functionality of the main and backup safety and security systems, and evaluate the working conditions of the control room staff. At the same time, the mission will undertake urgent safeguards activities to verify that nuclear material is used only for peaceful purposes.",
            "The 14-member team includes high-level IAEA official as well as experts from different countries. As well as Grossi, the IAEA staff include: Jacek Bylica, IAEA Chief of Cabinet; Lydie Evrard, IAEA Deputy Director-General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security; Massimo Aparo, IAEA Deputy Director-General and Head of the Department of Safeguards; Diego Candano Laris, Senior Advisor to the Director-General; Florin Abazi, IAEA Senior Inspector; and Fredrik Dahl, IAEA Spokesperson, Office of Public Information and Communication.",

            "The IAEA did not name the other experts but a New York Times report on 27 August said they would be from “mostly neutral countries” such as Poland, Lithuania, China, Serbia, Albania, France, Italy, Jordan, Mexico and North Macedonia. Neither the US nor the UK will be involved as Russia had dismissed those countries as “unfairly biased” over their support for the government in Kyiv, the paper said. France24 said on 29 August that the team would include “experts who are considered pro-Ukrainian – such as Polish and Latvian experts – but also experts from countries considered pro-Russian, from Serbia or other countries considered close to Moscow.”",
            "The Wall Street Journal said on 29 August that team would be in Ukraine from 31 August until 3 September and would take spare parts, radiation monitoring equipment and other equipment to ZNPP.",
            "IAEA has been unable to visit ZNPP since before the conflict began in February. Moscow, which took control of the plant in early March, has repeatedly called for an IAEA inspection, but Petro Kotin, head of the Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom, refused to contemplate this as long as Russia was in control. However, after weeks of international diplomacy, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky agreed to IAEA mission provided that it travelled there through Ukrainian territory. Russia initially argued that the team should reach the plant through Russian territory, noting that travelling from Kyiv would entail passing through the frontline putting IAEA personnel at risk. However, following further international mediation, Russia agreed that the team could travel via Kyiv.",
            "France has played a key role in bringing about the visit. Grossi met with President Emmanuel Macron on 25 August. The previous week Macron had a telephone conversation with Russian President Vladimir, while Ukrainian President Zelensky had talks in Lviv with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Turkey also subsequently hosted a meeting in Istanbul between Gross and the Director General of Russia’s Rosatom State Corporation Alexey Likhachev who was accompanied by Alexander Trembitsky, Head of Russian nuclear regulator Rostechnadzor, and Mikhail Ulyanov, Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to International Organisations in Vienna.",

            "Meanwhile attacks on ZNPP continue. Grossi said on 28 August that Ukraine had informed IAEA of further shelling but it said all safety systems remained operational and there had been no increase in radiation levels. IAEA said ZNPP had access to off-site electricity after the plant temporarily lost connection to its last remaining operational 750 kilovolt (kV) external power line on 25 August which caused the two operating units at the plant to be disconnected from the electricity grid. The other four units at ZNPP had been earlier and remained in shutdown.",
            "However two units were reconnected the following day. Ukraine told the IAEA that the ZNPP was now connected both to a 750 kV power line forming part of the national electricity grid and to a 330 kV line linked to a nearby thermal power facility that can also provide off-site power if required, which had remained operational throughout. ZNPP normally has four external 750 kV power lines, but three of them were lost earlier during the conflict.",
            "Grossi said shelling had hit the area of the plant’s two special buildings, both located about 100 metres from the reactor buildings, as well as one overpass area. Those buildings house facilities including water treatment plants, equipment repair shops and waste management facilities. Damage on some water pipelines at the site had been repaired. All measurements of radioactivity at the ZNPP site were within normal range, and there was no indication of any hydrogen leakage, Grossi said, citing information from Ukraine.",
            "According to an “urgent briefing” on 27 August from Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov ZNPP had been shelled by heavy artillery three times the previous day. \"A total of 17 shells were fired, four of which hit the roof of Special Building 1, where 168 assemblies with American nuclear fuel from Westinghouse are stored. Another 10 shells exploded 30 metres from the dry storage facility for used nuclear fuel and three other shells exploded in the area of Special Building 2, which houses the TVEL fresh nuclear fuel storage facility and the solid radioactive waste storage facility.\"",
            "The same day, the Russian Permanent Mission to the UN Security Council submitted evidence of shelling of ZNPP by the Ukrainian military. “We have distributed a letter to the members of the UN Security Council about the presentation of the Russian Defence Ministry on the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia NPP by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on 25 August, \" the permanent mission said on Twitter.",
            "Shelling intensified over the following days and on 29 August Zaporozhye Region’s administration said on Telegram that shells had damaged roof of the fresh fuel storage and posted a photo of a hole in the roof allegedly caused by the strike. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of doing everything possible to prevent the IAEA mission from visiting.",

            "According to the adopted schedule, the construction of the first NPP in Poland will start in 2026, and in 2033 the first unit with a capacity of approximately 1-1.6GWe will be launched. Subsequent units will be implemented every 2-3 years, and the entire nuclear programme provides for the construction of six nuclear units with a total installed capacity of approximately 6-9GWe, based on large, proven generation III (+) pressurised water reactors.",
            "The main goal of the changes introduced by the government is to shorten the time of investment implementation. The estimated investment required for this is PLN150 billion ($32bn).According to the amendments, public administration bodies, upon a justified investor's request, will provide information and data free of charge for use in connection with the performance of tasks related to nuclear power facilities and associated investments. The catalogue of accompanying investments will in future include any investments required to conduct environmental and site investigations for NPP construction and supporting infrastructure.",
            "The amendments also allow for the temporary operation of a nuclear facility during the period between issuance of a commissioning licence and issuance of an operating licence. The new rules are expected to enter into force by the end of this year.",
            "In March, Polskie Elektrownie Jadrowe (PEJ – Polish Nuclear Power Plants) submitted a report on the environmental impact of the first NPP, which is to be built in Pomeraniach to the General Director for Environmental Protection. The environmental impact assessment (EIA) report covers the construction and operation of the plant with an electric capacity of up to 3750MWe, in the area of the municipalities: Choczewo or Gniewino and Krokowa.",
            "US, French and South Korean companies have all expressed interest in supplying nuclear plants and are busy developing local supply chains to support their positions. In 2021, the government ratified an intergovernmental nuclear cooperation agreement giving the USA 18 months to prepare a technology and financing offer. The US Trade & Development Agency then provided a grant to PEJ to support engineering and design studies by Westinghouse and Bechtel for an AP1000 reactor. Also in 2021 EDF offered to build up to six 1650 MWe EPR units. In April 2022 Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power (KHNP) offered to build six 1345 MWe APR1400 units, with the first to begin operation by 2033 and also offered to finance 20-30% of the project."

The CA-20 is the largest and heaviest structural module on the nuclear island. Sanmen 3 is a CAP1000 reactor design – China’s adaptation of the Westinghouse AP1000 – which uses modular construction techniques, enabling large structural modules to be built at factories and then installed at the site.",
            "The CA20 is cuboid in shape, with a length of 20.5 metres, a width of 14.1 metres, and a height of 20.9 metres. To install it in the 5th and 6th areas of the nuclear island auxiliary powerhouse it was lifted into place by a 2,600-ton crawler crane. The entire hoisting process was safe and quality controllable, and the installation accuracy was controlled within 3 mm tolerance, CNNC noted.",
            "Because of its heavy weight, large size, and internal complexity, the CA20 module requires a large amount of welding. As the on-site assembly site is close to the sea, where the wind is strong and the air is humid, automatic welding is used. This includes full penetration butt welding, some plug welding and fillet welding. This minimises labour, ensures stable welding quality and reduced construction time.",
            "More than 1376 cubic metres of concrete will now be poured to fill the walls of the CA20 module.",

            "“The Corps of Engineers has worked diligently to award the contract for this very complex and challenging project,” said Baltimore District Commander Col. Estee Pinchasin. “Our radiological experts have safely executed projects like this in the past, and our team of trained professionals will use proven techniques, precautions and engineering controls to prioritise and ensure the continued safety of our workers, installation community and public.\" Crews are expected to begin mobilising in 2023, and the work is anticipated to take approximately six years to complete.",
            "USACE Baltimore District has released the Final Notice of Availability (NOA), Final Environmental Assessment (EA) and Finding of No Significant Impact (FNSI), and National Historic Preservation Act Section 106 Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) for the proposed action to decommission and dismantle the SM-1A and to release the property for unrestricted use.",
            "The construction of SM-1A began in 1958 and first criticality was achieved in March 1962. The design was based on the concept of the SM-1 reactor at Fort Belvoir, in Virginia, a prototype for stationary medium-power plants (SM). The “1A” notation designates it as the first field plant of its type.",
            "A 20.2-MWt pressurised water reactor, SM-1A was designed to be used as an “in-service” test facility for nuclear power in an Arctic environment, with its primary mission being to supply electrical power and heating steam to Fort Greely. The secondary mission was to study the economics of operating a nuclear power plant in a remote area where conventional fuel costs are high and supply lines unusually long.",
            "By 1968, however, the decision was made to close the plant because of the high operating costs and the projected cost of replacing SM-1A’s reactor pressure vessel. The final shutdown was performed on the SM-1A Reactor in March 1972, in accordance with theSM-1A Decommissioning Plan as approved by the Army Reactor Systems Health and Safety Review Committee (ARCHS). This consisted of removal of the nuclear fuel, minor decontamination, shipment of pre-packaged radioactive waste, encasing certain reactor components (vapor container, waste tanks, and demineraliser room), sealing the pressure vessel, and installing appropriate warning signs and monitoring devices.",
            "Certain areas were maintained as restricted areas for radiation safety considerations. This method of decommissioning was selected due to the low initial cost and low personnel radiation exposure. Future remediation was to take place at a time when radiation levels and quantities of radioactive waste were significantly reduced due to radioactive decay. The plant put in safe storage (SAFSTOR) condition.",
            "Because of SM-1A’s historical significance (the plant was found eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places), and because decommissioning will adversely affect the property, USACE signed a memorandum of agreement with the Alaska State Historic Preservation Office and the City of Delta Junction outlining how the history of SM-1A and its unique artic mission will be preserved.",
            "USACE said that “when safe and feasible,” it will salvage historical items from the reactor facility. This includes informational safety plaques and an unopened time capsule. Also, within two years of awarding the decommissioning contract, USACE will develop a detailed plan for the identification, curation, storage, and transportation of SM-1A’s historical items.",
            "USACE is responsible for two other military reactors. The MH-1A was installed on the former World War II Liberty ship Sturgis, which became the world’s first floating NPP.

SNC recently informed the agency that the company had completed the inspections, tests, analyses, and acceptance criteria needed to show Vogtle 3 can begin safe operations.",
            "“This is the first time we’ve authorised a reactor’s initial start-up through our Part 52 licensing process,” said Andrea Veil, Director of the NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation. “Before authorisation, we independently verified that Vogtle unit 3 has been properly built and will protect public health and safety when it transitions to operation. Our resident inspectors at Vogtle will keep a close eye on unit 3 as the fuel load and start-up testing move forward. We’re focused on safety so the country can use Vogtle’s additional carbon-free electricity. We will maintain this focus as we license the next generation of new reactors.”",
            "The NRC’s decision moves Vogtle unit 3, adjacent to the operating units 1 and 2, near Waynesboro, Georgia, out of the construction reactor oversight programme and into the operating reactor oversight process. Vogtle 4 remains under construction. The Vogtle 3&4 1117MWe Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, the only new nuclear power units under construction in the USA, are already billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.",

However, for newcomer countries, and others in Central Asia, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America, this is unlikely to be a key factor in their technology choices. No other nuclear supplier offers such all-round support, including soft financing and BOO options. Russia takes a long view, committing to support that may last a century, sometimes begining with assistance in establishing nuclear research centres and research reactors. Extensive training is also provided as well as fuel supply, used fuel management services and decommissioning. So, while other suppliers, in particular the USA, are making rapid inroads in Europe, the rest of the world may still prefer to look to Moscow."

        "text": [
            "THE PILE FUEL STORAGE PONDS (PFSP) at Sellafield are among the most challenging nuclear decommissioning projects in Europe. Following the completion of a key stage in the removal of larger solid wastes from the ponds, a new dewatering and descaling project can now begin.",
            "The project requires two handling systems to reach hard-to-access parts of the PFSP’s structure, and to avoid potential collisions with existing lifting equipment.",
            "Procured for Sellafield via Cumbria Nuclear Solutions (CNSL), SCX Special Projects engineered two single girder cranes, each tailored to the ponds’ existing infrastructure and the task of enabling the next phase of decommissioning at the PFSP facility. A 2t MOTS (Modified Off The Shelf) crane with a bespoke extending, cantilevered bridge reaches into the numerous recesses along the pond’s wall. And a 4t COTS+ (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) crane equipped with collision avoidance technology shares the same rails as the existing 12t pond crane.",
            "Speaking about the background to the project Stuart Robson, technical sales engineer, SCX, says Sellafield established the Decommissioning Delivery Partnership (DDP) in 2016 as a framework to deliver its substantial decommissioning and land remediation challenge. Originally planned to run for five years, in 2021 the DDP was extended by a further five years to 2026.",
            "“The DDP is split into three Lots – Lots 2 and 3 focus on Magnox waste and swarf storage, while Lot 1 brings together two Pile Fuel facilities along with general site remediation and associated decommissioning work,” he adds.",
            "“Lot 1 contains three consortia — one of which is Cumbria Nuclear Solutions Limited (CNSL), a collaboration of six specialist nuclear businesses. One of the primary facilities in Lot 1 is called the Pile Fuel Storage Pond (PFSP) — this is among the most challenging nuclear decommissioning projects in Europe. PFSP had recently been emptied of larger solid wastes, completing an important phase in its decommissioning journey. Now the challenge is to descale and dewater the ponds. Led",
            "by consortium member Westinghouse, CNSL went to market in late 2018 with a requirement for ‘PFSP Enhanced Mechanical Handling’ — in essence, two enhanced and modified cranes to help carry out the required lifting and handling associated with the next phase in the project. SCX was awarded the contract to design and supply the cranes in May 2019.”",
            "Robson says the project progressed smoothly, and the modified cranes were designed, engineered, and assembled at SCX’s facilities in Sheffield during 2020. They passed Factory Acceptance Tests in late 2020 and were delivered to site and commissioned in summer 2021.",
            "The requirements for the two cranes differed in complexity: the smaller 2t crane needed an extending, cantilevered bridge to reach into the various recesses of the PFSP, which meant significant mechanical and electrical upgrades to a standard COTS crane.",
            "The second 4t crane needed an anti-collision system, given that it shares rails with an existing crane. However, mechanically it remains a relatively standard overhead travelling crane.",
            "“Sellafield has its own exacting standards for electrical wiring and labelling, so all electrical upgrades were engineered and commissioned to meet those,” adds Robson. He continues: “SCX has teams of mechanical, electrical and TÜV-certified safety design engineers that work together to create a solution that: satisfies the client’s functionality and budget, ensures the safety of the people working with the system, and is practical to build and install.",
            "“SCX’s experience in modifying commercial-off-the-shelf cranes goes back decades, and many of our solutions for the demanding nuclear sector have been designed and built this way. Using COTS equipment as the basis of a nuclear handling solution makes sense, because that equipment is already proven in industry. There’s no sense in reinventing the wheel and going bespoke — we always consider what we can do with existing, readily available and proven equipment first. If it’s not possible to deliver a fit-for-purpose system using the COTS/MOTS route, that’s when we explore the bespoke route.",
            "A spokesman for CNSL says: “The project ran smoothly thanks to the good working relationships between all parties. The design and manufacture was undertaken professionally by SCX, and when minor issues arose — to be expected in the development of bespoke handling solutions — they were resolved quickly and to our satisfaction. The challenge of Covid was unavoidable, however it was accommodated well, and solutions to any problems were found in a timely manner.”",
