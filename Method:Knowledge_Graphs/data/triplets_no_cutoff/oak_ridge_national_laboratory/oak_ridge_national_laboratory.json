            "US-based advanced reactor developer X-energy has been awarded a $148.5m (€138.8m) tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Triso-X, of a first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ",
            "Funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the award is part of a programme jointly administered by the US Department of Energy, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.",
            "X-energy chief executive officer J. Clay Sell said the award is a massive step forward for building the supply chain to advance the next generation of nuclear energy. ",
            "“Strengthening energy security here and around the world requires expanding secure, domestic manufacturing capabilities across the energy sector,” he said, adding that the tax credit would create opportunities to enable the delivery of Triso-X fuel on a commercial scale.",
            "The fuel fabrication facility, known as TX-1, is designed to produce up to 714,000 “pebbles” of Triso-X (tri-structural isotropic) particle fuel a year along with other nuclear fuel products. ",
            "At the heart of each Triso-X fuel particle is a kernel of uranium oxide and carbide. The kernel is surrounded by four barrier layers that act in concert to stabilise and contain the uranium kernel.  Each pebble houses tens of thousands of Triso-X particles.",
            "Triso-X particle fuel is considered “the most robust nuclear fuel on the planet,” according to the DOE, because it can withstand very high temperatures without melting, which is key to its safety. Triso-X manufactures its own proprietary version of Triso fuel to ensure supply, improve quality and reduce costs. ",
            "Triso-X has operated a pilot nuclear fuel fabrication facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory since 2016, serving as a demonstration facility of the company’s patented Triso fabrication processes.",

            "The Xe-100 is a Generation IV high-temperature gas-cooled reactor unit. Each reactor is engineered to operate as a single 80 MW unit and can be optimised as a four-unit plant delivering 320 MW. It can provide baseload power to an electricity system or support industrial applications with 200 MW thermal output per unit of high pressure, high temperature steam.",

            "Ultra Safe Nuclear said earlier this year it would invest $13m (€13.1m) over five years to open the pilot fuel manufacturing operation to meet demand for fuelling its own micro modular reactor and other advanced terrestrial and space energy systems.",
            "Triso is “tri-structural isotropic particle fuel”. Each Triso particle is made up of a uranium, carbon and oxygen fuel kernel. The kernel is encapsulated by three layers of carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products.",
            "The particles are incredibly small (about the size of a poppy seed) and very robust. They can be fabricated into cylindrical pellets or billiard ball-sized spheres called “pebbles” for use in either high temperature gas or molten salt-cooled reactors.",
            "Triso fuels are structurally more resistant to neutron irradiation, corrosion, oxidation and high temperatures – the factors that most impact fuel performance – than traditional reactor fuels.",
            "Each particle acts as its own containment system thanks to its triple-coated layers. This allows them to retain fission products under all reactor conditions.",

            "personal blog, claims: “Kemmerer, Wyoming will soon be home to the most advanced nuclear facility in the world.”",
            "He says: “The plant was designed by TerraPower, a company I started in 2008. But my nuclear journey started several years earlier, when I first read a scientific paper for a new type of nuclear power plant. The design was far safer than any existing plant, with the temperatures held under control by with the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes. It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night. As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it— and revolutionize how we generate power in the US and around the world…. But that technology was just an idea in a lab and on a computer screen until today.”",
            "Gates expects the NRC review process to take a couple of years. “So in the meantime, TerraPower will continue to build the non-nuclear parts of the facility”. Construction will begin next year on the so-called “energy island,” which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit. (The reactor will eventually be part of a “nuclear island,” and the team hopes to start building that in 2026.)” He adds: “While these first-of-a-kind projects can be big and risky, they are too important for our future to fail to act.”",
            "In an earlier blog in May 2023, Gates provides some more comments on the reactor technology. “Like other power plant designs, it uses heat to turn water into steam, which moves a turbine, which generates electricity. And like other nuclear facilities, it generates the heat by splitting uranium atoms in a chain reaction. But that’s pretty much where the similarities stop.”",
            "He continues: “A typical reactor keeps the atom-splitting nuclear reaction under control by circulating water around a uranium core. But using water as a coolant presents two challenges. First, water isn’t very good at absorbing heat — it turns to steam and stops absorbing heat at just 100 degrees C. Second, as water gets hot, its pressure goes up, which puts strain on your pipes and other equipment. If there’s an emergency — say, an earthquake cuts off all the electricity to the plant and you can’t keep pumping water — the core continues to make heat, raising the pressure and potentially causing an explosion.”",
            "He therefore believes liquid metal is a better coolant than water. “The Natrium plant uses liquid sodium, whose boiling point is more than eight times higher than water’s, so it can absorb all the extra heat generated in the nuclear core. Unlike water, the sodium doesn’t need to be pumped, because as it gets hot, it rises, and as it rises, it cools off. Even if the plant loses power, the sodium just keeps absorbing heat without getting to a dangerous temperature that would cause a meltdown.”",
            "On the plant’s molten salt energy storage system, he says this will allow the Natrium facility to control how much electricity it produces at any given time. “That’s unique among nuclear reactors, and it’s essential for integrating with power grids that use variable sources like solar and wind.”",
            "He also extols TerraPower’s digital design process. “Using supercomputers, they’ve digitally tested the Natrium design countless times, simulating every imaginable disaster, and it keeps holding up. TerraPower’s sophisticated work has drawn interest from around the globe, including an agreement to collaborate on nuclear power technology in Japan and investments from the South Korean conglomerate SK and the multinational steel company ArcelorMittal.”",
            "While the TerraPower website provides some details of work done with molten salt, it contains very little information about the reactor technology. According to a video: “In the reactor building, advanced uranium fuel is inserted into an enclosed container and covered with liquid sodium. A chain reaction starts when uranium atoms slit and release neutrons and heat the metal coolant inside the reactor system…. The liquid sodium is heated and then transfers thermal energy to pipes filled with molten salt. This… then travels to a very large storage tank that serves as a thermal battery for the plant…. The molten salt passes near water-filled tubes and boils the water to make super heated steam. This… then helps to turn a turbine, creating electricity…. The molten salt is transferred to a cold tank and eventually back to the nuclear island.”",
            "Basically the Natrium reactor is a sodium-cooled fast reactora. Currently, the only commercially operating liquid metal-cooled fast reactors are in Russia, using sodium as the coolant. Russia is also constructing the world’s first lead-cooled small modular reactor (Brest-OD-300) in Seversk as part of a facility to demonstrate an on-site closed fuel cycle, including novel fuel fabrication. This reactor, based on decades of complex research and development, and supported by the entire Russian nuclear industry, is due to begin operation in 2029 and probably qualifies as the most advanced reactor facility in the world.",
            "While research on fast reactors took place in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, things began to change in the late 1970s as concerns about scarce uranium resources waned and public opinion became increasingly hostile in the wake of the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the USA and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. By the early 1990s the US, the UK and Germany had closed down their programmes. France continued with its Phenix and SuperPhenix projects for a few more years, finally closing SuperPhenix in 1998 and Phenix in 2009, Subsequently, in 2019, France also cancelled the Generation IV ASTRID sodium-cooled fast reactor demonstrator design project. Although interest is now reviving in Europe and the USA both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the early design phase and is probably decades away from implementation.",
            "As an example, India’s prototype sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor began fuel loading in March. The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR) began to design the reactor in 1980 and construction began in 2004, 24 years later. It was originally expected to be commissioned in 2010 but suffered a series of delays over the next 14 years."

            "Image: Mikal Boe, Chairman and CEO of Core Power (courtesy of Seatrade)",
            "UK-based start-up Core Power CEO Mikal Bøe told a press conference that the company is expecting to see its first orders for vessels equipped with nuclear reactors before 2030. This includes both floating NPPs (FNPPs) and nuclear-powered ships.",
            "“The formation of the first order book starts in 2028-29,” Bøe told Ship & Bunker at the event. “Our aim is to build a $10bn order book by 2030, and the first deliveries would then be in 2030-35 — we’re not quite sure, but I’d say probably in the latter end of that bucket.”",
            "He added that the initial orderbook would probably be for FNPPs. “It’s kind of a low-hanging fruit, a very big market, and it’s easier to deliver from a regulatory point of view. “But I would expect to see the first ship orders coming through not too late after that.”",
            "A nuclear-powered ship would have a number of advantages including zero carbon emissions, while the excess energy produced by the reactor would enable ship to travel faster with the possibility of sending power back to the land-based grid while at berth. However, the high up-front capital costs for a ship of this type, would be around $700m.",
            "Core Power plans to lobby for updates to standards from the the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and the Inernational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to provide a regulatory framework for nuclear-powered shipping. Bøe expects the IMO to modernise and revise its current code for nuclear merchant ships by 2028. “We think the IAEA is pretty much ready to do this. “They’re doing it now, and I think that they’ll be ready before the IMO,” he noted. “And then, of course, you really need to work separately with the insurance industry to make sure that they have the right liability regime in place.”",
            "Bøe told the meeting that the molten salt reactor (MSR) design that Core Power is working on, using heated and liquefied chloride salts, can solve a number of issues for the maritime sector.",
            "MSR technologies were first tested in the US as a nuclear option for aircraft in the 1950s. A six-year experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory then tested the technology before being cancelled. Bøe stressed that this was using old technology and designs and the new designs would not face a similar fate.",
            "Bøe said the first vessel using MSR technology could be launched as early as the mid-2030s, with the company about to build a micro-reactor to test the design, at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in the US, before then producing a commercial prototype. In August 2022, Core Power, MIT Energy Initiative and INL were awarded research funding by DOE’s Nuclear Energy University Program, a three-year study into the development of offshore floating nuclear power generation in the USA.",
            "Core Power is also a participant with US-based TerraPower and power utility Southern Co, in the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE). In 2021, Southern Company DOE signed an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE as a proof-of-concept critical fast-spectrum salt reactor. MCRE aims to be which the world’s first fast-spectrum salt reactor to achieve criticality at INL, Collaborators in the MCRE project are Terrapower, INL, Orano (USA) Federal Services, Electric Power Research Institute, and 3M Company.",
            "The project is supported through the DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) under a five-year, $170m cost-shared funding agreement. It will provide crucial operational data to support the future development of TerraPower’s Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR), informing the design, licensing and operation of a demonstration reactor.",
            "Bøe said $2.5bn would be spent on development before a commercial ship is even ordered, much of the financing coming from the US government funds. That is in addition to $150m Washington has already invested, while Core Power shareholders, Wan Hai, Express Container Lines, Terrapower and Hyundai Heavy Industries have all invested in the MSR development. And a new funding round is expected in 2025-26.",
            "Core Power was formed in 2018 “to bridge that gap and create an organisation that would pave the way for development and successful deployment of advanced reactor technologies for the maritime industries”. In 2023, the company attracted Japanese investment for its FNPP project. Some 13 companies, including Onomichi Dockyard and Imabari Shipbuilding, had invested about $80m in project, according to Nikkei Asia. Although Core released no statement on the development, it reproduced the Nikkei article on its website.",
            "According to Nikkei, Core Power said at that time that it planned launch a demonstration vessel in 2026 and commercialise it between 2030 and 2032. The company aimed to build a track record overseas, then expand in Japan. It estimated that the demonstration vessel would require approximately JPY50bn ($361m), and Core Power and its partner companies would share the cost. The investment by Japanese companies would also be used to fund development, Nikkei said.",
            "In May, in his capacity as Vice Chair of the recently established Nuclear Energy Maritime Organisation (NEMO), Bøe addressed the IMO on behalf of the World Nuclear Transport Institute (WNTI) at the 108th session of the Maritime Safety Committee. He said NEMO will help WNTI spearhead the essential work to assist the IMO and the IAEA with the modernisation of the entire regulatory ecosystem for nuclear-powered ships and floating nuclear powerplants. “Our common aim is to have a fit-for-purpose ecosystem of rules and regulations established by 2030.” He added that NEMO will apply for consultative NGO status at the IMO in due course."

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for review, marking the first time in more than 40 years that the NRC has docketed this type of application for a commercial non-light water reactor. Terrapower submitted its application in March. The application applied new technology-inclusive guidance that was recently issued by NRC to ensure consistency, quality, and uniformity of reviews for non-light water reactor applicants.",
            "“We’re excited to have our construction permit application docketed for review by the NRC,” said Jeff Navin, the director of external affairs for TerraPower. “By implementing the licensing modernization project framework, TerraPower is helping to demonstrate a more streamlined approach to licensing non-light water advanced reactors.”",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE). The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources.",
            "Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",
            "TerraPower has received significant and constant DOE support for its Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D that resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years. The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030."

            "Some 430 women, current and future nuclear professionals, gathered at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) headquarters in Vienna for talks and interactions with senior nuclear experts, industry and recruitment agencies. The event, entitled “For More Women in Nuclear”, took place from 7 to 8 March in commemoration of International Women’s Day. It was opened by IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi who urged other organisations and members of the nuclear industry to address the gender disparity of women in the nuclear sector.",
            "The two days were filled with panel discussions, presentations and career talks. IAEA Marie Skłodowska-Curie Fellowship Programme (MSCFP) students and alumnae, and Lise Meitner Programme (LMP) participants from more than 100 countries exchanged their experiences and aspirations with opportunities for networking and making contacts.",
            "IAEA says women are far from being adequately represented in the nuclear field. They often face barriers to enter and progress in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), right from their school years. According to Women in Nuclear Global, women comprise less than a quarter of professionals working in the nuclear sector globally, particularly in senior roles. With Grossi’s strong support, the number of women in professional and higher categories at the IAEA secretariat has increased from 30% to almost 46% since December 2019 when he joined the Agency. Grossi’s target is for 50% by 2025. However, the real problem is not in the IAEA but “outside”, he said in his opening address to the conference. “The real problem is the imbalance of the presence of women in the professional world, and of course more imbalance when it comes to nuclear and STEM-related professions.”.",
            "He described why and how he had started the MSCFP and LMP programmes, which now had some 600 members. He stressed that this was just a start and that the hundreds of participants in these programmes needed to grow to “thousands and tens of thousands”. He said: “It’s always about the next step and we are not going to stop here.” He told the conference that the nuclear industry was growing and it was the right time become involved. The industry, which currently employed some 2.3m people worldwide would need twice that number. “We need you. The world needs nuclear, and nuclear needs women,” he said.",
            "High-level panel discussion",
            "During the opening meeting, a high-level panel discussed how the international community can work toward breaking down barriers to better support the current and next women leaders in the nuclear sector. “Women need to be given the opportunity to actually see what is there for them in nuclear,” said Sama Bilbao Y Leon, one of the panellists and Director General of the World Nuclear Association (WNA).",
            "“Be bold,” said Aleshia Duncan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Department of Energy in the USA, another panellist. “Make an impression. Make a connection. Make a network and a tribe of people that will support you throughout your career. We’re telling the truth when we say we need you, but we need you to show up as your best self, knowing that you can do the job, knowing that you can bring your whole self, knowing that you can be who you are, and do the job.”",
            "As well as Director General Grossi, the other panellists included Francisco Rondinelli, President, Nuclear Energy Commission of Brazil (CNEN); Mitsuru Uesaka,Chairperson, Japan Atomic Energy Agency; Byungjoo Min, President, Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology; Soheir Saad Korraa, President of WiN Africa and Professor of Radiation Molecular Biology at the National Centre for Radiation Research & Technology.",
            "Career talks in breakout sessions focused on strengthening participants’ networks and leadership skills, as well as how the nuclear community can support women throughout their careers in the field. Senior nuclear experts and leaders shared their experiences and answered questions. Industry professionals had the opportunity to become acquainted with a growing community of women nuclear experts and explore possibilities to advance their careers.",
            "During the event’s closing session, the IAEA and WNA signed an agreement pledging to work together to help place women in more professional positions in the nuclear sector. Participants of both programmes also presented their joint statement acknowledging how crucial it is to champion and empower women in nuclear science and technology, and that the field must become more accessible to women. The joint statement was the result of an innovative synchronous collaborative online methodology allowing them to democratically write and edit together their vision of how to attract and retain more women in the nuclear field before the event. Their joint statement pledged to support, advocate, promote and practice policies that empower women, ensure gender equality, and enable women to reach their full potential in the nuclear field.",
            "The event also showcased the achievements of the MSCFP and LMP programmes and provided a platform to not only strengthen existing partnerships with donors, but also to establish new ones, ensuring the continued sustainability and success of both programmes for years to come.",
            "The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Programme",
            "The MSCFP programme was launched in 2020 named after physicist Marie Skłodowska-Curie, the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and still the only person to win two Nobels in two different scientific fields. The Programme aims to inspire and encourage young women to pursue a career in the nuclear field, by providing highly motivated female students with scholarships for Master’s programmes and an opportunity to pursue an internship facilitated by the IAEA.",
            "Selected students receive a scholarship for Master’s programmes in nuclear related studies at accredited universities. They are also provided with an opportunity to pursue an internship facilitated by the IAEA for up to 12 months. Scholarships are awarded annually to 100 plus students depending on the availability of funds. Consideration is given to field of study, and geographic and linguistic diversity.",

Over 180 have already completed their master’s programme with the support of the MSCFP, and over 100 of the selected students have been confirmed for an internship facilitated by IAEA. The MSCFP welcomed its fourth and largest cohort to date at the end of 2023, This included 200 scholarship recipients from 97 member states studying in 54 countries, bringing the total number of recipients so far to 560.",
            "During the conference, Carl Hallergard, European Union Ambassador and Permanent Representative to IAEA, announced the EU’s pledge to contribute a further €2m to the MSCFP for future cohorts. The EU is currently the largest MSCFP donor. “MSCFP made it possible for me to follow my dreams of becoming a radiological environmental scientist. After completion of my studies in the Republic of Korea, my aspiration is to use my skills to contribute towards examining the environmental situation in my home country,” said Zarina Salkenova, a 2022 Marie Curie Skłodowska-Curie Fellow from Kazakhstan.",
            "“On this International Women’s Day, let us reform our support and commit to empowering women in nuclear science and technology,” said Zainab Kamara, a MSCFP recipient from Sierra Leone who studied Nuclear Science and Applications in the UK.",

            "Building on the success of the MSCFP, the IAEA in 2023 announced its second programme to support women in the nuclear sector – the Lise Meitner Programme named after Austrian-Swedish physicist Lise Meitner. The programme includes professional visits to various nuclear facilities, such as but not limited to, nuclear power plants under construction, in operation or in decommissioning, research reactors and centres, scientific institutions, laboratories, industry sector and start-up companies. This is for early- and mid-career women professionals and provides an opportunity to participate in a multi-week visiting professional programme to advance technical and soft skills at host institutions around the world.",

The visiting professionals are not expected to bear any financial cost for participation in the programme. The programme is funded by extra-budgetary and in-kind contributions from IAEA member states and other donors.",
            "“The LMP technical visits have been a transformative experience for the cohorts as well as host organisations, providing invaluable insights and fostering cross-cultural collaboration. It’s not just a programme; it’s a catalyst for professional growth and a bridge connecting diverse perspectives in the global nuclear community,” said Tatjana Jevremovic, an expert in the Nuclear Power Technology Development Section at the IAEA, who led the first two LMP cohorts.",
            "The first visiting professional programme was hosted at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, USA in June 2023. The cohort had the opportunity to visit a nuclear power plant, research reactor, fuel factory, and research labs, among other activities.",
            "“Attending the Lise Meitner Programme was an eye-opening experience,” said Simona Miteva, an LMP Visiting Professional from Bulgaria. “Witnessing the latest advancements in the nuclear field and engaging with industry experts has reinforced my passion for this industry. The programme has not only expanded my knowledge but also ignited a drive to contribute to the future of women in nuclear engineering.”",
            "The second 2023 cohort took place in October 2023, and the visiting professionals shared their time between the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the Idaho National Laboratory in the USA. This focused on strengthening the participants’ individual technical expertise, as well as nuclear reactor modelling, simulations, and virtual environment. Participants also had the chance to visit the nuclear research labs and computational facilities. The third LMP visit is expected to later in 2024 in the Republic of Korea and will focus on nuclear power. During the IAEA Women in Nuclear conference, Minister Nobuharu Imanishi of the Permanent Mission of Japan to the IAEA announced Japan’s agreement to host future LMP cohorts.",
            "“The Lise Meitner Programme was extraordinary. I got familiar with a suite of tools for reactor physics modelling and simulation. These tools are crucial to my organisation, for safety analysis of nuclear reactor structures systems and components during normal and accident conditions,” said Diana Musyoka, a Senior Environmental Scientist from Kenya’s Nuclear Power & Energy Agency. “I also enjoyed the mentorship sessions which opened doors to the careers and lives of women in nuclear. I learnt a lot of best practices that I am currently applying to advance my career in nuclear and to help other young women develop their careers too. The international networks created are proving to be very valuable.”",
            "“Supporting the higher education of young women and their career growth in the nuclear sector is pivotal for the field. With these two programmes, the IAEA supports women at the most crucial stages: their entry to the field and, afterwards, their continued professional development,” said Mikhail Chudakov, Deputy Director General of the IAEA Department of Nuclear Energy. “We will continue to support women from all corners of the globe to fulfil their aspirations and contribute to a better world, through nuclear science and technology.”",

The rods were shipped to the lab from a commercial NPP after completing six years of irradiation. The results from the experiments will be used to support the commercial deployment of high burn-up fuels before the end of the decade.",
            "Higher burn-up fuel is designed to remain in the reactor core for longer periods before being removed for long-term storage. Its use would lead to fewer refuelling outages, increased power output for better economics, and less used fuel generated over the lifetime of the reactor.",
            "The fuel rods were manufactured at GNF’s fabrication facility in Wilmington, North Carolina, with support from the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Accident Tolerant Fuel (ATF) programme. They were later inserted into a commercial reactor for testing, where they completed three full cycles of operation. ORNL will examine the fuel and verify its safety and performance. The post-irradiation experiments will continue for several years. The results will be used to support the development, engineering, and licensing efforts of GNF’s fuel.",
            "“This fuel shipment to Oak Ridge National Laboratory is an important step in GNF’s efforts to commercialise their high burn-up fuel,” said Frank Goldner, a nuclear engineer within DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy. “High burn-up fuels are expected to enhance the performance of today’s reactors and will help us on our path to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.”",

        "title": "X-energy awarded federal tax credit for TRISO fuel facility",
        "text": [
            "US-based X Energy has been awarded $148.5m in tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, TRISO-X, of a first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility (TX-1) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The award is funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and is part of the Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit programme jointly administered by the US Department of Energy (DOE), Department of the Treasury, and Internal Revenue Service.",
            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has described TRISO (TRIstructural-ISOtropic) particle fuel as “the most robust nuclear fuel on the planet”. TRISO fuel particles have a kernel of enriched uranium oxycarbide, encased in carbon and ceramic layers. DOE selected X-energy in 2020 for their Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to receive up to $1.2bn of federal cost-shared funding to develop, license, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors and advanced nuclear fuel fabrication by the end of the decade. TRISO-X has leased research and laboratory space at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) campus in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, since 2016. TRISO-X broke ground in 2022 in Oak Ridge on its commercial-sale Fuel Fabrication Facility, which is expected to be fully operational in 2025.",
            "X-energy’s investment in TX-1 is expected to create approximately 400 permanent jobs and 475 construction jobs. The 215,000-square-foot TX-1 fuel fabrication facility is designed to produce up to 714,000 TRISO fuel pebbles a year along with other nuclear fuel products. The TRISO-X campus is situated on land that was formerly part of ORNL and is located within the Horizon Centre Industrial Park. The 110-acre site was part of a tract released in 1996 for private development to help diversify the region’s economic base. TRISO-X acquired the campus from the Oak Ridge Industrial Development Board in 2022.",
            "“This award is not just an investment in our technology and innovations, it’s a massive step forward for building the supply chain to advance the next generation of nuclear energy,” said X-energy CEO, J Clay Sell. “Strengthening energy security here and around the world requires expanding secure, domestic manufacturing capabilities across the energy sector.”",
            "TRISO-X has already requested a 40-year licence from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to possess and use special nuclear material to manufacture advanced nuclear fuel. Its application was submitted and accepted by NRC in 2022.The Commission says the review is 45% complete.",
            "DOE’s ARDP is providing support for the development of TX-1, and the initial TRISO-X nuclear fuel produced in Oak Ridge will be used for the project. A symbolic ground-breaking ceremony for the TX-1 took place in 2022. ARDP is also supporting the initial deployment of X-energy’s Xe-100 advanced small modular reactor at Dow’s Seadrift, Texas facility. X-energy says it is expected to be the first grid-scale advanced nuclear reactor deployed to serve an industrial site in North America.",
            "TRISO President Dr Pete Pappano said X-energy has 40 employees at five locations, two of which are operating facilities: the TRISO-X Pilot Facility at ORNL and the TRISO-X Research & Development Center located in the Centrus Technology Manufacturing Center. The TRISO-X Pilot Facility operates via a public-private partnership and produces kilogram quantities of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The TRISO-X Research & Development Center operates inside the Centrus Technology Manufacturing Center and will be used to train operators for the commercial fuel facility.",

        "title": "New IAEA publication discusses molten salt reactor technology",
        "text": [
            "A new publication in the IAEA’s Technical Report Series, Status of Molten Salt Reactor Technology, outlines the current status of molten salt reactor (MSR) technology around the world. It reviews the history of MSRs and takes a look at the current research and development activities taking place. The advantages of this technology, including a smaller high level waste footprint and passive safety features, as well as some of the technical challenges, such as developing components capable of operating in very high temperature environments, are detailed.",
            "In the short term, the bulk of nuclear new build projects are expected to be light water reactors but other designs under development, including those that use molten salts as both the fuel and the coolant, may play a role as well, IAEA noted.",
            "Like the pressurised and boiling water reactors, MSRs leverage controlled fission reactions to produce electricity. However, unlike water-cooled reactors, MSR cores are cooled with salts, which may confer numerous advantages in terms of efficiency and make MSRs especially suitable for non-electric applications.",
            "The origins of MSRs can be traced to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the US. Initially developed as part of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in the 1950s, ORNL then ran a trial known as the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) from 1965 to 1969, operating an experimental 7.34 MWt MSR. The project established proof of concept for reactors powered by liquid fuel and cooled by molten salts.",
            "“While MSRs were first conceived of and tested several decades ago, this reactor type has yet to see commercial deployment, though this may change in the near future,” said Tatjana Jevremovic, the Acting Head of the IAEA’s Nuclear Power Technology Development Section. “Molten salt coolants have exceptional capacity for heat absorption, which could allow MSRs to operate at the very high temperatures needed to produce high-grade heat to drive industrial processes including hydrogen production.”",
            "MSRs may use molten salts as a coolant and/or fuel. Most designs are based around liquid fuels dissolved in the molten salt-based coolant. Others are powered by the more traditional solid fuel rods, with the molten salts only serving as the coolant.",
            "“Once sufficient experience will be collected, MSRs have the potential to be the most economical reactor type for closed fuel cycle operation,” said Jiri Krepel, a Senior Scientist in the Advanced Nuclear Systems Group at the Paul Scherrer Institute and Chair of the MSR Working Group in the Generation IV International Forum. “Several designs, utilising thorium-232 and uranium-238, could provide an unprecedented combination of safety and fuel cycle sustainability.”",
            "Several MSR designs are currently under development and approaching deployment readiness, IAEA said. In Canada, a molten salt-based small modular reactor (SMR) concept passed a crucial pre-licensing vendor design review in 2023, the first such review completed for an MSR. And other projects, including in China and the US, continue to make progress, with the hope that MSRs could begin to see deployment as soon as the mid-2030s.",
            "“MSRs can help improve the sustainability of nuclear power, including by contributing to the minimisation of nuclear waste, and enhance proliferation resistance,” said Kailash Agarwal, an IAEA Fuel Cycle Facilities Specialist. “MSRs, particularly those powered by fuel composed of U-233 and thorium salts, can also assist in conserving natural uranium resources.”",
            "IAEA adds a word of caution. “While optimism abounds for deployments in the relatively near future, key challenges remain to be addressed,” it said. “Standards in design safety and fuel salt transportation have yet to be developed, and supply chains for MSR-specific reactor components do not yet exist. Analyses of potential accident scenarios unique to MSRs also remain to be conducted.”",
            "Jevremovic commented: “We know that MSRs are a viable option to support nuclear power expansion plans, but there is still much work to be done before commercial deployment. Licensing new reactor technologies requires a lot of thorough evaluation, particularly with regard to safety analysis. It’s also important for interested countries to consider the specific role they envision MSRs playing in their energy systems.”",
            "In addition to publications, the IAEA supports MSR development and deployment through a range of other initiatives including technical meetings and workshops. In October 2023, the IAEA and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development’s Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD-NEA) jointly organised the International Workshop on the Chemistry of Fuel Cycles for Molten Salt Reactor Technologies in Vienna. The IAEA’s Nuclear Harmonisation and Standardisation Initiative (NHSI), established in 2022, is looking at how to speed up the deployment of advanced reactors, including MSRs, by harmonising regulatory approaches and industrial standardisation. The Agency also maintains the Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), a web platform that collates information, including technical data and other characteristics, on all advanced reactors currently in development.",

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has launched a a regional Clean Energy Training Centre in Warsaw, Poland to serve Poland and the broader Central European region as a training hub for countries considering new or expanded nuclear reactor deployment. It builds on previous international agreements to expand global nuclear energy capacity and combat the climate crisis.",
            "The first training session was launched at Warsaw Technical University in cooperation with Poland’s Ministry of Climate & Environment and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Poland plans to begin building three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors by 2030 to reduce dependence on coal-fired power plants and strengthen energy security.",
            "“This centre symbolises a commitment between the United States and Poland that extends far beyond a commercial relationship,” said Dr Michael Goff, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy. “This catalytic milestone will help ensure Poland has the training and resources it needs to buildout its first nuclear power plant.”",
            "Miłosz Motyka, Poland’s Undersecretary of State and Ministry of Climate & Environment said nuclear energy is an important element of Poland's energy transition. “The implementation of the largest investment in the history of the Polish power system together with our US partners is an expression of the Polish-American strategic alliance. Cooperation with the United States will bring Poland closer to achieving climate neutrality and comprehensive modernisation of the Polish energy sector.\"",
            "DOE also plans to launch regional Clean Energy Training Centres in Ghana and the United Arab Emirates. It is also requesting an additional $8m in the Fiscal Year 2025 budget to establish more training centres over the coming years to support workforce development, training, and knowledge sharing with new and emerging nuclear energy countries in Africa, Asia, and Central Europe.",

            "US-based TerraPower has submitted its construction permit application to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. This is the first application to NRC for construction of a commercial advanced reactor.",
            "TerraPower says it has been working closely with NRC in pre-application meetings and is confident in its application. Non-nuclear construction will begin on the Natrium reactor demonstration project this summer and nuclear construction will begin only after the application is approved by NRC.",
            "“We will continue working closely with local stakeholders, elected officials and regulatory partners as we begin non-nuclear construction this year while working through this application process with the NRC,” said Chris Levesque, President & CEO of TerraPower. “This milestone is one of many that paves the way toward clean, reliable and flexible power for the grid and long-term jobs for the Kemmerer community.”",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",
            "In March, NRC issued new guidance documents to facilitate the licensing of non-light water reactor designs. The guidance is expected to significantly reduce the regulatory uncertainty for new reactor concepts that differ from conventional reactor technologies. DOE said this was good news for advanced reactor vendors, including two DOE demonstration projects with TerraPower and X-energy. Both companies are applying this guidance to their construction permit applications. Both projects are being managed through DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.",
            "TerraPower has received significant and constant DOE support for its Molten Chloride Fast Reactor (MCFR) project. In 2016, DOE awarded a five-year, $40m cost-share award for continued R&D that resulted in a new public-private MCFR project development partnership including TerraPower, Southern Company, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, and Vanderbilt University.",
            "In 2019, the MCFR design team reported a major milestone with 1,000 hours of isothermal loop operations. The MCFR technology will utilise liquid salt as both fuel and coolant in the reactor core. This fully pumped molten salt loop tested key components including pumps, heaters, freeze valves, flanges, and instrumentation over time.",
            "In 2020, DOE selected the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) proposal, with Southern Company as the lead, as a winner of the ARDP risk-reduction pathway. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology. In February 2022, TerraPower and Southern Company finalised an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE at Idaho National Laboratory under the ARDP.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years.",
            "The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030. Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more than 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.”",
            "Nevertheless, US PacifiCorp, owner of the Kemmerer site, in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) considered the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities. TerraPower says it remains confident that the US supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035.",

I am pleased to announce our upcoming series, which will build on this progress by focusing on technology deployment. We look forward to working with US industry and our European partners on an agenda that will generate opportunities for US companies while helping our partners advance their energy and climate goals.”",
            "Over the next two years, USTDA says it will host four workshops in Europe and the US to promote industry-wide transatlantic partnerships and support decision-makers. The first workshop will be held this autumn at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. This follows a previous series of five workshops on SMR technology and civil nuclear energy regulations and standards in Europe. That series sought to bring together US and European public and private sector officials to focus on creating an enabling environment for SMR deployment in Europe.",

Bechtel Corporation was added to the project development team in May 2023. This multibillion-dollar project will also facilitate Poland’s transition away from coal-fired power. USTDA said the contract is one of the largest civil nuclear projects ever awarded to US industry and will support thousands of US nuclear power industry jobs.",
            "USTDA funded a FEED study in October 2022 to support Romania in deploying Europe’s first SMR. The grant to RoPower Nuclear, a subsidiary of the Nuclearelectrica SA followed from previous USTDA assistance and led to Romania’s selection in May 2022 of NuScale to provide its SMR technology. President Biden announced at the 2022 G7 Summit that USTDA had assembled a coalition of partners to fund the project’s vital FEED study phase, which is the next critical step to implementation.",
            "In December 2021, USTDA funded a licensing gap analysis for the Science & Technology Centre in Ukraine to facilitate the introduction of SMR technology. USTDA says its funding will provide Ukraine with a framework within which it can deploy SMR technology for its future energy security needs. NuScale is serving as the contractor for this activity.",
            "USTDA says it achieves its mission by funding feasibility studies, technical assistance and pilot projects that integrate US private sector innovation into infrastructure projects at the critical early stages when design choices and technology options are determined.

            "The companies both use modularity in their designs, NAAREA through modular manufacturing, Thorizon through its modular core made of molten salt cartridges produced offsite.",
            "NAAREA, founded in 2020 by Jean-Luc Alexandre and Ivan Gavriloff, is developing the XAMR molten salt fast neutron micro-generator (40MWe or 80MWt). NAAREA benefits from the support of the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) and French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), as well as industry players such as Assystem, Dassault Systèmes, Orano and Framatome.",
            "Dutch company Thorizon is developing a 250 MWt/100 MWe ‘thorium molten salt reactor’ that will use long-lived waste in combination with thorium as fuel. Thorizon is a spin-off from the Nuclear Research and consultancy Group (NRG), which operates the High Flux Reactor in Petten.",

It also complements Thorizon’s partnership with Orano to develop a production process for the re-use of used fuel.",
            "“This strategic industrial partnership will allow to speed up the development of molten salt and will create the conditions to build a European champion alliance in fast neutrons molten salt technology for the benefit of decarbonising urgently our planet,” said Jean Luc Alexandre, NAAREA founder & CEO. “I’m grateful to say that this collaboration will offer new perspectives on recycling spent fuels from conventional reactors. Thorizon has extensive expertise and has been working on their technology for many years, which is a strong asset for our partnership.”",

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has received a shipment of used next-generation light water reactor LWR) fuel from a commercial NPP to support research and testing for the first time in two decades. INL said it had received 25 experimental fuel rods irradiated in the reactor core of a commercial reactor. The fuel rods were developed and manufactured by Westinghouse Electric Company with technical assistance from several US national laboratories, including INL.",
            "Each fuel rod is 12 feet long, and the total shipment contains about 100 pounds of heavy metal, mostly uranium, INL noted. The shipment contains both accident tolerant fuel (ATF) and high burn-up fuel. Industry and DOE have collaborated over a decade to design ATF that offer enhanced safety performance during normal operations, mild operational transients and accident scenarios. High burn-up fuels take advantage of unrealised performance capacity available in advanced materials that can allow for extended operating cycles and/or increase the licensed power generation at existing NPPs while significantly reducing used fuel generation.",
            "These experimental fuels, designed for extended use and robust safety features, could deliver significant cost savings for consumers while increasing NPP resilience under potential accident conditions, INL said. However, first, researchers need to examine and analyse the fuel to evaluate how this advanced technology performed during normal usage. Researchers will conduct additional experiments to understand how the fuel performs under postulated accident conditions. Lastly, researchers will perform experiments to demonstrate behaviour during storage and recycling.",
            "Experts will analyse and test the fuel at INL’s Materials & Fuels Complex. There, experts will use remote manipulators in the nation’s largest inert-atmosphere hot cell to perform analyses and tests. Researchers will also subject the fuels to safety tests – simulations of power excursions or loss-of-cooling events in a controlled environment that are designed to push the fuel to its breaking points and beyond. “Safety testing for fuels is like crash testing for your car,” said Fabiola Cappia, the post irradiation examination department manager at INL. “You push it to the limit and beyond.”",
            "The data generated from these experiments and analyses are essential to establish the safety bases required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to allow the fuel’s use at more US NPPs. Researchers say the new fuel rods, when licensed for commercial use, could extend the amount of time a plant can operate between refuelling from 18 to 24 months.",
            "“Increased burnup, when combined with potential ATF-related uprates, could be a huge economic benefit to those plants and the fleet,” said Daniel Wachs, national technical director of DOE’s Advanced Fuels Campaign. “The increased electrical output in the US could be the equivalent of adding new reactors to the fleet.”",
            "“Continuous innovation is key to improving the nuclear sector’s reliability, especially at a time when energy demand is increasing and nuclear’s role is more vital than ever,” said Tarik Choho, Westinghouse President of Nuclear Fuel. “Westinghouse is proud to join efforts with INL and other partners in the production and testing of these advanced nuclear fuels.”",
            "Westinghouse and other nuclear fuel developers, in concert with national laboratories, have spent years developing new fuels for the existing nuclear reactor fleet. INL’s experiments and examinations of the fuel after time spent in a commercial nuclear reactor is one step in the qualification process.",
            "An earlier shipment of irradiated nuclear fuel rods with this new technology was delivered to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. The advanced testing and the post-irradiation examinations at both laboratories are key milestones to receive final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to deploy this innovative fuel to commercial reactors around the globe. The National Laboratories will provide valuable data to Westinghouse, the NRC, the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, as well as regulatory and scientific bodies in Japan, Korea, and Western Europe.",
            "“We wouldn’t be able to get across the finish line with these technologies if we couldn’t examine the rods,” said David Kamerman, a nuclear fuel research and development engineer at INL. “It’s a really big deal. There are not many places in the world that can do the work, and none of them match the capability of Idaho National Laboratory.”",
            "INL is also preparing the Advanced Test Reactor to accommodate fuels for endurance tests that mimic the wear and tear incurred over a decade of service in a commercial reactor in a fraction of the time. This step can support pursuing even higher burnup than that achieved in the commercial plant testing.",
            "Experts will also use the material to explore used fuel management approaches. The material will be examined to measure thermal and mechanical properties, data that is essential for understanding transportation and dry storage behavior. This work also includes demonstrating electrochemical recycling technologies as an option to recover and recycle valuable uranium and other fissile isotopes.",
            "“Receiving these fuel rods is a significant milestone for INL and the nuclear energy industry,” said INL Director John Wagner. As the nation’s nuclear energy research and development centre, we possess the unique facilities, capabilities and expertise to perform this vital research,” Wagner said. “Completion of this shipment, along with the state of Idaho’s reinstatement of the Department of Energy’s ability to receive up to 400 kilograms of commercial spent nuclear fuel per year at INL for research and development purposes, send a strong message that we are once again open for business. This has been a long time coming and I genuinely appreciate the state’s ongoing engagement with DOE to enable this critical work.”",

            "US-based Kairos Power has completed 1,000 hours of pumped salt operations after loading 12 tonnes of FLiBe molten fluoride into its Engineering Test Unit (ETU) at its testing and manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. FLiBe comprises a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1969.",
            "The ETU and will be used to inform the design, construction, and operation of Kairos’s Hermes low-power reactor that the company is using to advance the development of its planned fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (KP-FHR). ETU, the largest FLiBe molten salt system ever built, is a non-nuclear prototype of the KP-FHR that aims to demonstrate the integration of principal systems, structures, and components. Lessons learned from ETU will be integrated into Hermes and future iterations on the path to commercialising KP-FHR technology. This advanced 140 MWe reactor will use TRISO (TRI-structural ISOtropic) fuel in pebble form combined with a low-pressure fluoride salt coolant. The technology employs a steam cycle to convert heat from fission into electricity and to complement renewable energy sources.",
            "Kairos Power manufactured 14 tonnes of FLiBe for ETU at its Molten Salt Purification Plant in Elmore, Ohio. “Gaining experience with FLiBe production and operations is fundamental to taking risk off the table towards KP-FHR commercialisation,” said Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO. “Iterative development with real hardware systems like ETU 1.0 is a pillar of our strategy to deliver a clean, safe, affordable technology with true cost certainty and, when combined with in-house manufacturing, provides a unique opportunity to move quickly so we can make an impact in the fight against climate change.”",
            "The Hermes project is part of the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Programme. Kairos Power plans to operate the ETU for about five months before decommissioning the unit and constructing a second iteration, ETU 2.0. The company plans to build a third iteration in Oak Ridge in 2024 to lay the groundwork for Hermes operations starting in 2026. Kairos optimistically says the KP-FHR commercial reactor could be operational in the early 2030s.",
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) recently issued a construction permit to Kairos Power for the c proposed Hermes non-power test reactor to be built at the Heritage Center Industrial Park in Oak Ridge. The permit authorises Kairos to build a 35 MWt reactor that would use molten salt to cool the reactor core. Kairos will have to submit a separate application for an operating licence.",

These Radioisotope Power Systems (RPSs) have been flown by NASA since the 1960’s to provide reliable power and heat. Most spacecraft and devices use solar panels to generate power, but these have limitations for exploring the distant reaches of the solar system or for long-lived missions on other planets. Plutonium-238 (Pu-238), a non-weapons-grade radioactive material that generates large amounts of heat in its radioactive decay, offers another solution and source of power for complex space missions.",
            "This study will explore how nuclear reactors in Canada can be used to irradiate Neptunium-237 (Np-237) into Pu-238 and all costs associated with production, shipment, and extraction of the energy source. The goal is to understand if it is economically feasible for reactors in Canada to add Pu-238 to their existing fleet of isotope production, leveraging the already in-place infrastructure used for medical isotope production.",
            "“NPX always looks to operate in the intersection of Nuclear Energy and Innovation,” said Bharath Nangia, CEO of NPX. “This is going to be a rewarding and creative project, that has the potential to add a lot of value”.",
            "James Scongack, Chair of the CNIC Board noted that Canada is a “Tier 1 nuclear nation, and its isotope supply chain is one of the most profound in the world”. He added: “This feasibility study is aligned with our Isotopes for Hope Campaign launched in 2023 to assert Canada’s global leadership role in the use of isotopes to tackle our great challenges. Together our companies working with NPX hope to demonstrate another example of why radioisotopes are so important to modern society.”",

With the closure of the K-reactor at Savannah River Site in the late 1980s, the US lost its ability to produce plutonium-238 for space exploration. However, NASA and DOE agreed to re-establish a robust domestic supply chain of plutonium-238 in 2015 to ensure a reliable source of fuel for future missions.",
            "In the interim, plutonium-238 was supplied to the US directly from Russia. At a cost of some $2.5m per kilogram. However, this trade ended due to the restructuring of the Russian nuclear industry in 2009. Nevertheless, the stockpiled Russian plutonium-238 was enough to equip most American spacecraft for some time. DOE in 2013 set a target of starting production of its own product in quantities of at least 1.5 kg a year. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2015 produced the first US-produced Pu-238 in nearly three decades. The first NASA mission to use new plutonium-238 produced by DOE was NASA’s Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars in 2021 and continues to explore the surface of the planet today."

            "US-based BWX Technologies has been contracted by the US Department of Energy (DOE) to process thousands of kilograms of government-owned scrap material containing enriched uranium into High Assay Low Enriched Uranium (HALEU). The initial award will total $47m, with a total contract value of up to $116.5m, subject to annual congressional appropriations.",
            "HALEU fuel contains uranium enriched to 5-19.75% uranium-235 (higher than the 3-5% typically used in light water reactors). HALEU is required by most of the advanced reactor designs being developed under the DOE's Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. However, currently there is no commercial supply chain to support HALEU production and DOE has launched a programme to stimulate the development of a domestic supply.",
            "The scrap, that is unusable in its present form, will be processed to produce two tonnes of HALEU at BWXT’s facilities located near Lynchburg, Virginia. “The project will clear over two metric tons of scrap material from the Y-12 National Security Complex, contributing to ongoing efforts to reduce the material accountability and inventory totals at the site, while also supporting the Department’s advanced reactor demonstration projects,” said Jeff Chamberlin, Assistant Deputy Administrator for the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Material Management & Minimisation.",
            "BWXT will produce the HALEU over the next five years, with several hundred kilograms expected to be available as early as 2024.",
            "To support this programme, BWXT plans to hire approximately 20 new operators, engineers and safety personnel at its Lynchburg facility. The final product will be HALEU feedstock in an oxide form at an enrichment level of 19.75%. The scrap material to be provided by the NNSA is currently in a variety of forms and enrichment levels, and it has been collected by the government from a number of different sources, primarily at the Y-12 National Security Complex.",
            "The Y-12 National Security Complex is located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, near the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. It was built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project. The purpose of the Y‑12 Electromagnetic Separation Plant was to produce enriched uranium for the first nuclear bombs. The facility now operates as a manufacturing facility for nuclear weapons components and related defence purposes and produces fuel for the US Navy. According to DOE, Y‑12 “is a unique national asset in the manufacture, processing and storage of special materials vital to our national security and contributes to the prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction”. It is operated by Consolidated Nuclear Security led by Bechtel National. Other members include minority Leidos, ATK Launch Systems and SOC.",
            "Sharon Smoot, President of BWXT Nuclear Operations Group noted the growing interest in for both US national security and clean energy applications. “One of BWXT’s key roles in moving the nuclear industry forward is leveraging its specialty materials capabilities to support domestic HALEU needs for the next generation of nuclear reactors,” she said. “This contract adds to BWXT’s ongoing work with the NNSA to build the company’s HALEU production capabilities in support of converting high performance research reactors from highly enriched uranium to HALEU.”",

The facility, is an Office of Science scientific user facility operated by General Atomics in San Diego for the Department of Energy (DOE). It will now begin a series of major upgrades over the next eight months to prepare for the next phase of research. These scheduled upgrades are intended to keep the facility at the forefront of fusion science as a valuable resource for the entire fusion community.",
            "“The 2023 research campaign was one for the history books. I can’t remember a more productive effort, which is really a testament to the hard work of our wonderful team of scientists and engineers from across the country,” said DIII-D Director Dr Richard Buttery. “But it’s never a quiet time at DIII-D. We’re already getting started on an important set of upgrades as we look ahead to the next campaign.”",
            "The DIII-D tokamak, which has been in operation since the 1980s, is the largest magnetic fusion research facility in the US. It has played an important role in providing data for the engineering design phase of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), under construction in France. DIII-D supports more than 650 scientists from 95 institutions across the USA and the international research community.",
            "During the record-breaking campaign, which continued for more than 200 days, the most notable advances included:",
            "The demonstration of high performance “diverted negative triangularity” plasma configurations, which alter the shape of the plasma to improve performance and heat dissipation and potentially revolutionise the path to cost-effective fusion energy.",
            "The deployment of a new radio-frequency wave injection technology known as “helicon current drive” with an innovative antenna that improves the delivery of energy to the plasma, potentially creating a new method for efficiently sustaining plasmas in a more compact and cost-effective manner.",

            "As part of DIII-D’s commitment to developing the next generation of fusion scientists, the programme for the first time reserved two weeks of run time for student researchers. In total, 17 experiments were conducted by students pursuing PhD theses. DIII-D hosts over 200 students, interns, and postdoctoral research fellows annually.",
            "Many additional advances were made in the understanding of fusion plasmas, including improvements to efficiency, performance, and control. Findings from these and other areas of research will be announced in upcoming scientific journals and conferences.",
            "DIII-D has already begun a new upgrade effort which will improve its capabilities for shaping and containing plasma to increase plasma volume and current. These changes will allow DIII-D to reach higher performance levels relevant to fusion power plants and enable new research to improve plasma control and efficiency.",
            "The upgrades will include installation of a new divertor system, which is used to channel excess heat away from the edge of the plasma. The divertor is a permanently installed component in DIII-D that is critical for maintaining efficient plasma operations. Optimising the divertor to efficiently disperse heat without impacting the performance of the plasma is an important research goal for the DIII-D programme.",

As a first-of-a kind technology demonstration co-led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Plasma Science & Fusion Center (MIT PSFC) and General Atomics (GA), the Lower Hybrid system will give DIII-D additional capabilities to produce reactor-relevant plasma profiles. In theory, this approach should offer the most efficient mechanisms for increasing current drive.",

            "The US federal government and companies responsible for nuclear weapons production and atomic waste storage sites in the St Louis area in the mid-20th century were aware of health risks, spills, improperly stored contaminants and other problems but often ignored them, according to documents recently reviewed by The Associated Press (AP). AP, which is investigating the situation, says it receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.",
            "Federal health investigators have found an increased cancer risk for some people who, as children, played in a creek contaminated with uranium waste. AP examined hundreds of pages of internal memos, inspection reports and other items dating to the early 1950s, and found “nonchalance and indifference” to the risks of materials used in the development of nuclear weapons during and after World War II.",
            "This is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Missouri Independent, the non-profit newsroom MuckRock and AP. The government documents were obtained by outside researchers through the Freedom of Information Act and shared with the news organisations. The AP review did not uncover evidence of criminal wrongdoing but found repeated instances where companies, contractors or the government failed to address significant problems.",
            "Dawn Chapman of the activist group “Just Moms STL” which is pushing for clean-up and federal buyouts in the area, said the region “saved our country” with its work on the nuclear programme but paid a terrible cost. “We are a national sacrifice zone,” she said.",
            "St Louis was part of a geographically scattered national effort to build the nuclear bomb that was tested in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Much of the work in the area involved uranium, where Mallinckrodt Chemical Co was a major processor of uranium concentrate. In 1942, Mallinckrodt began processing uranium near downtown St Louis and in 1946, the government bought land near the airport and began trucking nuclear waste from the Mallinckrodt facility.",
            "Mallinckrodt stored barrels of K-65, a radioactive residue at the St Louis airport in deteriorating steel drums. In 1949, a Mallinckrodt memo shows, the company was aware the broken drums could result in runoff pollution to the nearby Coldwater Creek. But it determined the threat to workers from attempting to move the drums would be worse.",
            "In 1957, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) opened a plant in Weldon Spring and Mallinckrodt moved its uranium processing there. Radioactive waste contaminated the area, including a large quarry that eventually became a Superfund clean-up site in 1987. The rest of the Weldon Spring site was added two years later.",
            "In 1966, AEC demolished and buried buildings at the St Louis airport site. Continental Mining & Milling Co moved the waste to nearby Bridgeton, piling it in a heap, AEC said at the time. Radioactive barrels lay outside the fence. Storage was so haphazard that even the path to the site was contaminated by trucks that spread waste on their hauls from 1966 to 1969. At this site, uranium processor Cotter Corp dried the waste and shipped it to its facility in Colorado. The site remained contaminated for decades. In 1973, Cotter Corp took hazardous leached barium sulphate from the site and illegally dumped it in the West Lake Landfill, also in Bridgeton. The material contained uranium residue.",
            "Both the St Louis airport and Bridgeton sites are bordered by Coldwater Creek, which runs through the heart of what are now busy suburban neighbourhoods. Tonnes of the waste flowed into Coldwater Creek, contaminating the often-flooding waterway and adjacent gardens for 14 miles, state and federal investigators determined.",
            "In the late 1970s, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which replaced the AEC, flew a helicopter over the West Lake Landfill. It used gamma readings in an attempt to determine what parts of the landfill were contaminated with the radioactive waste the Cotter Corp had dumped there. The test correctly identified two contaminated areas but missed huge areas of the landfill. Despite warnings from the Missouri Department of Natural Resources and activists that the contamination was likely more widespread, the NRC’s conclusion stood for more than 40 years. However, earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced that contamination at the site was more widespread than previously thought.",
            "The government clean-up of Weldon Spring is complete, but the site will require monitoring in perpetuity. Rather than remove the waste, the government built a huge mound, covered in rock, to serve as a permanent disposal cell for much of the waste. The government said the site is safe, but some local residents remain concerned.",
            "AP said Federal officials plan to remove some of the waste at the West Lake Landfill and cap the rest. Clean-up of Coldwater Creek is underway but will continue until 2038. Clean-up has to date cost taxpayers more than $1bn and millions more will be needed.",
            "The AEC was abolished in the 1970s, in part because of public criticism of its handling of nuclear safety. The Department of Energy (DOE) is now responsible for overseeing the situation and has publicly detailed the environmental damage earlier waste mismanagement caused to people and the environment. The Army Corps of Engineers handles clean-up at several former nuclear programme sites, including in St Louis.",
            "Denise Brock’s father worked for years at Mallinckrodt. After he died of cancer in 1978 she lobbied for compensation and in 2003 founded the United Nuclear Weapons Workers. Her actions led the government to begin offering up to $400,000 to those who worked at nuclear facilities across the country and became ill. Over the past two decades, the government has paid out $23bn.",
            "However, while nuclear workers had direct exposure, many people who live near contamination sites were not told about the risks for decades. Chapman and Karen Nickel were so concerned about cancer and o",

In 2019, the federal Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry issued a report that found people who regularly played in Coldwater Creek as children from the 1960s to the 1990s may have a slight increased risk of bone cancer, lung cancer and leukaemia. Those exposed daily to the creek in the 2000s, when clean-up began, could have a small increased risk of lung cancer. People in the St Louis area are now pushing for legislation to compensate those who are sick. Others have sued those responsible for the waste.",
            "The earliest known public reference to Coldwater Creek's pollution came in 1981, when the EPA, the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention was advising residents to avoid Coldwater Creek entirely. A federal study found elevated rates of breast, colon, prostate, kidney and bladder cancers as well as leukaemia in the area. Childhood brain and nervous system cancer rates are also higher.",
            "Families who lived near Coldwater Creek were never warned of the radioactive waste. Details about the classified nuclear programme in St Louis were largely kept secret from the public. However newly discovered documents are now being reviewed by a collaboration of news organisations. The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and AP have spent months combing through thousands of pages of government records obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and interviewing dozens of people who lived near the contaminated sites, health and radiation experts, and officials from government agencies.",
            "Some of the documents, obtained by a nuclear researcher who focuses on the effects of radiation, had been declassified in the early 2000s. Others had been previously lost to history, packed away in government archives and not released publicly until now. All told, the documents from the AEC, DOE, NRC and EPA span 75 years.",
            "According to a draft report uncovered as part of the document release, four members of the health and safety research division of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee tested the St Louis airport site in 1976 at the request of the Energy Research & Development Administration, the predecessor to DOE. The results showed onsite radiation sources were as high as 8.8 millisievert a year, five times the typical dose of radiation humans receive in a year and nine times the EPA's limit for water pathways. The reading was 220 times higher than the EPA's limit for drinking water pathways.",

The fuel salt is FLiBe ( (fertile blanket of lithium-beryllium fluoride) with more than 99.95% Li-7 with fluorides of zirconium, uranium (HALEU: 19.75% U-235), and thorium. The coolant salt is also FLiBe and the cover gas is Argon. The moderator is nuclear graphite and the structural material is UNS N10003 superalloy.",
            "In future, a small modular reactor based on the LF1, as well as a fuel salt batch pyro-process demonstration facility, is planned. The TMSR-400 is designed as a thorium convertor and in situ burner driven by low enriched uranium. It will be used as a high temperature heat source, which can be used for electricity generation, but also for seawater desalination, heat supply, supercritical steam supply for industry demands and hydrogen production, etc.",
            "It will use mature technologies and experiences accumulated from TMSR-LF1 project and potential technologies to be developed in subsequent years. The primary loop is designed as a compact reactor module and can be replaced every 8-10 years to solve the long-term irradiation problems of materials. A pilot stage pyro-processing facility will be established in 2030s. The used fuel in TMSR-400 will be sent to the facility for fuel salt recovery and to minimise the radioactive inventory for disposal.",

The technology divides a physical space into cubes, each with a volumetric value of ionising radiation by dose. The data is then used to create a 3D image of gradient contours overlaid on a real-world view through an AR headset. This enables anyone wearing the headset to move through a physical space with visual awareness of the contours. The device calculates simulated, real-time exposure based on their movements.",

            "The Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (OREM) and contractor UCOR (United Cleanup Oak Ridge) are now focusing on soil and groundwater remediation at the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), according to the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Environmental Management (EM). This is the final stage in a clean-up programme that has dismantled more than 500 ageing, contaminated structures.",
            "For 40 years, the 2,200-acre ETTP hosted a complex of facilities that enriched uranium. Its origins lie in the World War II Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons and it operated until 1985. In addition to defence activities , the plant also produced enriched uranium for the commercial nuclear power industry. In 1987, DOE terminated uranium enrichment operations in Oak Ridge and closed the site permanently.",
            "This left ETTP with contaminated buildings, soil, sediment, and groundwater that required remediation to protect human health and the environment. In 1989, DOE formed EM to begin the clean-up in order to transform the site from a shuttered, government-owned former enrichment complex into a privately-owned, multi-use industrial park. In 2020, EM completed the core clean-up at the site – which included dismantling buildings and addressing major areas of soil contamination.",
            "With crews set to finish excavating and removing contaminated soil from the site next year, the focus is now turning to groundwater.",
            "“We’ve made great strides in reducing risks and restoring the environment at ETTP,” said OREM Regulatory Specialist Roger Petrie. “As we near completion on the remaining soil clean-up projects, groundwater remediation is the final effort to achieve our mission at the site.”",
            "ETTP is divided into three sections for groundwater remediation planning. One section is the Main Plant Area, which encompasses most of the operations area of the former enrichment complex. Another section is the area where the large K-31 and K-33 uranium enrichment buildings once stood. The third section, Zone 1, is the area immediately surrounding the Main Plant and the K-31 and K-33 areas. The US Environmental Protection Agency and Tennessee Department of Environment & Conservation recently approved OREM’s proposed plans for addressing groundwater in the Main Plant and K-31 and K-33 areas.",
            "The preferred approach for groundwater remediation in the Main Plant Area is enhanced in situ bioremediation. This widely used technology for treating contaminated waste involves injecting microorganisms and a carbon source, such as vegetable oil, into the ground. The microorganisms then reduce or detoxify the contaminants.",
            "“Because site conditions differ, no single remediation technology is applicable for all areas at ETTP,” said Kevin Ironside, UCOR Environmental Programs & Planning Manager. “A different approach is being recommended for the K-31 and K-33 area as the most effective means for addressing groundwater remediation.”",
            "For the K-31 and K-33 Area, OREM is proposing to use monitored natural attenuation and land use controls. Monitored natural attenuation relies on natural processes that reduce contaminant concentrations in groundwater. This involves monitoring groundwater conditions with land use controls limiting potential exposures. The proposed remedies for Zone 1 will be announced later.",
            "Over the past two decades, OREM has transformed the former uranium enrichment complex into a multi-use industrial centre, national park and conservation area. ETTP is now home to 25 businesses with more expected in the years ahead. It also hosts the Manhattan Project National Historical Park, and has a 3,000-acre conservation area for public use.",
            "The remaining soil and groundwater remediation required at the site is expected to continue until 2024. EM’s goals for ETTP are to:",

            "According to the ITER Organisation:",
            "“Fusion is a potential source of safe, non-carbon emitting and virtually limitless energy.”",
            "Per unit mass fusion can release nearly four times as much energy as nuclear fission reactions.",
            "Fusion fuels are widely available and are nearly inexhaustible. Deuterium (D) can be recovered from all forms of water, while tritium (T) may be produced during the fusion reaction as fusion neutrons interact with lithium.",
            "Like fission, fusion does not emit carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases – its major by-product is helium, an inert, non-toxic gas.",
            "Unlike fission, nuclear fusion reactors produce no high- level activity or long-lived nuclear waste and there are no enriched materials in a fusion reactor that could be exploited to make nuclear weapons. A Fukushima-type nuclear accident is not possible in a tokamak fusion device.",
            "Crucially, the average cost per kilowatt hour of electricity is also expected to be similar too fission – slightly more expensive at the beginning, when the technology is new, and less expensive as economies of scale bring the costs down.",
            "This list relates mainly to fusion produced by a tokamak device, such as that being built by ITER in southern France. Construction began in 2005 – based on a first-of-a-kind global collaboration. Europe is contributing almost half of the costs of its construction, while the other six members to this joint international venture (China, India, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the USA), are contributing equally to the rest. Tokamaks are the most common approach to confining the plasma needed for this type of fusion device. They use powerful superconducting magnets to hold the plasma in a ring-shaped (toroidal) vessel. The flow of the electrically charged plasma particles themselves also generates a magnetic field that helps to confine the plasma.",
            "However, there are other key fusion methods. In the 1950s, US astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer showed that magnetic fields could also be configured in a twisted loop – a device known as a stellarator. Initially tokamaks, developed by the USSR in the 1960s were deemed less complex until recently. Now the Wendelstein 7-X experimental stellarator has been built in Greifswald, Germany, by the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP) at a cost of $1.15bn It was completed in 2015. Then there is also inertial confinement, an idea which has also been around since the 1950s where the fusion plasma is not confined by magnetic fields. Instead, a shock wave compresses it to the immense densities needed. Among others, this approach is being studied at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where small capsules of D–T fuel are imploded using pulses of laser light.",
            "A lot of work is being done at the UK Atomic Energy Agency’s (UKAEA’s) Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE), where several major projects are underway. These include the Joint European Torus (JET) which is currently the world’s biggest and most powerful tokamak. It is the focal point of the European fusion research programme which feeds into ITER. CCFE’s MAST (Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak) Upgrade is an advanced tokamak experiment trialling a design for compact fusion devices known as spherical tokamaks. Finally, the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP) is an ambitious programme which aims to deliver an integrated design for a commercially-viable fusion power plant based on the spherical tokamak concept.",
            "Other government supported projects include South Korea’s Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor (KSTAR) at the National Fusion Research Institute (NFRI) in Daejeon and China’s Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) both of which, like JET, will feed into ITER. All these projects aim to produce a sustained fusion reaction and most have achieved various levels of fusion and over periods measured in seconds. There are several ambitious plans for follow-on devices (post-2050) that will demonstrate commercial fusion energy production. These include EuroFusion’s planned successor to ITER – DEMO; South Korea’s K-DEMO (in collaboration with US Department of Energy’s Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory) and China’s Fusion Engineering Test Reactor.",
            "Private enterprise pile on",
            "On top of these government initiatives, the number of private companies developing fusion concepts has grown rapidly in recent years. A survey earlier in 2022 by the Fusion Industry Association showed that investment in private fusion companies had more than doubled in the past year with eight new companies being founded, bringing the total to around 33. According to the survey, fusion companies declared more than $4.8bn of funding, up by 139% on 2021 and for the first time, private investment into fusion energy outstripped government funding.",
            "Some private fusion companies are developing scaled down tokamak designs such as Tokamak Energy which is looking at spherical tokamaks. Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) – spun out of the Plasma Science and Fusion Centre of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) – is developing high temperature superconducting magnets for the SPARC tokamak. Another university spin out, First Light Fusion from the UK’s University of Oxford, is developing inertial confinement using an electromagnetic projectile gun instead of lasers to compress the target.",
            "Canada’s General Fusion and UKAEA have initiated projects to advance the commercialisation of magnetised target fusion with the aim of building a demonstration machine at the Culham Campus in Oxford. This uses a centrifuge to spin a chamber filled with molten lead and lithium to open a cavity in the liquid metal, where the plasma sits. A piston system pumps more liquid metal into the chamber, compressing the plasma to initiate fusion. The process is repeated in pulses. TAE Technologies, a California start-up, plans to abandon D–T fuel and instead to fuse ordinary hydrogen with boron-11. Washington state start-up, Helion aims to generate electricity directly from fusion, without using the process to heat fluids and drive turbines. Helion plans to fuse a mixture of deuterium and helium-3. However, helium-3 would need to be produced by D–D fusion.",
            "While these private companies build on decades of state investment in larger projects some, such as Tokamak Energy, CFS and GF, are also benefitting directly with investment from the UK government and the US DOE.",
            "As research continues, there is a growing realisation that the claimed advantages fusion has over fission are not so clear cut.",
            "Undoubtedly, fusion reactors are more intrinsically safe than fission. As the fusion process is difficult to start and maintain, there is no risk of a runaway reaction or core meltdown. Fusion can only occur under strict operational conditions and in the case of an accident or system failure, the plasma will naturally terminate, lose its energy very quickly and extinguish before any sustained damage is done to the reactor.",
            "However, critics of fusion have indicated a number of potential problems that need to be addressed: the limited supply of lithium-6, beryllium and tritium; the problem of power drain; large amounts of intermediate- and low-level wastes (ILW and LLW) generated; and cooling. They also question the claim that there is no proliferation risk.",
            "Tritium is another key concern. While the hydrogen isotope deuterium can be extracted inexpensively from seawater, tritium is not at all readily available given a half-life of just over 12 years. It exists naturally only in trace amounts and nuclear reactors are required to produce it.",
            "Fusion scientists aim to solve this problem by breeding the tritium they need. The high-energy neutrons released in fusion reactions can split lithium into helium and tritium if the reactor wall is lined with a lithium blanket. However, a working fusion reactor is first needed to breed tritium in this way. Currently, the world’s only commercial sources are the 19 Canada Deuterium Uranium (Candu) reactors, which each produce about 0.5 kg a year as a waste product. Half of these reactors are approaching the end of their design life. Furthermore, unless new production methods can be developed the available tritium stockpile will steadily decline as fusion reactors like ITER begins burning the fuel.",
            "To date, tritium breeding has never been tested in a fusion reactor and its efficiency is unknown. In a recent simulation, nuclear engineers at the University of California found that, in a best-case scenario, a power-producing reactor could only produce slightly more tritium than it needs to fuel itself. Tritium leakage or prolonged maintenance shutdowns could further reduce this margin.",
            "Daniel Jassby, who was a principal research physicist working on fusion at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab until 1999, has detailed the problems facing fusion in several recent articles, noting that less than 10% of the injected fuel will be burned before it escapes the reacting region. “The vast majority… must therefore be scavenged from the surfaces and interiors of the reactor’s myriad sub-systems and re-injected 10-to-20 times before it is completely burned,” he says, adding that, in the two magnetic confinement fusion facilities where tritium has been used (Princeton’s Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor, and JET), approximately 10% of the injected tritium was never recovered.",
            "As to other drawbacks, Jassby says the neutron streams produced by fusion lead directly to four problems: radiation damage to structures; radioactive waste; the need for biological shielding; and the potential for the production of weapons-grade plutonium 239 – thus adding to the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation. In addition, fusion reactors share many of the problems that also face fission, “including tritium release, daunting coolant demands, and high operating costs”. Problems unique to fusion devices include unavoidable on-site power drains that drastically reduce the electric power available for sale as well as the limited availability of tritium.",
            "Fusion reactors consume much of the power they produce, leading to “parasitic power drain, on a scale unknown to any other source of electrical power”. Essential auxiliary systems external to the reactor must be maintained continuously even when the fusion plasma is dormant and when the fusion output is interrupted for any reason, this power must be purchased from the regional grid. Power is also needed to control the fusion plasma in magnetic confinement fusion and to ignite fuel capsules in pulsed inertial confinement fusion. If the fusion power is 300 MWe, the entire electric output of 120 MWe barely supplies on-site needs, he adds. “To have any chance of economic operation… the fusion power must be raised to thousands of megawatts so that the total parasitic power drain is relatively small”.",
            "A fusion reactor also places place immense demands on water resources for the secondary cooling loop that generates steam, as well as for removing heat from other reactor subsystems such as cryogenic refrigerators and pumps. Parasitic electric power drain places additional demands on water resources for cooling not faced by any other types of thermoelectric power plant.",
            "To produce usable heat, the neutron streams carrying 80% of the energy from deuterium-tritium fusion must be decelerated and cooled by the reactor structure, its surrounding lithium-containing blanket, and the coolant. The neutron radiation damage in the solid vessel wall is expected to be worse than in fission reactors. A number of components, such as the blanket and divertor, are expected to need to be replaced every 5–10 years.",
            "In addition, while the radioactivity level per kilogram of waste would be much smaller than for fission-reactor wastes, the volume would be many times larger. There is growing international recognition that this is a problem that needs to be addressed. A study published in Nuclear Fusion in May 2022 concluded: “A waste strategy needs to be developed to mitigate the impact that the large waste volumes could have on the public perception of fusion as a viable and clean alternative source of energy.” Also, this year the UK’s Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) produced a preliminary position paper on the implications for decommissioning, radioactive waste management, and radioactive waste disposal associated with fusion energy. It noted: “In addition to tritium emissions and contaminated materials, there will be a need to manage radioactive materials and wastes produced by neutron activation, within regulatory controls, over the whole life cycle of a fusion reactor.”",
            "Finally, there is the assertion that fusion does not pose a risk of nuclear weapons proliferation. Jassby points out that “the open or clandestine production of plutonium 239 is possible in a fusion reactor simply by placing natural or depleted uranium oxide at any location where neutrons of any energy are flying about”. Moreover, “a reactor fuelled with deuterium-tritium or deuterium-only will have an inventory of many kilograms of tritium, providing opportunities for diversion for use in nuclear weapons”.",
            "Fusion learning from fission",
            "A growing realisation of these problems, especially since the construction of ITER began in 2005, has led to an understanding that, rather than viewing fission as a competitor or “poor relation”, the fusion community could learn a lot from the decades of experience accumulated during the development of the nuclear power industry. There are synergies that could benefit both communities and common problems which could be tackled together, especially with the design and development of Generation IV advanced reactors.",
            "Articles to this effect began to appear in journals such as Fusion Science and Technology (2005 – Synergies Between Generation-IV and Advanced Fusion Power Plant Research Programs); Fusion Engineering and Design (2006 – Synergies between FNT developments and advanced nuclear fission technologies); and Revue Générale Nucléaire (2007 – Synergies between Fission and Fusion Nuclear Energy). All of these noted the need to develop new materials, problems of safety and regulation.",
            "The IAEA has been at the forefront of encouraging understanding of the synergies in technology development between nuclear fission and fusion for energy production, and on the long-term sustainability – including the handling of radioactive waste – and legal and institutional issues for fusion facilities.",
            "Early in 2022 (28 February – 3 March) a Kick-off Meeting was held on the IAEA’s International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO). A follow-up meeting took place in September.",
            "The overall objective of this inter-disciplinary study is to support the fusion community in its effort to accelerate the development and implementation of fusion-based facilities and integrated fusion-fission systems within the next decades, with the early identification of possible gaps in long-term sustainability and needed capabilities utilising INPRO assessments and analyses. The scope of work includes: review and critical analysis of previous experience in the development of national legislation and infrastructure; engagement with pioneering new fusion concepts; identification of the key issues for further analysis from the perspective of the use of INPRO tools and national approaches; and identification of relevant policy choices on a global and regional level in different scenarios.",
            "An IAEA Nuclear Energy Series Technical report or an IAEA TECDOC Series publication will be prepared in 2024 based on the results of the study. Achievement of the overall objective will be through cooperative work on cross cutting issues performed by the IAEA and INPRO member states along with inter-departmental IAEA cooperation.",
            "“What the INPRO study is doing is bringing together a lot of non-technical areas, learning from the experience of several of the nations that were represented,” Dr Sally Forbes from the UKAEA Culham Services Centre told NEI. “Because of the timeframe, with nuclear a lot of this work was done after the initial phases, whereas with fusion we are at a stage where we can learn now. Hopefully we can build a lot of these initial discussion into guidance to produce a common framework that can bring some harmonisation internationally at the beginning of the fusion journey rather than learning the lessons afterwards, as we did with nuclear.”",
            "For the nuclear industry, safety, security and safeguards are very well-established processes, and IAEA guidance in these areas is accepted worldwide. However, Dr Forbes pointed out that fusion has a much lower radiological hazard profile “We probably don’t need the full-blown nuclear regulation legislation guidance for fusion,” she said, adding that regulation needs to be proportionate and enabling for a technology that generally has a lower hazard profile but is very innovative. “Obviously it takes lots of components from nuclear but a lot of it is innovative. We are looking at whether nuclear regulation is appropriate.",
            "I am sure we will borrow lots of things from it, but many fusion nations are looking at this and perhaps deciding that we need a specific framework for fusion regulation,” says Forbes.",
            "She noted, for example, that the UK government had recently decided that fusion in the UK will be regulated as a radiological facility and not as a nuclear facility. “It still means we have to build guidance upwards,” she added, and this was part of the discussions at the INPRO meeting.",
            "“This will feed into the INPRO study – maybe looking at that proportionality and perhaps mixing between a nuclear framework and a radiological framework for regulating fusion.” It is about “learning the positive lessons from nuclear on how to have a very structured approach to safety and security and environmental protection but also learning where that might perhaps lead to over-engineering or extended time frames that are unnecessary for the level of hazard for fusion”.",
            "Fusion-fission collaboration",
            "In June, the IAEA hosted a week-long wide-ranging “Technical Meeting on Synergies Between Nuclear Fusion Technology Developments and Advanced Nuclear Fission Technologies”.",
            "The purpose of the event was to provide a forum for exchange of information as well as present up-to-date review of activities on synergies in technology development between nuclear fission and fusion for energy production at national and international levels. The discussions will feed into an IAEA Nuclear Energy Series publication which aims to provide insight on the areas covered as well as provide examples of good practices and lessons learned and offer suggestions to accelerate the transfer of technology, knowledge, and know-how from fission to fusion.",
            "Areas where there were deemed to be strong synergies and communalities between fusion and nuclear fission included development of fusion materials to withstand harsh service conditions and minimisation of radioactive waste hazards to reasonably achievable levels.",
            "Areas with moderate synergies and communalities between fusion and fission included:",
            "Fusion materials irradiation facilities under reactor-relevant conditions;",
            "Development of high temperature energy conversion systems;",
            "Computational tools, design and safety analyses codes;",
            "Regulatory sized for fusion energy facilities licensing;",
            "Reliable and feasible fuel cycle breeder material supply (lithium and lead);",
            "Remote handling and in-service inspection;",
            "Remote controllability, radiation hardened electronics and CAD-supported operations.",
            "In general, the meeting concluded that fusion could benefit from many relevant synergies with nuclear fission experience as well as commonalities in materials development, activated metals management, remote handling, and liquid metal. There are also development parallels between Generation IV advanced fission plants and commercial fusion facilities such as DEMO. While plant licensing and decommissioning and radwaste management for fusion may require a slightly different regulatory approach – due to the reduced hazard/risk potential – elements such as design, construction, operation and parts of the fuel cycle and plasma control for fusion facilities have many synergies with fission experience.",
            "Luigi di Pace, a consultant who worked on Fusion at Italy’s ENEA, told NEI that he believed there were good prospects for fusion and fission to work together. He noted that the fusion community was learning from the experience of nuclear in terms of design codes, safety codes and materials. “And I think in the future there will be synergies the other way round. Not only will fission help fusion but there will be some areas of expertise in which fusion can improve and advance technology in fission, in particular with respect to Generation IV reactors that are based on advanced technologies.” He added: “I’m not sure of the timeline – who will arrive first to a commercial technology. Probably it will be fission, but in the meantime there will be a bridge as both work towards a demonstrator plant. We really do not know when this will happen, but I think it will be in the middle of this century.”",
            "He believes the big issues and main commonalities between fusion and fission are materials and waste management as well as design codes, safety analysis codes and in service inspection. “Both fusion reactors and advanced fission reactors need to operate at high temperature. This means that materials and commercial system should be designed to operate at those high temperatures.”",
            "As to waste management, fission reactors will soon have to handle much more decommissioning as NPPs reach the end of their operating lives. “The real problem is not the high- level waste or used fuel but the huge amount of mildly- activated metals, and fusion may face the same problem. Unless they find some other solution, every five years the entire internals of the tokamak have to be replaced because of neutron damage, which means thousands of tonnes of material. Developing new materials can be helpful not only for fusion but also for advanced reactors, many of which will also face a large neutron flux. So there is a common interest to develop materials which are resistant to neutrons.”",
            "Tritium can also cause damage to materials. However, another commonality is that fission is needed to produce tritium. “For example, to start DEMO we will need a few kilograms of tritium. At the moment, this can only be produced by Candu reactors. The problem is that tritium decays, so you cannot store it for 20 years – it decays every 12 years”.",
            "Di Pace expressed some concern about the new enthusiasm for fusion sparked by the growing number of private companies in the field. “They have a lot of money and really they promise to have energy- electricity by 2030 while the governmental programmes are saying we will not have electricity before 2050. There are some doubts. They are developing new concepts for a fusion machine mainly focusing on concepts and on experiments.” At the same time, the larger government-backed projects are trying to solve the problems related to materials, fuel inventory and legal and regulatory issues.",
            "Di Pace noted that “when there is a strong driving force and also money, that is what drives these things. So really, I am quite confident that something will happen in the next two decades.” However, he added that it was important that the ITER experiment should be successful, “otherwise we have to reconsider everything”. He added: “I hope we will have a commercial reactor no later than 2070. If all goes well DEMO will begin construction in 2040. I hope the experience of JET and ITER will also produce something.” He said he expected to see some progress by the end of the decade. “This is my hope. I spent most of my career working on this, but I am getting older and probably will not survive to see the big event. But I am happy that our younger colleagues are also very enthusiastic. It is important to engage the new generation working in nuclear in both fusion and fission.”"

        "title": "Upgrade at Brookhaven National Lab increases actinium-225 production",
        "text": [
            "Following recent upgrades, the medical isotope facilities at the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is now producing actinium-225 (Ac-225) and shipping it directly to customers. Ac-225 is considered to have great potential in the treatment of cancer. It emits alpha particles, which can kill cancerous cells at short range is attach to molecules that target tumours. Ac-225 can also be used to generate bismuth-213, another alpha-emitter.",
            "“This upgrade will streamline the overall production and distribution of Ac-225 to research centres by eliminating the need to ship material off site for final processing,” said Cathy Cutler, Director of Medical Isotope Research & Production (MIRP) at BNL. MIRP scientists have been part of the DOE Isotope Programme “Tri-Lab” effort to produce Ac-225 (and Ac-225/Bi-213 generators) since 2014.",
            "Using powerful proton accelerators, scientists at Brookhaven and Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) irradiate targets made of thorium-232. transforming some of the thorium atoms into actinium-225. Both BNL and LANL have been shipping their irradiated targets to Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), which has the facilities to extract and purify the isotope.",
            "The Tri-Lab programme established reliable, routine Ac-225 production, and demonstrated that the process is scalable. However, the limited “hot-cell” space limited the quantities of Ac-225 that could be produced.",
            "In 2018, BNL and DOE team and DOE began refurbishing an old metallurgical laboratory that had been unused at Brookhaven since the 1990. An $8.5m investment from the DOE Science Laboratories Infrastructure programme made the renovation possible. The upgrade included retrofitting the obsolete hot cell facility and labs to create a new All-Purpose (AP) Hot Cell facility. “ORNL aided us in translating the process here. We also had to get special licensing and install new radiation-monitoring equipment,” Cutler said.",
            "Brookhaven’s new AP hot cells were completed in March and have doubled the number of Ac-225 processing sites for DOE’s Isotope Programme. This expanded processing capacity provides redundancy so BNL and ORNL can act as back-ups for each other.",
            "Scientists discovered actinium-225's in the 1960s when scientists at the DOE's Hanford Site were producing uranium-233 as a fuel for nuclear weapons and reactors. They shipped some of the uranium-233 production targets to ORNL for processing. The targets also contained thorium-229, which decays into actinium-225. In 1994, a team from ORNL began started extracting thorium-229 from the target material and eventually established a thorium \"cow”, from which they could regularly \"milk” actinium-225. In August 1997, the first delivery of actinium-225 was made to the National Cancer Institute.",
            "Scientists at ORNL \"milked” the thorium-229 cow six to eight times a year. They use a technique that separates out ions based on their charges. Unfortunately, the small amount of thorium-229 limits how much actinium-225 scientists can produce.",
            "The Tri-Lab project team began to look for alternatives to ORNL’s “cow” and BNL's medical isotope research and production programme seemed to be the answer. Only a few US accelerators create high enough energy proton beams to generate actinium-225. BNL's Linear Accelerator and LANL's Neutron Science Centre are two of them. While both mainly focus on other nuclear research, they create plenty of excess protons for producing isotopes.",
            "The actinium-225 production process starts with a target made of thorium that is bombarded with protons at about 40% the speed of light. As the protons hit thorium nuclei, they raise the energy of the protons and neutrons in the nuclei giving some enough kinetic energy escape the thorium atom. In addition, some of the excited nuclei split in half. The process of expelling protons and neutrons as well as splitting transforms the thorium atoms into hundreds of different isotopes including actinium-225.",
            "After 10 days of proton bombardment, scientists removed the target and allowed short-lived radioisotopes can decay, reducing radioactivity. They then removed it from its initial packaging, analyse it, and repackaged it for shipping to ORNL for further processing. This last step is no longer needed with the BNL upgrade.",

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) says the Oak Ridge Office of Environmental Management (OREM) and its clean-up contractor, UCOR (United Cleanup Oak Ridge) have begun tearing down the Low Intensity Test Reactor (LITR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). The training reactor, also known as Building 3005, was built in 1951 and operated until 1968. It was built as a mock-up of the Materials Test Reactor that was being constructed at the Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "“We’re pleased to make headway on the removal of this old reactor facility, which is an EM priority for 2023,” said Nathan Felosi, ORNL portfolio federal project director. “Our progress is helping eliminate hazards and open land for reuse at ORNL.” The project follows the recent demolition of the Bulk Shielding Reactor, which marked the first removal of a former reactor from ORNL’s central campus area. It was adjacent to LITR.",
            "The demolition required nearly five years of planning and deactivation work. Employees identified structural concerns associated with the facility that posed significant challenges to standard deactivation and demolition practices. As workers",
            "removed the concrete shield blocks around the reactor, they discovered the slab floor structures were not adequately supported, creating a potentially unstable work environment.",
            "“Great kudos to our workers in the field for discovering the structural concerns, pausing the work, and bringing it to the attention of our management team and engineers, allowing the project to remain safe,” said Dan Macias, ORNL site integration and clean-up manager.",
            "Additional factors complicated the process. In some cases, the facility’s original drawings did not include all the information necessary to help inform workers as they undertook characterisation. This determines the types and levels of contamination in and around a facility to support work planning, worker safety and waste management. High-tech equipment was used to detect radiological material that had not been previously documented in some areas of the facility.",
            "Crews are currently taking down ancillary facilities. The goal is to demolish all structures surrounding the reactor, remove and sample additional shield blocks to support waste disposal and tear down and package the reactor for transport and disposal. This work will continue through the spring and summer with completion set for later this year. To date UCOR workers have completed demolition on the west side of the LITR including the west laboratory and two water tank structures on the north side. They are now working their way around the east side to pull down the east laboratory."

The agreement was signed during a Bapeten Executive Meeting on NPP licensing.",
            "Bapeten said the Government of Indonesia has committed to carry out an energy transition to reduce the greenhouse effect and achieve Net Zero Emissions by encouraging research and development of new energy-based power generation technologies and renewable energy. The government is targeting 8 GWe of installed capacity from nuclear power plants by 2035 increasing to 35 GWe in 2060.",
            "The plant is to be located at Kelasa Island in the Province of Bangka-Belitung. ThorCon said the goal of the consultation is “to prepare the regulator, the applicant, and the stakeholders for the formal licensing process”. It will also “create a roadmap that contains schedules, roles and responsibilities, applicable laws and regulations, scope and format of the technical and administrative documents in the licence applications, and evaluations of the design readiness”. The consultation is expected to take 12 months. “We intend to submit licence applications following the conclusion of the consultation,” ThorCon said.",
            "ThorCon says its TMSR-500 design “will provide the low-cost dispatchable electricity that the Indonesian economy needs to grow and flourish”. ThorCon claims that “with its black start capability and scalability, our plants can be used to make the Indonesian grid more robust and attract foreign companies to set up operations in Indonesia”. The company says it intends to establish an assembly line “which will manufacture our nuclear power plants in Indonesia”. It adds: “We are also working with several universities to create programmes regarding molten salt reactor technology. These activities will not only create a new industry in the national economy, but they will also help transform Indonesian power generation into one of the cleanest on the planet.”",
            "ThorCon has been promoting its technology to key Indonesian institutions since 2015, the year that, Indonesia decided to cancel its $8bn plans to construct four nuclear plants with a total capacity of 6GWe by 2025. In 2014, ThorCon’s parent company Florida-based Martingale, had completed the preliminary detailed design of a molten salt reactor, technical details of which were published at thorconpower.com “It is the basis for securing feedback, funding, and siting for the project,” it said, adding that “the goal for 2015 is to identify a host country and site for construction of the non-nuclear prototype ThorCon, along with funding to enable construction”.",
            "In January 2015 Martingale formally unveiled its ThorCon liquid-fuel nuclear reactor design, which uses uranium and thorium fuel dissolved in molten salt, and these same details are now available on the ThorCon website. At that time, production was expected to start by 2020. ThorCon’s initial approach to Indonesia took place in October 2015 when the Indonesia Thorium Consortium signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Martingale to develop thorium molten salt reactors (MSRs). ThorCon's statement said Indonesia planned to commission its first such reactor in 2021. The consortium comprised PT Industry Nuklir Indonesia (INUKI), the state-owned nuclear fuel processing company; PT PLN, a state-owned power generation company; and PT Pertamina, the state oil and gas company.",
            "In the subsequent years ThorCon signed a raft of further agreements. State shipbuilding company PT PAL Indonesia agreed to conduct a development study and build a 500MWe plant as EPC contractor which would be placed on a 185-metre-long barge built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in Okpo, South Korea and then towed to a site in Indonesia.  Indonesia’s Defence Ministry signed a MOU with ThorCon to study developing a thorium molten salt reactor for either power generation or marine vehicle propulsion. The ministry aimed to have an operational molten salt reactor by 2025 to generate electricity or power ships and submarines. ThorCon also said it would provide technical support to develop “a small-scale TMSR (thorium molten salt reactor) under 50 MW\" to “strengthen national security in the outermost, frontier and least developed regions”.",
            "However, Dandang Purwadi, director of National Nuclear Energy Agency (Batan), which had never shown much enthusiasm for the ThorCon project, told The Jakarta Post that thorium nuclear technology is not yet ready for commercial application. “We have to wait around 10 years for the technology to mature, then it takes 10 years to build the facility”, he said.",
            "Undeterred, in January 2022, ThorCon named Spanish engineering firm Empresarios Agrupados (EA) as architect engineer for the TMSR-500 and six months later reached agreement with the National Research & Innovation Agency (BRIN to jointly develop and build an experimental NPP based on molten salt reactor technology. An agreement with inspection and certification company Bureau Veritas (BV) followed in December 2022. It was anticipated that the Technology Qualification process would take a minimum of three years and if successful, the deployment phase would require an additional two years bringing implementation to 2027.",
            "ThorCon’s website notes that its power plant “is a straightforward scale-up of the successful United States Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). A full-scale 500 MW ThorCon prototype can be operating under test within four years. After proving the plant safely handles multiple potential failures and problems, commercial power plant production can begin.” However, MSRE was shut down in 1969 and is now being prepared for dismantling. While there is now renewed interest in MSR technology in the US and elsewhere, there are no projects anywhere in the world near realisation – and that includes ThorCon, in spite of its growing list of agreements and MOUs.",
            "Several stakeholders were present at the Bapaten meeting including the Ministry of Maritime & Investment Coordination, the Ministry of Energy & Mineral Resources, the National Development Planning Agency, the Ministry of Investment, the National Energy Council, National Research & Innovation Agency, BPPD Bangka Belitung Islands, PT PLN, PT Indonesia Power, PT ThorCon Power Indonesia, PT Bureau Veritas Indonesia and Gajah Mada University as well as Nuclear Engineering Empresarios Agrupados.",
            "Bapaten Chief Sugeng Sumbarjo explained that the Executive Meeting was an effort to create efficient and licensing practices practicable for existing business actors investing nuclear power plants in Indonesia. “We accommodate all permits but prioritise aspects of nuclear security and safety,” he said. At the end of the event the Terms of Reference were signed for the 3S Consultation and submission by PT ThorCon Power Indonesia of related documents including a feasibility study for the TMSR500 and the proposed schedule.

These materials will be tested at ORNL and at UKAEA’s Materials Research Facility at Culham Campus in Oxfordshire. The research conducted will attempt to understand how certain materials respond to irradiation over extended periods, in order to increase the longevity of materials in fusion plants.",

        "text": [
            "US-based X-Energy Reactor Company plans to open its first Xe-100 reactor fleet management, monitoring, and training facility in Frederick, Maryland. This Plant Support Centre-East (PSCE) is seen as the first step in X-energy’s Commercial Operations Services business. It will support the initial deployment of SMRs.",
            "X-energy CEO J Clay Sell said the centre “is just the starting point of our advanced nuclear reactor fleet support strategy and a significant part of X-energy’s business growth”. He added: “Modernising and centralising fleet services will help drive the cost-competitiveness of our Xe-100 technology as well as establish the potential for a sustainable, long-term business that generates consistent and recurring revenue for X-energy.”",
            "The PSCE is intended to support training and operations for that plant, as well as subsequent owners and operators of the first Xe-100 plants. X-energy says that, as the Xe-100 fleet grows, regional centres will be expanded to provide support services to Xe-100 owners and operators. These will offer business services in areas such as plant diagnostics, maintenance planning, outage scheduling, supply chains, human resources, and regulatory compliance.",
            "This builds on more than two years of work in partnership with the US Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy (ARPA-E) and the US Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI). This work aims to develop an innovative “digital-twin” maintenance lab and a US-based, continuous fleet monitoring and diagnostics initiative. In 2020, DOE selected X-energy to receive up to $1.2bn of federal cost-shared funding to develop, license, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors by the end of the decade.",
            "The PSCE will comprise a high-fidelity main control room simulator that integrates real-time plant instrumentation and control systems with X-energy’s 3-D virtual reality environment. X-energy says it is combining this technology with artificial intelligence and machine learning into a suite of proprietary tools called Xe-100 Data Analytics Tools & Applications (X-DATA). This aims to improve reliability as well as reduce predictive and preventative maintenance costs for X-energy’s customers.",
            "The Xe-100 is a high-temperature gas reactor with a thermal output of 200 MWt or an electrical output of 80 MWe. It is one of two designs selected by DOE in 2020 to receive $80m each of initial cost-shared funding to build an advanced reactor demonstration plant that can be operational within seven years. The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa.",
            "It will use TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprising three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. DOE says TRISO is “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth”. Since 2016, X-energy subsidiary TRISO-X has operated a pilot-scale nuclear fuel fabrication facility (TF3) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to further develop its TRISO-X fuel and support the Xe-100 reactor.",
            "X-energy, which expects its first reactor to be operational in 2028, recently announced plans to install its first Xe-100 at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites. The first commercial deployment of the Xe-100 had previously been expected to be a four-unit plant near Energy Northwest's Columbia NPP in Washington. Energy Northwest CEO Bob Schuetz said the company remains committed to deploying an advanced SMR in Washington state by the end of the decade, and that the Xe-100 is its preferred technology.",
            "Energy Northwest noted that it does not have the \"significant development capital\" to initiate the project without a committed off-taker, compared with a company such as Dow. However, working collaboratively with Dow \"will put us in a strong position to gain the commitments necessary to take the next steps to build an Xe-100 in central Washington,\" the company said, adding \"our focus is on securing project financing, and we have identified several viable pathways to successfully execute this project\".",
            "He added: \"As X-energy demonstrates its technology alongside Dow as part of ARDP, we will support and learn from their work to optimise, deliver, and develop future projects together. Working collaboratively to deploy multiple advanced reactors in a short timeframe will be beneficial to both Dow and Energy Northwest, as well as to the entire advanced nuclear industry.\"",

        "text": [
            "Researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and other institutions have developed a remote test that can produce key information about the condition of stainless-steel reactor components, minimising outage time. The findings are reported in the journal Acta Materiala in a paper by MIT professor of nuclear science and engineering Michael Short; Saleem Al Dajani (who did his master’s work at MIT on this project and is now a doctoral student at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia); and 13 others.",
            "The team included researchers at MIT, Idaho National Laboratory, Manchester University and Imperial College London (UK), Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, Northeastern University, the University of California at Berkeley, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. The work was supported by the International Design Center at MIT and the Singapore University of Technology and Design, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the US National Science Foundation.",
            "Currently such testing requires removing test pieces of the same kind of steel that are left adjacent to the actual components to experience the same conditions, or removal of a tiny piece of the operating component. Both are done during shutdowns of the reactor, prolonging these scheduled outages and costing millions of dollars a day.",
            "The new test involves aiming laser beams at the stainless-steel material, which generates surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on the surface. Another set of laser beams is then used to detect and measure the frequencies of these SAWs. Tests on material aged identically to NPPs showed that the waves produced a distinctive double-peaked spectral signature when the material was degraded.",
            "Short and Al Dajani began their research in 2018, looking for a more rapid way to detect a specific kind of degradation, called spinodal decomposition. This can take place in austenitic stainless steel, which is used for components such as the pipes that carry coolant water to and from the reactor core. This process can lead to embrittlement, cracking, and potential failure in the event of an emergency.",
            "While spinodal decomposition is not the only type of degradation that can occur in reactor components, it is a primary concern for the lifetime and sustainability of nuclear reactors, Short said.",
            "“We were looking for a signal that can link material embrittlement with properties we can measure, that can be used to estimate lifetimes of structural materials,” Al Dajani noted.",
            "They tried a technique Short and his students and collaborators had expanded upon, called transient grating spectroscopy (TGS) using samples of reactor materials known to have experienced spinodal decomposition as a result of their reactor-like thermal ageing history. Laser beams were used to stimulate and measure SAWs on a material. It was assumed that decomposition should slow the rate of heat flow through the material and the slowdown would be detectable by the TGS method. However, no such slowdown was detected. Short said: “You go in guns blazing, looking for a certain thing, for a great reason, and you turn out to be wrong. But if you look carefully, you find other patterns in the data that reveal what nature actually has to say.”",
            "Instead, what showed up in the data was that, while a material would usually produce a single frequency peak for the material’s SAWs, in the degraded samples there was a splitting into two peaks. “It was a very clear pattern in the data,” Short recalls. “We just didn’t expect it, but it was right there screaming at us in the measurements.”",
            "Cast austenitic stainless steels used in reactor components are duplex steels – a mixture of two different crystal structures in the same material by design. While one is quite impervious to spinodal decomposition, the other is quite vulnerable t. When the material starts to degrade, the difference shows up in the different frequency responses of the material. The team carried out further tests, which continued to strengthen the significance of the results.",
            "“Our discussions with those who opposed our initial hypotheses ended up taking our work to the next level,” Al Dajani says. The tests they did used large lab-based lasers and optical systems. The next step is miniaturising the whole system into something that can be an easily portable test kit to use to check reactor components on-site, reducing the length of shutdowns. “We’re making great strides, but we still have some way to go,” he said. “Every day that your nuclear plant goes down, for a typical gigawatt-scale reactor, you lose about $2m a day in lost electricity,” he noted, “so shortening outages is a huge thing in the industry right now.”",
            "Short hopes the new technique could help to enable the extension of NPP operating licences for some additional decades without compromising safety, through the frequent, simple and inexpensive testing of the key components.",
            "The team included researchers at MIT, Idaho National Laboratory, Manchester University and Imperial College London (UK), Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Electric Power Research Institute, Northeastern University, the University of California at Berkeley, and King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia.

        "text": [
            "To meet the anticipated near-term demand from SMR developers for the transportation of large quantities of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel, new types of packaging systems are being developed by suppliers. NAC International’s continuing efforts to broaden the capabilities of their packagings show promise.",
            "NAC had initially developed the OPTImal Modular Universal Shipping (OPTIMUS®) packagings to provide a fiscally and operationally efficient alternative for radioactive material transportation campaigns that relied on the existing packaging options such as large Type B packages or smaller, drum-size Type B packagings. Type B materials present a radiation hazard to the public or the environment and so a Type B package design must demonstrate an ability to withstand normal shipping conditions, but also severe accident conditions without releasing the contents. These Type B materials include intermediate level waste (ILW), transuranic waste (TRU), irradiated fuel waste (IFW), reactor components, experiment wastes, pool debris and reactor products (e.g., sources, irradiated materials, etc.).",
            "The technology has continued to develop and the company has revised the design of its OPTIMUS® transport packaging systems to support HALEU transport and other fuels that are set to power the SMR revolution.",
            "Transforming effectiveness",
            "The versatility of the OPTIMUS® systems are inherently fundamental to their designs. The OPTIMUS®-L and the OPTIMUS®-H both utilize the same interchangeable Cask Containment Vessels (CCVs) and Shield Insert Assemblies (SIAs). Both types of packagings are configurable with multiple shield inserts, balancing the need for radiation shielding with a minimal shipping weight.",
            "The OPTIMUS®-L packaging configuration is used for low-activity contents such as contact handled TRU waste, high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), and low enriched uranium (LEU). The OPTIMUS®-H configuration is used for high activity contents such as remote handled TRU waste, LEU and fissile material.",
            "Through the continued expansion of research and design efforts, NAC has developed various content-specific engineered inserts and baskets, further transforming the flexibility and usefulness of the OPTIMUS® systems.",
            "The OPTIMUS® packagings are capable of transporting a wide array of radioactive materials, equipment, wastes, fresh fuels, and spent fuels of various activities. Currently designed inserts enable the safe and effective transport of everything from sealed sources to fissile materials such as Intermediate and High-Level Wastes, Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) and Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) including High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU)/TRISO fuels.",
            "The OPTIMUS® systems are well-suited to support ongoing defueling and decommissioning efforts across the U.S. and abroad, but more importantly are on the cutting edge of safe and reliable transportation to support a variety of developing technologies, including the Unites States’ innovative space missions and HALEU development programs.",
            "These small, light modular packages are easily handled and are ideal for facilities with restricted access and/or low crane capacity. The packagings are designed to support legal weight truck (LWT) shipments and can be used in multiple transport configurations.",
            "In 2020 NEI forecast the nation’s HALEU demand at 137 tonnes in 2030 and 501 tonnes in 2035. The DOE recently committed US$5bn in funding to demonstration projects for the deployment of advanced reactors. These reactors, through the use of HALEU fuels, are smaller, more efficient plants with longer operating cycles compared to our current commercial fleet of BWR and PWR LEU reactor designs.",
            "NAC funded an internal research and development (R&D) project in order to have pre-approved, certified packaging configurations available for HALEU contents. NAC performed the R&D to proactively support the development program and demonstration projects. Through this early expansion of the technology, NAC will help to mitigate potential packaging and transportation schedule delays to ensure the safe and effective transportation of fuels and fuel materials to maintain both HALEU fabrication and programme momentum.",
            "NAC has recently completed design on inserts and baskets for the OPTIMUS® systems to accommodate the transport of various types of fissile materials and is currently developing inserts for solid fuel materials including TRISO compacts and pebbles. Existing NAC-engineered systems can enable thousands of TRISO compacts to be transported per legal weight truck shipment, and analyses demonstrate subcriticality (keff + 2σ ≤ 0.95) with significant margin for both dry and flooded conditions.",
            "In June 2022, NAC International received a patent on the design production method for its OPTIMUS® transportation packages from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.",
            "This is recognition of the original thinking that went into the development of this unique transportation system. The continued evolution of the now-patented Type B transport package product line includes the engineering and development of additional design, package, and content configurations of the technology to accommodate larger payloads while still maintaining the adaptability of the systems.",
            "Through the perpetual integration of lessons learned during the initial and ongoing OPTIMUS® program development, packaging operations, and NAC’s keen engineering and design efforts, we intend to continuously optimize the technology to enable the transport of required materials and fuels to support further industry advancement.",
            "Both OPTIMUS®-L and the OPTIMUS®-H are certified by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) under IAEA SSR-6 for shipments within Canada to support Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) missions. The OPTIMUS®-L is also certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) under 10 CFR 71 while the OPTIMUS®-H is currently being reviewed by NRC.",
            "Today, NAC is also in the final design and licensing stages of the newly developed OPTIMUS®-XL to accommodate dimensionally larger payloads with greater activities and dose rates. NAC is also in the theoretical design phase of another package for the OPTIMUS® product line, the OPTIMUS®-S, for micro-reactor transportation and other intermediate payloads. Both developing systems will be designed for legal weight truck transportation of radioactive materials and systems.",
            "Benefits of handling a lighter package",
            "The small size and weight of the OPTIMUS®-L packaging simplifies handling operations within a facility. Combined with its relatively large cavity size, payload weight capacity, and the ability to transport several packages on a single LWT shipment means it is suitable as packaging for transportation of different forms of HALEU fuels. This includes HALEU feedstock in the form of UO2 powder and TRISO compacts made from HALEU feedstock.",
            "An independent evaluation of the OPTIMUS®-L packaging performed through a collaboration of Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and funded by the Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Technology Research and Development (NE-4) confirmed a single legal weight truck (LWT) shipment of OPTIMUS®-L packages will transport 250% of the UO2 HALEU contents than is possible with an alternative, more traditional Type B(U)F packaging.",
            "The attractiveness of the OPTIMUS® systems is their ease of operation. To date, all of the developed and proposed OPTIMUS® systems are designed for LWT on any standard 48’-53’ flatbed trailer, do not require over-height or over-width permitting, are easily handled by fork lift truck, and can safely and effortlessly be operated by a single technician.",
            "In the last three years, NAC has fabricated and deployed over 26 OPTIMUS systems in conjunction with over 20 basket and insert assemblies. NAC is fabricating four additional systems and two shield insert assemblies to be delivered by Q4 2022. In addition, the two new OPTIMUS® package designs and several engineered basket assemblies are currently in the pre-approval planning and design phase with an anticipated 2024 deployment window.",
            "In September 2022, the OPTIMUS®-L successfully executed its first domestic waste shipment to Waste Control Specialists (WCS) in Andrews, Texas, through Bionomics, Inc. (Bionomics), an Oak Ridge, Tennessee turn-key waste management company. John McCormick, Vice-President of Bionomics said, “In our work with the SCATR (Source Collection and Threat Reduction) Program, the importance of using the OPTIMUS® is obvious. The ease of handling and operation of the system, and the lower costs associated with its use in moving these devices will be paramount moving forward. There was a lot of planning and thought put into moving just this one device, but it was worth it.”",
            "Today, NAC is in the final design and licensing stages of the newly developed OPTIMUS®-XL to accommodate dimensionally larger payloads with greater activities and dose rates. NAC is also in the theoretical design phase of another package for the OPTIMUS® product line, the OPTIMUS®-S, for micro-reactor transportation and other intermediate payloads.

            "Denmark's Copenhagen Atomics has applied for its containerised small modular thorium molten salt reactor design to undergo Generic Design Assessment (GDA) in the UK.",
            "UK Atomics, a subsidiary of the company applied to the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) for a GDA by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (EA). This assessment aims to assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of any nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in the UK.",
            "In May 2021, BEIS opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the EA. Rolls-Royce SMR was the first vendor to submit an application for a GDA of an SMR design. Its 470 MWe pressurised water reactor design was accepted for review in March 2022. In December, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR, and Holtec International has stated its intention to submit an application for its SMR-160 design.",
            "UK Atomics molten salt reactor design uses unpressurised heavy water as a moderator, while the reactor is intended to burn nuclear waste while breeding new fuel from thorium. The company says, with an output of 100 MWt, it is small enough to allow for mass manufacturing and assembly line production.",
            "UK Atomics CEO and co-founder Thomas Steenberg said the technology “has the added benefit of producing no greenhouse gas emissions and it does consume long-term nuclear waste from the classic nuclear industry to produce energy”. A mock-up of the reactor has been constructed at the company’s facility in Copenhagen which \"will be tested to support the goal-oriented approval process\".",
            "Copenhagen Atomics claims that the reactors will be deployed by UK Atomics, which will build, own and operate a fleet of autonomous reactors, \"eventually numbering in thousands\". This business model, selling energy-as-a-service, will enable a cost-effective and low-risk deployment, it says. The timeline it has set for operation of its first commercial reactor is 2028. The company further claims that, with low operating costs and no capital expenditure to the customer, it projects an electricity price below £40 ($48) per MWh.",
            "\"We are removing the complexity for decision makers,\" said Copenhagen Atomics cofounder Thomas Jam Pedersen. \"Companies fear the responsibility of operating a nuclear plant, decommissioning, and handling nuclear waste. We take care of all of that and just deliver reliable and green energy to the customer.\"",
            "The company was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists and engineers meeting at Technical University of Denmark and around the greater Copenhagen area for discussions on thorium and molten salt reactors, who incorporated in 2015. The following year, the company became part of European nuclear molten salt research consortium MIMOSA.",
            "Copenhagen Atomics currently markets some of their technologies commercially including pumped molten salt loops for use in molten salt reactor research, as well as highly purified salts for high temperature concentrated solar power, molten salt energy storage, and molten salt chemistry research.",
            "Recently the company raised €20m ($21.2m) to accelerate the development of its thorium molten salt reactor technology. Pedersen said the funding will support its plans to have the first commercial reactors online in 2028. The company says it is planning to test a prototype in Copenhagen in 2023. However, according to the company website, it planned non-radioactive testing of its prototype in 2022 and would then identify a country to test the radioactive version in preparation for mass production on assembly lines in 2030.",
            "According to Pederson, the company has specialised in producing molten salts, particularly fluoride salts, which are being used for early-stage testing of reactor components. Radioactive testing will not take place in Denmark, which has no state agency able to approve that sort of research. “I don’t know exactly which country will be the best for us,” he said, noting that Canada, the USA, and other European countries are all on the table.",
            "The company notes that molten salt reactors are not a new concept as they underwent significant testing in the 1950s and 1960s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fuelled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants, one of which was a molten salt breeder reactor with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation.",
            "According to Pederson, testing stopped in part because thorium was not well-suited for weapons production. “It was, from the very get-go, far behind the investments in the uranium fuel cycle, and therefore, most people were educated in the uranium fuel cycle,” he said. However, in the late 2000s documents from the ORNL tests were released to the public. “People started to discover, ‘Oh, there’s actually something here that is quite exciting.’ Because thorium is the only element where you can make a breeder cycle, or breeder reactor, in thermal spectrum.”",
            "While there is now renewed interest in MSR technology with numerous designs being developed in the US, Europe and Russia, there are, as yet, no projects anywhere near realisation."

            "Inspection and certification company Bureau Veritas (BV) recently signed an agreement with nuclear power technology developer ThorCon for the Technology Qualification and subsequent development of a 500MW molten salt nuclear power barge intended for operations in Indonesia. Thorcon has been promoting its technology to key Indonesian institutions since 2015, the year that, Indonesia decided to cancel its $8bn plans to construct four nuclear plants with a total capacity of 6GWe by 2025.",
            "In 2014, Thorcon’s parent company Florida-based Martingale, completed the preliminary detailed design of its molten salt reactor, technical details of which were published at thorconpower.com “It is the basis for securing feedback, funding, and siting for the project,” it said, adding that “the goal for 2015 is to identify a host country and site for construction of the non-nuclear prototype ThorCon, along with funding to enable construction”. In January 2015 Martingale formally unveiled its ThorCon liquid-fuel nuclear reactor design, which uses uranium and thorium fuel dissolved in molten salt, and these same details are now available on the Thorcon website. At that time, production was expected to start by 2020.",
            "Thorcon’s initial approach to Indonesia took place in October 2015 when the Indonesia Thorium Consortium signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Martingale to develop thorium molten salt reactors (MSRs). ThorCon's statement said Indonesia planned to commission its first such reactor in 2021. The consortium comprised PT Industry Nuklir Indonesia (INUKI), the state-owned nuclear fuel processing company; PT PLN, a state-owned power generation company; and PT Pertamina, the state oil and gas company.",
            "In 2017, Pertamina, INUKI and PLN completed a preliminary feasibility study on the ThorCon proposal which was positive, and the consortium then sought approval from Indonesia's National Atomic Energy Agency (Batan). Thorcon said that after testing in a full-scale pre-fission test facility, the phase 1 plan is to build a 500MWe ThorConIsle unit (two modules) to prove the design, and then proceed to shipyard construction of further units to provide 3GWe.",
            "In 2019, the state shipbuilding company PT PAL Indonesia, signed an agreement with ThorCon to conduct a development study and build a 500MWe plant. PAL would build the reactor as EPC contractor and put it on a 185-metre-long barge built by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering in Okpo, South Korea. The completed plant would then be towed to a site in Indonesia, ballasted to the seabed and connected to the grid. Thorcon said in a statement it “has expressed seriousness” to invest $1.2 billion to the plant.",
            "The following year, Thorcon and Indonesia’s Defence Ministry signed a MOU to study developing a thorium molten salt reactor for either power generation or marine vehicle propulsion. The head of the Defence Ministry’s Research and Development Agency (DRDA), Dr Anne Kusmayati, said in a statement that thorium-based power R&D in the in DRDA “is in line with the policy of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources which mandates the need for concrete steps to prepare nuclear power development projects, bearing in mind dwindling fossil energy sources and the length of time needed to construct a nuclear power plant”.",
            "The statement added: \"So the thorium-based power development research programme that began in FY 2019 and will last until the Strategic Plan 2020-2024 and may continue represents the Ministry of Defence's efforts to be the initiator or lever in mastering 4th generation nuclear technology that utilises thorium, which is available in abundance in Indonesia.\" Under the strategic plan, the ministry aimed to have an operational molten salt reactor by 2025, which can be used to either generate electricity or power ships and submarines, according to the ministry’s website.",
            "“We hope Thorcon may be more open toward providing technical support for the Defence Ministry’s R&D body in making the designs and technical preparations for when we enter the construction phase,” the ministry’s statement noted. Thorcon said it would provide technical support to DRDA to develop “a small-scale TMSR (thorium molten salt reactor) under 50 MW\", which will “strengthen national security in the outermost, frontier and least developed regions”.",
            "However, Dandang Purwadi, director of National Nuclear Energy Agency (Batan), which had never shown much enthusiasm for the Thorcon project, told The Jakarta Post that thorium nuclear technology is not yet ready for commercial application. “We have to wait around 10 years for the technology to mature, then it takes 10 years to build the facility”, he said.",
            "Undeterred, in January this year, Thorcon named Spanish engineering firm Empresarios Agrupados (EA) as architect engineer for the TMSR-500 to be deployed in Indonesia. As architect engineer, EA will support ThorCon across a broad range of activities, including project management, document control, code compliance, site preparation, pre-construction activities and licensing agreements. Additionally, the company will also provide engineering services to ThorCon throughout the lifecycle of the project, from design engineering to construction, operation and eventual decommissioning.",
            "Six months later, Thorcon reached agreement with the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), which had assumed overall control of all research bodies in Indonesia including Batan. BRIN and ThorCon then agreed to jointly develop and build an experimental NPP based on molten salt reactor technology, with ThorCon stating its readiness to provide full funding privately or without the State Budget for this IDR17,000 billion ($1bn) project, on condition that the Indonesian government would provide support in the form of “legal certainty”.",
            "BRIN Chairman Dr Laksana Tri Handoko noted that ThorCon’s molten salt reactor-based technology “is quite promising in terms of safety, efficiency and from an economic standpoint”. He noted that “this technology is a new generation and no one has yet implemented it,” adding: “However, therein lies our opportunity to be able to jointly develop this technology, so that in the future Indonesia will not only become a user of a nuclear power plant, but also play an active role as a developer.\"",
            "Thorcon’s website notes that its power plant “is encapsulated in a hull, built in a shipyard, towed to a shallow water site, ballasted to the seabed. … [and] requires no new technology. It is “a straightforward scale-up of the successful United States Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). A full-scale 500 MW ThorCon prototype can be operating under test within four years. After proving the plant safely handles multiple potential failures and problems, commercial power plant production can begin.” However, MSRE was shut down in 1969 and is now being prepared for dismantling.",
            "While there is now renewed interest in MSR technology in the US and elsewhere, there are no projects anywhere in the world near realisation – and that includes Thorcon, in spite of its growing list of agreements and MOUs. Moreover, Indonesia appears to be lukewarm about the technology.",
            "Batan has shown more interest in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTRs) than MSRs. In 2014, nuclear co-operation with Japan was extended to research into HTRs and a 2015 agreement with Rusatom Overseas related to small floating plants while a consortium of Russian and Indonesian companies won a contract for the preliminary design of a multi-purpose 10MWt HTR. In 2016 China Nuclear Engineering Corporation also signed a cooperation agreement to develop HTRs. In 2018, Batan launched a roadmap to develop an engineering design for an experimental small pebble-bed HTR and a site licence was received for a 10MWt reactor at Puspiptek.",
            "Meanwhile its interest in conventional nuclear powe is seeing a revival. In June 2022, BRIN said Indonesia’s nuclear energy development plans would need to be supported with the drafting of policies and clear guidelines. \"In the field of nuclear energy, sufficient preparation and support are needed, such as policies, human resources, and facility infrastructure, as well as how to utilise Indonesia's natural resources, which can be used as nuclear fuel,\" BRIN's Development Policy Deputy Mego Pinandito noted. Currently, nuclear power has become a clean energy option for tackling climate change, he added.",
            "On 5 December, Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency (Bapeten) Director for Nuclear Installation and Material Control, Haendra Subekti, said in a statement that, Indonesia is currently looking for investors to help finance a nuclear plant's construction. \"We have drafted regulations on nuclear infrastructure safety, preparing the location for the plant and formulating trial operation. All of these have been nearly completed,\" Subekti noted, adding that the location of the NPP will not be in earthquake-prone areas.",
            "Thorcon’s agreement with BV is the latest in a long-line undertakings in Indonesia that have yet to show any concrete results. The scope of the agreement includes the potential development and deployment phases once the Technology Qualification is completed. At this stage, it is anticipated that the Technology Qualification process will take a minimum of three years and if successful, the deployment phase would require an additional two years. This would bring implementation to 2027. It remains to be seen whether Thorcon’s project figures in any of Indonesia’s new plans.",

        "text": [
            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has accepted an application from X-Energy Reactor Company subsidiary, TRISO-X, for a fuel fabrication facility which will use high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Anticipating the decision, TRISO-X, in October, broke ground and began construction of the facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (TF3) is expected to create more than 400 jobs and attract investment of approximately $300 million. TF3 is set to be commissioned and operational by 2025.",
            "In a letter to TRISO-X, NRC said that the agency had \"determined that the application provides sufficient information to proceed with a detailed technical review\" and further \"established a 30-month review schedule to be completed by June 2025.\"",
            "TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprises three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The coatings have uniform characteristics in all directions. Fuel particles, each the size of a poppy seed, are enriched to a level four times higher than fuel used in most of today’s commercial nuclear reactors. The coatings retain fission products, making each particle its own containment system. DOE says TRISO is “the most robust nuclear fuel on earth”.",
            "In 2020, the DOE selected X-energy for their Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to receive up to $1.2 billion of federal cost-shared funding to develop, license, build, and demonstrate operational advanced reactors by the end of the decade. The TRISO-X nuclear fuel produced in the Oak Ridge TF3 will be used in X-energy’s Xe-100 high-temperature gas reactors, which are expected to be operational by 2028. Since 2016, TRISO-X has operated a pilot-scale nuclear fuel fabrication facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to further develop its TRISO-X fuel and support the Xe-100 reactor design.",
            "“TRISO-X will be the nation’s first commercial scale facility dedicated to fuelling reactors that require high-assay low-enriched uranium TRISO particles,” said Dr Kathryn Huff, Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy earlier this year. “It’s a job creator and an advanced reactor enabler that will help fuel a transition to a net-zero economy.”",
            "However, TRISO fuel development is also continuing at several of the US national laboratories. Earlier in December, BWX Technologies (BWXT) began production of TRISO nuclear fuel intended for the first US microreactor (Project Pele). Under a $37 million award from Idaho National Laboratory (INL), BWXT will manufacture a core for Project Pele, TRISO fuel for additional reactors and coated particle fuel for NASA. The fuel will be down-blended from US government stockpiles of HALEU and fabricated into TRISO fuel at BWXT’s facility in Lynchburg, Virginia. BWXT facilities are the only private US facilities licensed to possess and process highly enriched uranium.",
            "BWXT has expanded its specialty coated fuels production manufacturing capacity through previously announced awards funded by the Department of Defense (DOD) Operational Energy Capabilities Improvement Fund Office and NASA and programme management provided by DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office.",
            "Also in December, US-based Kairos Power signed an agreement to produce TRISO fuel pebbles for the Hermes demonstration reactor at Los Alamos National Laboratory’s (LANL’s) Low Enriched Fuel Fabrication Facility (LEFFF) in New Mexico. The partnership with Los Alamos is facilitated by the Laboratory’s proximity to Kairos Power’s testing and manufacturing facility in Albuquerque.",
            "In August, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) announced the opening of its Pilot Fuel Manufacturing (PFM) facility in Oak Ridge, located in the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP), to produce the first fuel for testing and qualification for use in its Micro Modular Reactor (MMR). The PFM contains full scale production equipment for TRISO particles, and UNSC’s FCM Fuel. The privately owned facility is located on the Manhattan Project site previously occupied by the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. USNC produced its first uranium bearing TRISO particles earlier this year.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under ARDP, including two planned demonstration reactors – Terrapower’s Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors. However, the US is facing problems as domestic production is limited and previous supplies from Russia are no longer available.",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million and DOE has also established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio. However, Centrus Energy Corp is expected to be producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023. Terrapower has postponed its Natrium plans by two years because of the HALEU shortage. It remains to be seen whether the TRISO projects will be affected by this.",

        "text": [
            "US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Environmental Management (EM) crews have begun emplacing defence-related transuranic (TRU) waste in Panel 8 of EM’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico.",
            "Panel 8 consists of seven emplacement rooms, each measuring 33 feet wide, 16 feet high and 300 feet long, the length of a football field minus the end zones. Creating a panel requires mining nearly 160,000 tons of salt. The panel is cut out of a 2,000-foot-thick layer of salt laid down 250 million years ago by the Permian Sea.",
            "WIPP marked a milestone last month when employees finished emplacement in Panel 7 with the last of 20,056 containers. The most common containers, 55-gallon drums, totalled almost 13,000. Emplacement began in Panel 8’s Room 7 with waste containers from Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Panels are filled back to front; it normally takes about 2.5 years to fill a panel.",
            "“We have already seen significant increases in our efficiency as we have emplaced in Panel 8 compared to Panel 7,” said Sean Dunagan, president and project manager of Nuclear Waste Partnership, the WIPP management and operations contractor.",
            "WIPP has been disposing TRU waste since 1999, cleaning up 22 waste generator sites across the DOE complex. TRU waste contains manmade elements heavier than uranium on the periodic table and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris, soil and other items contaminated with small amounts of plutonium and other man-made radioactive elements. The waste is permanently disposed in rooms mined in an underground salt bed layer 2,150 feet below the surface.",
            "Construction of WIPP followed congressional passage of the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act in 1992, which approved emplacement of up to 6.2 million cubic feet of waste. Emplacement in WIPP’s Panel 1 began in 1999.",
            "EM, along with the Environmental Protection Agency EPA and state of Idaho has agreed to expand the Idaho CERCLA Disposal Facility at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Site by creating a new disposal cell adjacent to the existing cell at the centre CERCLA stands for the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.",
            "The INL Site’s largest, active landfill will be expanded to accommodate the disposal of contaminated soil, debris and even reactor vessels for an additional 25 years following approval recently by EM, EPA and Idaho. They have agreed to increase the capacity of the Idaho CERCLA Disposal Facility (ICDF) and construct an additional disposal cell and lined ponds for landfill moisture control nearby ICDF to allow for future waste disposal.",
            "Like the current landfill, the new disposal cell would have strict waste acceptance criteria. The cell will be comparable in design and construction to the existing landfill and will meet applicable state and federal regulations. The ICDF has a disposal capacity of 390,000 cubic metres and has provided onsite waste disposal while providing long-term protection of human health and the environment since its opening in 2003. The facility consolidates waste and radioactively contaminated decontamination and demolition debris from many areas of the 890-square-mile INL site, reducing the footprint into a single, managed and controlled area.",
            "The landfill, located in the southcentral portion of the INL Site, is about 80% full. Without increasing its capacity, it would be full by 2025. EM, EPA and the state authorised a waste disposal increase for the existing cell by 140,000 cubic metres within the same footprint. Once filled, the cell will be covered with a cap designed to prevent water from infiltrating into the disposed waste. They also authorized construction of a new disposal cell with a waste disposal capacity of 530,000 cubic metres The new landfill cell is projected to start receiving waste in 2026 and will be designed to have an operational life of at least 25 years.",

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has docketed Abilene Christian University’s (ACU’s) Nuclear Energy eXperimental Testing Lab construction",
            ", placing it under formal regulatory review. The application is the first for a new research reactor in more than 30 years and the first-ever for an advanced university research reactor. “This is a significant achievement, and I am very proud of the NEXTRA team for producing a quality application, sufficient for NRC docketing,” said Dr Rusty Towell, director of NEXT Lab and professor in the Department of Engineering and Physics.",
            "After receipt of the construction permit application in August, the NRC conducted a thorough acceptance review. The application is now formally docketed, and the NRC will begin a detailed safety and environmental review. ACU’s Molten Salt Research Reactor (MSRR) is the only research reactor currently under review by the NRC, and it is the first and only liquid-fuelled reactor to be reviewed by the NRC. It’s also one of only two advanced nuclear reactor applications currently under review with the NRC.",
            "ACU is the lead university in the NEXT Research Alliance (NEXTRA), which includes Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and The University of Texas at Austin. NEXTRA has a $30.5 million research agreement with Natura Resources to design and build a university-based molten salt research reactor. The consortium was launched in 2019 with the goal to design, license and commission the first university-based molten salt research reactor, which ACU will host and own. Demonstrating the successful licensure of an advanced reactor with the NRC is one of the primary goals of this project. After spending more than two years in pre-licensing activities, the docketing of ACU’s MSRR application marks the beginning of the NRC’s formal technical review.",
            "Construction of the Gayle and Max Dillard Science Engineering Research Centre continues on track for completion in the summer of 2023. The 28,000-square-foot facility will house NEXT Lab and the MSRR, as well as provide dedicated spaces for research in chemistry, physics and engineering.",
            "ACU’s NEXT lab application seeks a license to design, construct, operate, and decommission a fluoride-based, liquid-fuelled MSRR based on molten salt reactor technology developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 1950s and 1960s. In documents filed with NRC, the university describes the 1MWt MSRR as a “single-region, graphite-moderated core, loop-type, thermal spectrum reactor with a fluoride-based fuel salt flowing through 316H stainless steel fuel circuit components”. The cooling loop, which utilises a flowing, fluoride-based salt, will be used to cool the fuel circuit and expel the heat to the atmosphere, it said. The MSRR is also “equipped with an off-gas system that can relocate fission gases from the reactor headspaces through stainless-steel circuit components for sequestration and decay,” it said.",
            "The MSRR will be fuelled with a uranium-bearing, fluoride-based salt “containing minimal oxidative impurities”, ACU said. “The baseline fuel composition is LiF-BeF2-UF4 in a molar ratio of approximately 67:28:5”. The enrichment of U-235 will be approximately 19.75%, while the enrichment of lithium in Li7 will be about 99.99% or more.",
            "MSRR salts are highly ionic, chemically stable compounds that are immune to radiolysis, the university noted. While that chemical inertness eliminates the risk of fire or explosion, molten salts offer a suitable medium for heat transfer. “The MSRR salts are stable to several hundred degrees above temperatures obtainable in the reactor and remain at low vapor pressure,” it said. “The melting point of the fuel salt is about 500C (932F), and the melting point of the coolant salt is about 460C (890F). The MSRR’s large negative temperature coefficient and reactivity that passively moderates heat production also allows for a “significant” load-following capability, ACU noted.",
            "The university in July contracted Teledyne Brown, a nuclear component and system design and fabrication firm, to perform front-end engineering and design work for the facility. The contract is part of the $30.5 million sponsored research agreement (SRA) with Natura Resources, a for-profit entity designed to be the funding instrument for the research, in collaboration with the NEXT Research Alliance. ACU said the NEXT lab formally took shape in 2016 after garnering interest from a group of university benefactors and entrepreneurs. In 2018, the Department of Energy (DOE), then headed by former Texas governor Rick Perry, expressed interest in the project. In 2019 became part of the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy’s (NE’s) Research Reactor Infrastructure programme, which allows the DOE to provide fuel cycle services for the MSRR without cost, as the DOE does for other university research reactors.",
            "ACU said the construction permit application is one of eight primary milestones on the way the MSRR’s operation. “The first milestone was completed in 2021 when the Science and Engineering Research Centre design was completed and its completion in 2023 will mark another milestone. “Formal interactions with the NRC make up half of the milestones with the submission and approval of both the construction permit and, later, the operation licence. The final two milestones are the construction of the reactor and its operation.",

            "Demolition has begun on the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Bulk Shielding Reactor Complex (BSRC). US Department of Energy (DOE) Environmental Management (EM) crews began demolishing a former reactor facility, reaching another important milestone for clean-up at the site.",
            "EM Oak Ridge clean-up contractor UCOR began tearing down the Bulk Shielding Reactor, also known as Building 3010. “While this project is not the biggest demolition we’ve undertaken, it carries a lot of significance,” said Laura Wilkerson, acting manager for the Oak Ridge Office of EM. “It is the first removal of a former reactor at ORNL, and it is a signal of much more to come at the site in the immediate future.”",
            "BSRC was built in the 1950s for radiation shielding studies as part of the federal Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Programme. It included a 27-foot-deep reactor pool filled with water to shield the radioactive components contained in the pool. Its mission changed to a general-purpose research reactor in 1963 and was shut down permanently in 1991.",
            "“A great deal of prep work was necessary to ensure this facility could be demolished safely,” said Dan Macias, UCOR site integration and clean-up manager. “As with all clean-up work we do, safety is the top priority, and crews have been working diligently during the past few years to eliminate hazards and ensure successful demolition of the reactor facility.”",
            "One of the most important pre-demolition activities was removing and disposing of irradiated components from the reactor pool. Once those components were removed, workers drained the 130,000 gallons of the water from the pool and sent it to an onsite treatment facility. Then the pool area was decontaminated and filled with a concrete mixture. In addition to stabilising the reactor pool, workers removed various wastes as well as asbestos from the facility.",
            "The reactor was one of more than a dozen research reactors constructed at ORNL over multiple decades. Each contributed to ORNL’s reputation as a world leader in cutting-edge nuclear research and development. The facility is one of 16 inactive research reactors and isotope facilities EM is addressing at ORNL.",
            "“UCOR is proud to be part of another significant clean-up milestone on the Oak Ridge Reservation,” said Ken Rueter, UCOR president and CEO. “From completing the first-ever clean-up of a gaseous diffusion plant to this notable milestone, the landscape at the Oak Ridge Reservation is changing dramatically, providing essential land for continuing federal missions and economic development. We look forward to continuing clean-up progress at ORNL and across the reservation.”",
            "Crews will complete demolition on the facility this year before moving on to demolish the nearby Low Intensity Test Reactor, known as Building 3005.",

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has released a 127-page report, “",
            "Investigating Benefits and Challenges of Converting Retiring Coal Plants into Nuclear Plants",
            "”, identifying 157 retired coal plant sites and 237 operating coal plant sites as potential candidates for a coal-to-nuclear (C2N) transition. The study, conducted by Argonne National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, sponsored by DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, said 80% of the identified plants were good candidates to host advanced small reactors.",
            "According to the study, C2N could add a substantial amount of clean electricity to the grid, helping to achieve net-zero emissions goals by 2050. Greenhouse gas emissions in a region could fall by 86% by replacing coal plants with NPPs. In addition, jobs in the region could increase by more than 650 permanent positions Long-term job impacts could lead to additional annual economic activity of $275 million, implying an increase of 92% tax revenue for the local county compared with a coal powered plant.",
            "The reuse of coal infrastructure for advanced nuclear reactors could also reduce costs for developing new nuclear technology, saving 15-35% in construction costs. C2N transitions could save millions of dollars by reusing the coal plant’s electrical equipment (transmission lines, switchyards), cooling ponds or towers, and civil infrastructure such as roads and office buildings.",
            "Based on the results of the study “at least four key, high-level conclusions can be drawn”:",
            "Economic potential exists for owners of coal-powered plants (CPPs) and communities where such plants are located. “The results reported here imply cost savings from repurposing coal infrastructure. Given this finding, coupled with the reality that 32% of operating CPP sites have announced retirement dates … economic potential exists for the remaining 68% of CPP sites.” The second takeaway is that C2N transitions “may be an economic boost for disadvantaged communities”.",
            "Opportunities likely exist for first-mover projects. The study results “suggest economic potential for communities and firms that pursue C2N transitions”. There is “a potential advantage for interested coal communities to be first movers in what could be a series of many C2N transitions across the United States”. Early adopter communities can “get ahead” of the transition by working with utility management to update integrated resource plans with a focus on C2N transitions. “This may be especially important for a utility ownership that does not currently have nuclear as part of their energy generation portfolio. The utility stands to save on capital costs from repurposed infrastructure, and the community stands to mitigate negative outcomes from shutdown of the local power plant.”",
            "Extensions of this analysis. A limitation of the study is it does not evaluate impacts to the coal mining sector and other upstream supply-chain issues. Recogniding that constructing NPPs creates emissions is also not reflected in this study. “This leaves open the opportunity in a broader, supply-chain analysis to evaluate this impact.” The study also does not consider transitioning other energy assets to clean energy, such as retired steel facilities or petro-chemical plants. “A logical extension is to expand the analysis to consider broader supply-chain implications.”",
            "This is a study with general-level findings which are informative for case-specific applications. The findings can be used to compare alternative nuclear designs with plant specific characteristics at a CPP. Results of such an approach could then be used to refine the extent of cost savings. The economic impact results suggest that many of the job functions at a CPP match up with the job functions at an NPP. Some do not. These results could be used to refine the types of job transition programmes that a community or utility may want to consider in implementing a C2N transition. “Further, the economic impact study evaluated options for nuclear capacity that in some cases would generate more megawatt hours than the replaced coal capacity. This suggests that case-specific applications could investigate the potential for expanded market opportunity from nuclear capacity.”",
            "“This is an important opportunity to help communities around the country preserve jobs, increase tax revenue, and improve air quality,” said Assistant Secretary for Nuclear Energy Dr Kathryn Huff. “As we move to a clean energy future, we need to deliver place-based solutions and ensure an equitable energy transition that does not leave communities behind.”",

The project began in 2011, when CAS launched an R&D programme for liquid-salt thorium reactors. It is variously referred to as a liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR), a thorium-breeding molten-salt reactor (TMSR), or fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor (FHR).",
            "The R&D budget for its development totalled CNY3 billion ($450m). The TMSR centre at SINAP, located in the Jiading district of Shanghai, was assigned responsibility for the work. Construction began in September 2018 at a branch of the institute in the city of Wuwe in the Gobi Deser, in the Chinese province of Gansu. Initially, the completion date was 2024, but subsequently a decision was made to accelerate work, and completion of the reactor was announced in September 2021.",
            "On 2 August, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment sent a directive to SINAP as follows: “According to the relevant provisions of the Nuclear Safety Law of the People's Republic of China and the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Safety Supervision and Management of Civilian Nuclear Installations, our bureau has carried out a technical review of the documents submitted by you, and considers that your plan for commissioning the 2MWt experimental liquid fuel reactor fuel based on thorium and molten salt (version V1.3) is acceptable and approved.”",

If the pilot operation of the TMSR-LF1 reactor proves successful, China plans to build a larger 373MWe reactor of this type by 2030.",
            "The project is expected to start on a batch basis with some online refuelling and removal of gaseous fission products, but discharging all fuel salt after 5-8 years for reprocessing and separation of fission products and minor actinides for storage. It will proceed to a continuous process of recycling salt, uranium and thorium, with online separation of fission products and minor actinides. The reactor will work up from about 20% thorium fission to about 80%.",

            "Their proposal centres on a comprehensive systems approach to significantly reduce the waste burden by improving fuel utilization and reducing uranium loading. This approach considers the use of a TRISO-based micro-encapsulated fuel employing MgO as a low-waste and repository-ready fuel form. MATRICY will engineer the TRISO fuel to enable deconsolidation of intact particles. At the same time the project will evaluate it as a final waste form for long-term disposition.",
            "The Stony Brook team will couple reactor analysis with a programme to fabricate and understand the performance of the new fuel and its waste forms. They aim to realise more than an order of magnitude reduction in nuclear waste compared with current state-of-the-art technologies.",
            "Meanwhile, the University of California, Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and NAC International are working in partnership with Deep Isolation on the UPWARDS programme with more than US$3.6 million of ARPA-E funding. The Universal Performance Criteria and Canister for Advanced Reactor Waste Form Acceptance in Borehole and Mined Repositories Considering Design Safety (UPWARDS) project is looking to establish a novel universal canister system for advanced reactor waste streams. This new canister will create an elemental waste form that will decouple the interdependent constraints that exist between storage, transport, and disposal, the partners state. Designed to be compatible with current dry storage and transportation infrastructure, the new canister will also meet the thermal, volumetric and criticality waste acceptance constraints of Deep Isolation’s deep borehole solution. The goal is to minimise the long-term costs of used fuel and waste management by packaging waste in small canisters that can be dry stored on site or centrally, transported to a geologic repository, and disposed of without repackaging.",
            "Deep Isolation is also partnering with another group receiving ARPA-E funding. In an Oklo-led project – Enabling the Near-term Commercialization of an Electrorefining Facility to Close the Metal Fuel Cycle – the partners aim to commercialise a nuclear fuel recycling facility within the next few years. This facility will produce fuel for Oklo’s metal-fuelled reactors and close the advanced reactor fuel cycle. ARPA-E funding worth US$4 million will allow the partners to focus on industrialising and automating the key processes of an electrorefining facility used for recycling nuclear fuel. That will address each key operation and demonstrate the end-to-end process with simulated fuel. The project will also prepare the facility",
            "for NRC licensing and establish a plan for the final deep borehole repository disposal of any waste resulting from the process. This technology is expected to reduce waste by more than an order of magnitude compared with a no-reprocessing baseline. In addition, ONWARDS aims to advance development of high-performance waste forms while maintaining back-end costs in the accepted range of US$1/MWh, its backers claim.",
            "“The ONWARDS project will build on our other DOE project work to allow Oklo to build a first-of-a-kind fuel recycling facility,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo. “A commercial-scale fuel recycling facility will change the economic paradigm for advanced fission,” he added.",
            "Smaller projects are also underway at Brigham Young University – Two-Step Chloride Volatility Process for Reprocessing Used Nuclear Fuel from Advanced Reactors; Idaho National Laboratory – Traveling Molten Zone Refining Process Development for Innovative Fuel Cycle Solutions; and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute – Metal-Halide Perovskites as Innovative and Cost-Effective Fluoride Salt Waste Forms. These projects round out the 11 which are receiving funding under this round of ARPA-E funding.",
            "All these research projects seek to increase the deployment and use of nuclear power as a reliable source of clean energy by limiting the volume of waste produced from Advanced Reactors. By mitigating waste and storage concerns, the goal is to support clean energy infrastructure and pave the way for a new era of nuclear energy. Indeed, the DOE recently released a supply chain report noting that the development of fuel and an integrated waste disposal strategy for advanced reactor technologies are significant factors in supporting further nuclear energy deployment. As Secretary of Energy Jennifer M Granholm says: “Developing novel approaches to safely manage nuclear waste will enable us to power even more homes and businesses in America with carbon-free nuclear energy. ARPA-E is doing just that by supporting companies",
            "and universities that are working on next-generation technologies to modernise advanced reactors and strengthen the nation’s clean energy enterprise”."

            "Above: Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s Fully Ceramic Microencapsulated fuel",
            "Designing, licensing, building and deploying Gen IV nuclear reactors is proceeding steadily. The growing momentum behind new nuclear is in response to the need to eliminate carbon emissions, while delivering a stable and reliable power supply. Almost weekly there are technical advances, energy-generation agreements and interest announced in various Gen IV reactor designs by countries and organisations around the globe.",
            "When the marketplace evaluates next-generation nuclear options, whether it be small modular reactors (SMRs) or microreactors, often the focus is on the plant hardware. The reactor, and the adjacent equipment that puts nuclear-generated energy to productive use, are certainly important, but it is only half of the equation. The fuel that will power these reactors is just as crucial.",
            "Fuel design is progressing and is benefiting from new approaches and modern technologies. However, it is critical to have a tangible, dependable supply chain for these advanced fuels if new nuclear is to be successful.",
            "Enhancing fuel performance and safety",
            "The most common fuel form in Gen IV designs is the tristructural isotropic (TRISO) fuel particle. The high-temperature radionuclide retention capability of TRISO fuel particles has been studied, improved and established over recent decades. TRISO has long been relied on because it can be manufactured efficiently with consistent performance characteristics. Combined with the passive heat removal systems of Gen IV reactors, TRISO is the foundational technology for many SMR and microreactor systems.",
            "At Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC), we are building on the proven safety and irradiation performance of TRISO fuel with Fully Ceramic Microencapsulated (FCM®) fuel.",
            "By embedding individual TRISO fuel particles inside a refractory silicon carbide (SiC) ceramic, we increase safety without reducing performance.",
            "As a technical ceramic with extreme environmental stability even in high-temperature applications, the SiC matrix in FCM fuel is an advance over the historic graphitic-matrix fuel and ideal for use in Gen IV reactors.",
            "Graphitic-matrix fuel exhibits complex irradiation behaviours — initially shrinking, then expanding — so the material degrades over time. The graphitic matrix is also prone to oxidation, making it susceptible to degradation in the presence of trace amounts of air or moisture that could leak into reactor coolant.",
            "In contrast, the silicon carbide matrix in FCM exhibits well known and finite swelling behaviour and can withstand an extremely high radiation dose, while retaining its configuration and strength. Silicon carbide also has exceptional air and steam oxidation resistance and is extremely resistant to environmental degradation.",
            "The radionuclide retention behaviour of SiC is the most important consideration. A silicon carbide coat is the primary barrier to radionuclide release in the TRISO spherical fuel particle. The radionuclide retention of TRISO fuel is dramatically improved in FCM fuel by embedding the TRISO particle inside the SiC matrix, which serves as an additional strong radionuclide release barrier.",
            "The inherent accident tolerance of silicon carbide and very low radionuclide release rates from the fuel are strong safety benefits.",
            "Deploying fuel manufacturing facilities",
            "USNC has recently opened two facilities in the USA to manufacture its core materials and FCM fuel. These facilities have been financed exclusively through USNC’s private capital, a testament to the company’s strong commitment to delivering a tangible and reliable fuel supply chain.",
            "The first of these two facilities — Advanced Ceramics Manufacturing (ACM) — is a non-radiological manufacturing unit in Salt Lake City, Utah. The ACM facility entered operation in 2021 and is dedicated to manufacturing non-radiological ceramic components for USNC’s microreactors.",
            "Many of the manufacturing technologies at ACM are underpinned by USNC’s proprietary ceramic additive manufacturing technology (a combination of binderjet additive manufacturing and chemical vapour infiltration), developed by some of USNC’s staff previously working at US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). USNC licensed this technology to apply it to the manufacturing of its FCM fuel and non-fuel advanced ceramic components.",
            "The ACM facility hosts most of USNC’s current binderjet additive manufacturing and chemical vapour infiltration systems. These systems offer a wide range of manufacturing capacity from 0.5l to 150l of production volume. These capabilities are applied to production of SiC, zirconium carbide (ZrC) and various metal hydrides.",
            "The manufacturing capability for these speciality ceramics supports deployment of USNC’s Micro Modular Reactor MMR® as well as its space-related nuclear energy systems.",
            "The second facility is the Pilot Fuel Manufacturing (PFM) plant, located on an 8.7 acre site in the East Tennessee Technology Park (ETTP) — originally the location of the Manhattan Project’s K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. PFM is a radiological manufacturing unit dedicated to pilot-scale manufacturing of TRISO fuel particles and FCM fuel. It is due to enter operation in mid 2022 and its production-scale fuel manufacturing modules will process feedstock uranium into TRISO fuel particles and subsequently produce FCM fuel in multiple kilogramme quantities. The PFM facility is a serial manufacturing process:",

            "One of the aims of the PFM facility is to fully establish and codify the production-scale modules for manufacturing TRISO and FCM fuel to support deployment of the modules in USNC’s future commercial-scale nuclear fuel manufacturing facilities. It will enable an informed and efficient licensing process for those facilities.",
            "The PFM facility siting involved due diligence to ensure the location uses the best available workforce and regional synergies. PFM is close to ORNL and the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration’s Y-12 National Security Complex, and this will enhance PFM facility operations by allowing access to world-class fuel characterisation and uranium logistics capabilities, respectively.",
            "TRISO and FCM fuel manufacturing processes differ vastly from those used for light water reactor fuel manufacturing, using materials, chemicals and processes with unique requirements. Developing and executing a sensible licensing strategy entails additional effort and early interaction with regulators.",
            "Fortunately, these regulatory bodies recognise they have to work effectively with advanced reactor developers to assure the highest levels of public safety and enable the industrial base to transition from light water reactors to the new nuclear fleet.",
            "USNC’s application of additive techniques to manufacture the SiC matrix of the FCM fuel form permits fuel designs to be geometrically optimised with unique tracking and monitoring capabilities, improving system safety and performance.",

            "USNC believes that as the fuel supply chain evolves, FCM architecture based on coated particle fuels will be used in the USNC MMR as well as in other SMRs and microreactors.",
            "A near-term objective of USNC’s PFM facility is to produce a batch of TRISO and FCM fuel for its qualification programme in support of MMR licensing. This qualification fuel batch is slated for irradiation testing in 2023 in the Petten reactor in the Netherlands. The results will be integral to qualifying FCM fuel for use in MMRs and other advanced reactors.",
            "Low enriched uranium (LEU) with enrichment greater than 5wt% is key to Gen IV reactor fuels. The need for this stream of HALEU remains conspicuous and requires coordinated action by governmental and non-governmental organisations. They are working to establish this feedstock availability.
