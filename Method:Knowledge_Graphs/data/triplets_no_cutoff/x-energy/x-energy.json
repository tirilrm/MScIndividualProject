            "‘Massive step forward’ for building supply chain to advance next generation of nuclear reactors",
            "US-based advanced reactor developer X-energy has been awarded a $148.5m (€138.8m) tax credit for the construction by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Triso-X, of a first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ",
            "Funded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the award is part of a programme jointly administered by the US Department of Energy, the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service.",
            "X-energy chief executive officer J. Clay Sell said the award is a massive step forward for building the supply chain to advance the next generation of nuclear energy. ",
            "“Strengthening energy security here and around the world requires expanding secure, domestic manufacturing capabilities across the energy sector,” he said, adding that the tax credit would create opportunities to enable the delivery of Triso-X fuel on a commercial scale.",
            "The fuel fabrication facility, known as TX-1, is designed to produce up to 714,000 “pebbles” of Triso-X (tri-structural isotropic) particle fuel a year along with other nuclear fuel products. ",
            "At the heart of each Triso-X fuel particle is a kernel of uranium oxide and carbide. The kernel is surrounded by four barrier layers that act in concert to stabilise and contain the uranium kernel.  Each pebble houses tens of thousands of Triso-X particles.",
            "Triso-X particle fuel is considered “the most robust nuclear fuel on the planet,” according to the DOE, because it can withstand very high temperatures without melting, which is key to its safety. Triso-X manufactures its own proprietary version of Triso fuel to ensure supply, improve quality and reduce costs. ",
            "Triso-X has operated a pilot nuclear fuel fabrication facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory since 2016, serving as a demonstration facility of the company’s patented Triso fabrication processes.",
            "X-energy and US chemicals company Dow have chosen Dow’s UCC Seadrift Operations manufacturing site in Texas for the deployment of an X-energy Xe-100 advanced small modular reactor.",
            "It is expected to be the first grid-scale advanced nuclear reactor deployed to serve an industrial site in North America. ",
            "The Xe-100 is a Generation IV high-temperature gas-cooled reactor unit. Each reactor is engineered to operate as a single 80 MW unit and can be optimised as a four-unit plant delivering 320 MW. It can provide baseload power to an electricity system or support industrial applications with 200 MW thermal output per unit of high pressure, high temperature steam.",

            " Countries in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects will be likely to “double down their scrutiny” of small modular reactor offers following the cancellation of NuScale’s agreement with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (Uamps) for a Voygr SMR project in Idaho.",
            "Writing in his Neutron Bytes blog, nuclear energy analyst Dan Yurman said the lack of cost competitiveness of the NuScale Uamps project will have implications for US-based NuScale’s export opportunities for its Voygr technology in Romania, Poland, and Indonesia. ",
            "All three countries are price sensitive and are likely to closely assess offerings from NuScale and for every other developer of SMRs, for both light-water reactor and advanced designs, seeking export sales, Yurman wrote.",
            "“Other countries, like Estonia and the Philippines, which are in the preliminary stages of planning nuclear power projects, will also likely be doubling down their scrutiny of SMR offers. ",
            "“The key competition in all of these countries will come from the price of natural gas used to generate electricity and time to deliver a gas plant v. building an SMR.”",
            "Yurman said the Uamps project was heavily subsidised by the US government in the form of $1.35bn (€1.24bn) in cash to make the first-of-a-kind new build affordable. ",
            "“However, until global inflationary pressures abate, no commercial customer in the Philippines, Poland, or anywhere else is likely to commit to multi-billion-dollar capital expenditures for multiple SMRs without the host domestic government providing financial and rate guarantees for the project,” the blog said.",
            "He said unless the US commits to major levels of export financing for SMRs, like the levels of commitment South Korea and Japan have shown over the years for full size reactors, all US SMR developers will be at a financial disadvantage to Russia and China when they eventually bring their SMRs to market. ",
            "“NuScale’s business decisions that led to the Uamps contract contain a number of missteps that can be avoided in future deals,” Yurman said.",
            "“NuScale should have sought as its first customer a utility with an operating nuclear reactor that would have a management team with the know-how to handle a new nuclear project.",
            "This “onsite strategy” would accrue significant cost savings with a switchyard and grid connection in place with a well-defined service area facing growing demand for power. Local and regional transportation networks, including rail, would have been available. Recruitment of skilled trades to build the plant and access to supply chains would be easier.",
            "Several other SMR developers are mindful of this issue. GE-Hitachi has plans to build multiple units of its BWRX-300 SMR at TVA’s Clinch River site in Tennessee and at OPG’s Darlington nuclear site in Canada. X-Energy announced its first advanced small modular reactor site near the Columbia nuclear power station in Washington state.",
            "NuScale, the first company with US approval for an SMR design, cancelled the Uamps project in November 2023. A statement at the time said it was unlikely the project would have enough subscription from power purchasers to continue towards deployment.",

Most recently, US nuclear plant developer NuScale Power and Romania’s RoPower signed a contract\r\nfor front-end engineering and design (Feed) work, marking a significant step towards the deployment of a NuScale Voygr small modular reactor power plant in Romania. The UK is looking at its first SMR by the early years of the next decade. The potentially game-changing technology is under consideration as far afield as Canada, the Philippines, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In the US, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) announced its intent to issue a final rule to certify NuScale Power’s SMR. Once published, companies can soon start referencing the SMR design in their combined licensing applications. Tennessee Valley Authority announced an agreement with GE-Hitachi to support planning and preliminary licensing efforts for the potential deployment of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Clinch River site. Other big announcements included Dow and X-energy agreeing to deploy an Xe-100 SMR at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites by 2030 as well as TerraPower and PacifiCorp exploring the possibility of building five additional Natrium reactors in the PacifiCorp service area by 2035.\n\n",

            "Investigating Benefits and Challenges of Converting Retiring Coal Plants into Nuclear Plants",
            "found. The USA's current nuclear fleet has a combined capacity of 95 GWe.",
            "The report is underpinned by a study carried out by the Argonne, Idaho and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, sponsored by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy. It is guided by three overarching questions: where in the USA are retired coal facilities located and what factors make a site feasible for transition; what factors of technology, cost, and project timeline drive investor economics over such a decision; and how will C2N impact local communities?",
            "The team screened recently retired and active coal plant sites to identify 157 retired and 237 operating coal plants sites as potential candidates for a C2N transition, which it further evaluated on parameters including population density, distance from seismic fault lines, flooding potential, and nearby wetlands, to determine if they could safely host a nuclear power plant. It found that 80% of the potential sites are suitable for hosting advanced nuclear power plants of varying size and type, depending on the size of the site being converted.",
            "The team then evaluated a case study of detailed impacts and potential outcomes from a C2N transition at a hypothetical site, considering various nuclear technology types for a range of scenarios including large light-water reactors, small modular reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors and very high temperature reactors.",
            "At the regional level, replacing a large coal plant site with a nuclear power plant of equivalent size could provide some 650 jobs and USD275 million of economic activity, the report found. These jobs are spread across the plant, the supply chain supporting the plant, and the community surrounding the plant and most typically come with wages that are about 25% higher than any other energy technology. Nuclear power plant projects could also benefit from preserving the existing experienced workforce in communities around retiring coal plant sites, which already possess the necessary skills and knowledge that could be tranistioned to work at a nuclear power plant.",
            "Reusing existing coal infrastructure for new advanced nuclear reactors can lead to construction cost savings of 15-35%, the report found. Using existing land, grid connections, office buildings, electrical equipment such as transmission connections and switchyards, and civil infrastructure could also save millions of dollars upfront.",
            "Economic potential exists for owners of coal power plants - and the communities where they are located - from a C2N transition, the report concludes, with a potential further advantage for interested coal communities to be \"first movers\" in what the authors say could be a series of many C2N transitions across the USA. Although the study's findings inform only at a general level, the results could be used to set up more detailed, in-depth analyses to allow more accurate evaluations specific to a particular coal plant or nuclear technology design.",

TerraPower in 2021 announced plans to build a demonstration unit of its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor at a retired coal plant site in Wyoming; earlier this year, the the Maryland Energy Administration announced its support for work to evaluate the possibility of repurposing a coal-fired electric generating facility with X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor; and Holtec International recently said it is considering coal plant sites as possible locations for its SMR-160 with plans to bring the first unit online as early as 2029.

        "title": "IEEFA report critiques feasibility of small modular reactors",
        "text": [
            "A new report by the Institute for Energy Economics & Financial Analysis (IEEFA) has assessed the feasibility of deploying small modular nuclear reactors to meet increasing energy demands around the world. The report, “Small Modular Reactors: Still Too Expensive, Too Slow, and Too Risky” asks if continuing to pursue small NPPs is worthwhile in terms of meeting increasing global energy demands. demand for more energy around the globe.",
            "The 23-page report notes: “The rhetoric from small modular reactor (SMR) advocates is loud and persistent: This time will be different because the cost overruns and schedule delays that have plagued large reactor construction projects will not be repeated with the new designs,” says the report. “But the few SMRs that have been built (or have been started) paint a different picture – one that looks startlingly similar to the past. Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "On costs, the report looks at three operating SMRs worldwide—two in Russia [possibly just one – the Akademik Lomonosov, which has two reactors] and one in China, the demonstration High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor-Pebble-bed Module (HTR-PM) at the Shidaowan site in Shandong province. It also considers a fourth – the CAREM-25 SMR under construction in Argentina.",
            "It says costs for all four [three] have been significantly higher than originally planned. “The takeaway is that the projected costs significantly understated actual construction expenditures.” However, the report does not take into account that these are all first-of-a-kind (FOAK) designs and have become the basis of further plants. Russia is already building several SMRs (both floating and land based) in almost series production using upgraded reactors based on the Akademik Lomosonov experience, the costs of which will be greatly reduced. China’s HTR-PM has become the basis for a novel district heating scheme and a larger HTGR is now being developed based on this experience. The CAREM 25 has faced delays and cost overruns but is now expected to begin operation in 2027. Both Russia and Argentina expect their designs to be the basis for lucrative exports in the future.",
            "IEEFA says two other SMRs currently under construction in China and Russia are also years behind schedule. “Russia’s BREST-300 lead-cooled reactor is now scheduled for completion in 2026, even though announcements in the early 2010s had indicated it would be operational by 2018. Similarly, China’s ACP100, a 125MW pressurized water SMR that has been under development since the early 2010s, is now not scheduled to begin commercial operation until 2026.” These are also FOAK designs for which delays are par for the course and will ultimately offer opportunities for replication and exports.",
            "IEEFA notes that similar significant cost increases have occurred at proposed projects in the US, citing the cancellation of NuScale’s planned facility in Idaho in cooperation with the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "The report notes: “NuScale’s problems are not unique. US SMR developers have consistently sought to shield their construction cost estimates, but information about two other prominent projects shows that the estimated costs for these projects also have skyrocketed. The cost increases for the X-Energy and GE-Hitachi SMR projects occurred well before either had secured licensing approval from NRC [National Regulatory Authority], let alone begun construction. IEEFA believes this should be a red flag for utilities, regulators and investors.",
            "IEEFA says the cost debate “inevitably includes Westinghouse, the developer of the two AP1000 reactors recently brought online at Georgia Power’s Vogtle nuclear facility”, which was more than $20bn over budget and took more than six years longer to complete than forecast. “Undaunted by that debacle, Westinghouse has now jumped into the SMR market, introducing a 300MW unit (the AP300) that it says it can build for $3,333 per kW- even though the final cost of the Vogtle reactors was more than $20,000 per kW in 2023-year dollars. Even if Westinghouse’s projected AP300 cost is just an overnight estimate that excludes escalation and financing costs, that is a spectacular projected cost reduction for a facility that is still not licensed and far from breaking ground for construction.”",
            "In terms of the projects being “too slow”, the report, referring to the same projects, notes that they all took longer to build than planned. Again, with respect to the Russian and Chinese plants, this was not a real consideration as it is expected for FOAK projects.",
            "However, for those still in the design stage, IEEFA may have a point. “Despite this real-world experience, Westinghouse, X-Energy and NuScale, among others, continue to claim they will be able to construct their SMRs in 36 to 48 months, perhaps quickly enough to have them online by 2030,” the report notes. “GE-Hitachi even claims it ultimately will be able to construct its 300MW facility in as little as 24 months. Admittedly, there is a not-zero chance this is possible, but it flies in the face of nuclear industry experience, both in terms of past SMR development and construction efforts and the larger universe of full-size reactors, all of which have taken significantly longer than projected to begin commercial operation.”",
            "As to the projects being “too risky”, IEEFA simply says the cost increases and construction delays that have plagued the SMR sector already “will push enormous financial and time risks onto",
            "customers, potentially undercutting their interest and ability in pursuing such projects. Aware of these risk-related problems, the Department of Energy has floated several ideas to get the government involved in the buildout of the SMR sector. These include providing “cost overrun insurance,” other undefined financial assistance, becoming an owner or serving as a buyer for the power. None of these options would reduce the development risk—they would simply transfer those risks and the associated costs to US taxpayers",
            "In conclusion, IEEFA says it released its first analysis of the SMR sector more than two years ago, “concluding that the much-hyped resource would be too slow, too expensive and too risky to help in the transition away from fossil fuels”. It added: “We stand by that conclusion.”",
            "The report notes: “Perhaps most concerning is the risk factor, especially when compared to the known costs and construction timelines for readily available wind, solar and battery storage resources. … At least 375,000 MW of new renewable energy generating capacity is likely to be added to the US grid in the next seven years. By contrast, IEEFA believes it is highly unlikely any SMRs will be brought online in that same time frame. The comparison couldn’t be clearer. Regulators, utilities, investors and government officials should acknowledge this and embrace the available reality: Renewables are the near-term solution.”",
            "The report makes several recommendations:",
            "Regulators who will be asked to approve utility or developer-backed SMR proposals should craft restrictions to prevent delays and cost increases from being pushed onto ratepayers.",
            "Utilities that are considering SMRs should be required to compare the technology’s uncertain costs and completion dates with the known costs and construction timetables of renewable alternatives. Utilities that still opt for the SMR option should be required to put shareholder funds at risk if costs and construction times exceed utility estimates.",
            "Investors and bankers weighing any SMR proposal should carefully conduct their due diligence. Things will go wrong, imperiling the chances for full recovery of any invested funds.",
            "State and federal governments should require that estimated SMR construction costs and schedules be publicly available so that utility ratepayers, taxpayers and investors are better able to assess the magnitude of the SMR-related financial risks that they may be forced to bear.",
            "Finally, it is vital that this debate consider the opportunity costs associated with the SMR push. The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years—years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.",
            "IEEFA says its mission “is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy”. It adds that its market-based research “shows how the rise of the new energy economy, where renewable energy sources are steadily eroding reliance on fossil fuels, makes financial sense for investors, governments, businesses, communities and ratepayers”.",
            "In line with this mission, the new report says: “The dollars invested in SMRs will not be available for use in building out a wind, solar and battery storage resource base. These carbon-free and lower-cost technologies are available today and can push the transition from fossil fuels forward significantly in the coming 10 years – years when SMRs will still be looking for licensing approval and construction funding.”"

            "X-energy UK Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of US-based X-energy Reactor Company, and Cavendish Nuclear, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Babcock International have commissioned the UK’s Teesside University to study the potential regional economic benefits of a multi-billion pound NPP project in Hartlepool. The assessment of the socio-economic opportunities will include jobs, skills, supply chain contracts, and investment. Project leader will be Teesside University’s Professor of Public Policy Matthew Cotton.",
            "Professor Cotton has published works relating to new technologies, policies and practices in the fields of energy, climate change, waste management and public health. “A core principle of our research is to work with communities to address regional disparities and drive social impact for regions across the world,” he said. “The proposed nuclear power plant at Hartlepool represents a massive capital investment in the Tees Valley and it is vital to understand what that impact will look like.",
            "He added: “By analysing how a project of this scope and scale will manifest itself, we will be able to determine the different socio-economic considerations, issues and risk factors for Hartlepool and surrounding regions. In doing so, we will be able to determine the best course of action in order to take full advantage of the benefits and mitigate any impacts for the region.”",
            "The work is part of a £6.68m ($8.5m) programme funded by X-energy, and by the UK Government which awarded the firms £3.34m in April from the Department of Energy Security & Net Zero’s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund. X-energy is proposing to build its Xe-100 advanced modular reactor plant by the early 2030s, next to Hartlepool’s existing NPP which is scheduled to close by 2026.",
            "X-energy and Cavendish in 2023 identified Hartlepool as a preferred location for construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the UK. The companies applied to the Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to support a Generic Design Assessment of the Xe-100 SMR and supply chain development activities for the first project.",
            "The Xe-100 is a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor with a thermal output of 200 MWt or an electrical output of 80 MWe. It can be scaled into a four-pack 320 MWe power plant, fuelled by the company’s proprietary TRISO-X tri-structural isotropic particle fuel. The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa. X-energy was selected by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 to receive up to $1.2bn in matching funds under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to develop, license, build, and demonstrate an operational advanced reactor and fuel fabrication facility by the end of the decade. X-Energy has since completed the reactor engineering and basic design and is developing a fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge in Tennessee.",
            "Early estimates indicate a 12-reactor multi-billion-pound X-energy project at Hartlepool would directly employ hundreds of people during operation with a peak construction workforce of several thousand. UK Minister for Nuclear & Renewables, Andrew Bowie, said: “New nuclear projects could provide jobs and investment for local communities across the UK, and we look forward to seeing the benefits of a potential new nuclear plant in Hartlepool.”",
            "X-energy’s Vice President of Projects and UK market leader Carol Tansley said the NPP project represents a “fantastic economic and employment opportunity” and will contribute to energy security and decarbonisation. “We want to understand from the outset how best to help our potential host community and the surrounding area capitalise on the benefits it will bring. “Teesside University is ideally placed to help us. The team has huge experience of similar exercises in the past, and excellent links with the local community and business sector.”",
            "According to Mick Gornall, Managing Director of Cavendish Nuclear a regional economy which hosts such a project can experience a rise in productivity and growth. “Creating supply chains and other infrastructure in local and neighbouring areas can permanently enhance economic capacity. Beyond Hartlepool, we estimate a national fleet roll out of 40 Xe-100s could bring around £20bn of investment into the UK.”",
            "The multi-disciplinary study will use expertise from Teesside University International Business School and its School of Social Sciences, Humanities & Law in various fields including public policy, economic regeneration, business and industry. It will include a review of available socio-economic data and engagement with local stakeholders including government officials, community leaders and sector experts. The study will also examine national impacts, including contributions to meeting the UK Government’s net zero targets. The assessment will begin immediately and complete later this year."

The nuclear qualification came after an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III Division I NCA 3300 (NCA 3800), NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations.",
            "Ian Nicholls, group technical director, at Sheffield Forgemasters, said, “We undertook the ASME audit in November and have now received confirmation that the audit recommendation has been approved by the committee. The accreditation is a huge development with heightened requirements and protocols embracing all our processes, employees and selected sub-suppliers.”",
            "The qualification followed the company’s announcement of a ground-breaking development in the acceleration of welding for large nuclear vessels, using Electron Beam Welding to reduce more than a year’s worth of manual welding to less than 24 hours. In February Sheffield Forgemasters completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW).",
            "Nicholls added: “The ASME accreditation, coupled with our development of Electron Beam Welding for large diameter, nuclear grade vessels, places Sheffield Forgemasters at the pinnacle of development for small modular reactors and presents significant possibilities for the UK’s domestic nuclear new-build programme.”",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters is the only company in the UK capable of manufacturing reactor vessel components for SMRs, and this together with the ASME status, gives the company capability in delivery of advanced power-generation technology.

The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa. X-energy was selected by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 to receive up to $1.2bn in matching funds under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to develop, license, build, and demonstrate an operational advanced reactor and fuel fabrication facility by the end of the decade. X-Energy has since completed the reactor engineering and basic design and is developing a fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge in Tennessee.",
            "X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear are proposing to develop a multi-billion pound 12-reactor plant at Hartlepool, to be ready by the early 2030s. The companies plan to build a fleet of up to 40 of the advanced small modular Xe-100 reactors in the UK, creating thousands of high-quality jobs in construction and operations. This would provide 3,200 MW of electricity, enough power for 6 million homes, or 8,000 MW of versatile high temperature heat and steam to support zero-carbon manufacturing and industrial processes.",
            "X-energy and Cavendish also announced a partnership with the UK Kier Group to support constructability and supply chain analyses. The UK’s Sheffield Forgemasters and the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (NAMRC) ae also supporting X-energy and Cavendish in completing the scope outlined in their FNEF proposal. The goal is for 80% of the value of the Xe-100 projects to flow to UK firms. Last year X-energy and Cavendish signed a memorandum of understanding with Glasgow-based gas circulator manufacturer Howden. They will also work with Nuclear Waste Services to review the approach to spent fuel management. The companies plan to engage with the UK nuclear regulators to evaluate approaches to licensing the Xe-100 AMR. The design is already progressing through initial assessments by nuclear regulators in Canada and the United States.",
            "“We are backing innovation in nuclear – from building large-scale plants better to encouraging new advanced technologies – to achieve our ambition for a quarter of our electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050,” Minister for Nuclear & Renewables Andrew Bowie said. “This funding supports the next step in the development of advanced modular reactors and shows our commitment to keeping the UK at the forefront of nuclear technology.”",

Non-nuclear construction will begin on the Natrium reactor demonstration project this summer and nuclear construction will begin only after the application is approved by NRC.",
            "“We will continue working closely with local stakeholders, elected officials and regulatory partners as we begin non-nuclear construction this year while working through this application process with the NRC,” said Chris Levesque, President & CEO of TerraPower. “This milestone is one of many that paves the way toward clean, reliable and flexible power for the grid and long-term jobs for the Kemmerer community.”",
            "In November 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, announced an ageing coal plant owned by US PacifiCorp, in Kemmerer, Wyoming, as the preferred site for the Natrium reactor demonstration project. Natrium is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology and is one of two competitively-selected Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) projects supported by the US Department of Energy (DOE).",
            "The Natrium technology is a TerraPower and GE-Hitachi technology featuring a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology is intended to boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed to integrate with variable renewable energy sources. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners.",

This fully pumped molten salt loop tested key components including pumps, heaters, freeze valves, flanges, and instrumentation over time.",
            "In 2020, DOE selected the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE) proposal, with Southern Company as the lead, as a winner of the ARDP risk-reduction pathway. DOE awarded TerraPower $80m in initial funding to demonstrate its Natrium technology. In February 2022, TerraPower and Southern Company finalised an agreement to design, construct and operate the MCRE at Idaho National Laboratory under the ARDP.",
            "Southern Company and TerraPower are working on an Integrated Effects Test (IET) to learn how the MCFR technology will scale and behave at larger, commercially relevant sizes. The IET was commissioned and began operating in TerraPower’s Everett, Washington, facility in October 2023.",
            "TerraPower’s demonstration plant, planned for Kemmerer is intended to validate the design, construction, and operational features of the Natrium technology. However, in December 2022, TerraPower postponed the expected start date of the reactor by at least of two years.",
            "The company had originally hoped to commission the plant in 2028 using Russian-supplied high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel to get the demonstration unit up and running by 2028. The conflict in Ukraine, however, has made continuing Russian HALEU deliveries unlikely and the US has yet to develop its own supplies. The projected commissioning date is now 2030. Volume 2 of the IRP comprises more than 400 pages of appendices. The Appendix on regulatory compliance includes the following comment: “Finally, we acknowledge the inherent complexities with the Natrium project and direct the Company to continue to assess the risks of technology viability and potential delays with Natrium and plan accordingly.”",
            "Nevertheless, US PacifiCorp, owner of the Kemmerer site, in its 2023 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) considered the possible addition of two more Natrium units to the company’s generation resource mix by 2033, under certain circumstances. These could be sited in Utah near currently operating coal-fired facilities. TerraPower says it remains confident that the US supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035.",

X-Energy in 2023 also signed a joint development agreement with utility Energy Northwest for the deployment of up to 12 Xe-100 SMRs.",
            "“The opening of X-energy’s first Plant Support Centre marks another stride forward to the deployment of our first Xe-100 reactors,” said X-energy CEO J Clay Sell. “Today represents an evolution in nuclear operator training and learning, equipped with cutting-edge, high-fidelity simulation and virtual reality technology.

        "title": "NEA launches second edition of its Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published the second edition of its",
            "Small Modular Reactor Dashboard",
            "which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "The 188-page review assesses of the progress of SMRs globally, “highlighting substantial developments towards first-of-a-kind deployment in a rapidly evolving field”. While the technical features of the different SMR technologies may be well understood, NEA notes that gaps remain in understanding the speed with which they are approaching widespread commercialisation.",
            "NEA identified 98 SMR technologies around the world, 56 of which are included in this second edition. The other 42 include approximately seven that are under development but requested not to be included at this time but may be included in the future. The others “include SMR technologies that are not under active development, may be without human or financial resources, or have been cancelled or paused indefinitely”.",
            "This compares with 21 designs detailed in the first edition published in March 2023, which was followed by a 60-page supplement in July 2023, tracking the progress of an additional 21 SMRs. As well as detailing the technology readiness level of SMRs, the Dashboard also assesses progress across six “additional enabling conditions” – licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The assessments are based on progress up to a cutoff date of 10 November 2023.",
            "NEA says it exclusively used information from verifiable public sources, mostly from third party references such as governments, regulators, financiers, operators). “None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing.” Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by NEA and provided with a list of the sources used to compile the assessment. They were given the opportunity to comment and supplement further information. NEA says: “If this further information was independently verified, it has been used in the final published assessment”.",
            "In his Foreword, NEA Director General William D Magwood IV says: “Progress since the publication of the inaugural volume of the NEA SMR Dashboard has been rapid and is accelerating, with multiple projects moving from conceptual design, licensing and siting to breaking ground on construction.” He notes that there are already SMRs deployed and operating in China and Russia as well as one test reactor in Japan. Developments over the past year include the licensing of the first non-water-cooled reactor design in the US to be approved for construction in 50 years, the selection of new sites to power heavy industry applications, the start of civil works for SMR projects in Canada and the US, and progress in other areas such as financing, engagement and fuel.",
            "He adds that this second edition also offers new insight into the emerging commercial structure of the SMR industry. “While experience from other industries suggests that only a limited subset of SMR designs will survive through to deployment, the NEA SMR Dashboard outlines the benefits of having such a diversity of designs under development. It may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economic case for SMR deployment. The advanced materials and engineering solutions under development carry further benefits for industrial uses and applications beyond the nuclear sector.”",
            "However, the review also “captures setbacks for multiple SMR developers, reminding decision makers in the public and private sectors of remaining challenges, particularly for SMR licensing, economic competitiveness and fuel”. Waste management considerations are also critical and will be further assessed in future editions of the Dashboard.",
            "The Dashboard reports that the 56 SMR designs under active development, include 18 by SMR design organisations headquartered in North America, 16 in Europe and seven in Asia. Fifteen SMR design organisations are headquartered in the United States, seven in France, four in China, three in Canada two in Japan, and two in Russia.",
            "As to technologies, several innovative concepts are under development and nearing commercialisation and deployment. Some are based on traditional light water reactor concepts while others are Generation IV concepts, many of which use new coolants and moderators. Various reactor configurations are also envisaged, with both land-based and marine-based approaches proposed, as well as mobile and multi-module configurations.",
            "In summary, the review concludes that, while a few SMRs are already operating, there is a robust pipeline of SMRs making progress towards first-of-a-kind (FOAK) deployment. “A large number of SMRs are presently conceptual. The breadth of designs may create opportunities to consolidate global supply chains, foster standardisation and improve the economics of SMRs for commercialisation.",
            "Key findings in the areas of licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel for SMRs are:",
            "China and Russia are leading on deployment;",
            "Some regulators are taking steps towards regulatory frameworks that support large-scale deployment of SMRs, through early collaborations and joint reviews between regulators.",
            "There is real and rapid progress towards deployment in North America and Europe;",
            "Sites for industrial applications are starting to emerge, highlighting the capacity of SMRs to broaden the value proposition of nuclear power by targeting new industrial applications.",
            "SMR development is primarily driven by public-private partnerships, particularly during the development phases;",
            "Financing frameworks are enhanced with power purchase agreements or off-take agreements to mitigate price uncertainty. Addressing construction risks may require the use of cost- and risk-sharing approaches between governments and the private sector, or forming industrial consortia to distribute risks among multiple stakeholders and across a larger number of projects.",
            "Emerging SMR supply chains are characterised by intense collaborations to reduce deployment risks, with many SMRs making good progress in establishing supply chains;",
            "Many collaborations involve contracts with engineering, procurement and construction companies, indicating that supply chains are gearing up for deployment, with near-term and accelerating timelines. However, most efforts are focused on successfully delivering FOAK projects, and there are still no signs of a structural paradigm shift towards fleet deployment.",
            "Many SMR developers recognise the strategic importance of engaging with key stakeholders to build trust. Engagement efforts are focused on securing policy and community buy-in, talent pipeline, and first markets.",
            "New fuel types are being developed for a number of SMRs. Some new fuel types have reached commercial maturity and others still require additional development;",
            "Over 50% of the designs evaluated for the Dashboard are planning to use high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU). While HALEU is a technically proven fuel type, as of 2023 there was a lack of large-scale, commercial supply in OECD countries, which could delay deployment of some SMRs.",
            "On licensing, the report notes that China and Russia are leading deployment. For 23 SMR designs there is no information available on licensing or pre-licensing activities. Some 20 designs are in the pre-licensing process. Five have submitted a licence application – NuScale Power’s VOYGR-6 SMR and Kairos Power’s Hermes demonstration reactor in the US; GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 in Canada; Rosatom’s floating RITM-200S in Russia; and CGN’s floating ACPR50S in China). One has design approval – SMART SMR design. Four have construction licence approval – Argentina’s Carem SMR, China’s ACP100 and Russia’s RITM-200N and the lead-cooled, fast-spectrum BREST-OD-300. Only three are already licensed to operate – China’s HTR-PM, Russia’s floating KLT-40S and Japan’s High Temperature Test Reactor (HTTR).",
            "On siting, in addition to the seven operating and under construction, 17 SMRs have been selected by site owners for deployment. These include Westinghouse’s eVinci microreactor, Radiant Industries’ Kaleidos SMR and Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation’s (UNSC’s) Pylon D1 have been selected for deployment at the US Idaho National Laboratory’s (INL). X-energy’s Xe-100 was selected by Dow Chemical for deployment at its Seadrift facility in Texas.",
            "In addition, 14 SMRs have non-binding agreements with site owners including, BWX Technologies’ BANR with the Wyoming Energy Authority and Tata Chemicals Soda Ash Partners (TCSAP) in the US; University of West Bohemia’s TEPLATOR SMR with Slavutych city in Ukraine; and Westinghouse’s Westinghouse LFR with SCK CEN and RATEN for potential deployment in Mol, Belgium, and Pitesti, Romania. For 18 SMRs, there is no readily available siting information.",
            "On financing, NEA says Russia’s floating RITM-200S reactor is the only SMR that has already demonstrated progress towards Nth Of A Kind (NOAK) financing. There are 11 SMRs assessed to have their FOAK fully financed. In addition to the SMRs that are already operating or under construction, two FOAK projects are fully financed in the US (Kairos Power’s Hermes and BWX Technologies’ Project Pele), one in Canada (GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300), one in China (CGN’s ACPR50S), and one in Russia (Rosatom’s RITM-200N)",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. TerraPower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although TerraPower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with HALEU fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci.",

            "US-based Kairos Power has signed a technology investment agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) to put into effect the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ADRP) risk reduction award, which the company received in 2020. Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303m on a performance-based, fixed-price milestone basis to enable the design, construction, and commissioning of the company’s Hermes demonstration reactor. A construction permit for the reactor was issued by the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in December 2023.",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s. Hermes is to be built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",
            "Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO, noted: “With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.”",
            "DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Assistant Secretary Dr Kathryn Huff said the Hermes reactor “is an important step toward realising advanced nuclear energy’s role in ushering forward the nation’s clean energy transition”. She added: “Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.”",
            "The KP-HFR is one of five teams selected in 2020 by the DOE to receive $30m in initial funding for risk reduction projects under the ARDP. The other projects were Westinghouse Electric Company’s eVinci Microreactor, the BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR), Holtec’s SMR-160 Reactor, and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment. DOE had earlier in 2020 selected TerraPower and X-energy to receive $160m in initial funding for ARDP Demonstration projects to develop two advanced nuclear reactors to be operational within seven years.",

        "text": [
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW). Sheffield Forgemasters Research, Design & Technology Director Jesus Talamantes-Silva said the company had achieved “a significant milestone in assembling a nuclear vessel demonstrator, using electron beam welding for the first time at this scale, with 100% success and no defects”.",
            "Completing four, thick, nuclear-grade welds took less than 24 hours – work which typically requires a year. \"With a diameter of three metres and a wall thickness of 200mm, construction of the vessel showcases the reliability and capabilities of LEBW, setting a dramatic new standard for weld-joining thick-walled components, previously untrialled in a demonstrator model,\" the company noted.",
            "The operation deployed specially developed parameters, meticulously fine-tuned during the welding development stage, including innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld, ensuring a clean and complete weld-join.",
            "Senior development engineer and project lead Michael Blackmore believes the implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental, potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation. \"Not only does this reduce the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material, but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the UK and beyond, that's how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters said demonstrating LEBW technology's potential opens new horizons for \"more efficient, low-cost and less time-heavy nuclear assemblies\" with far-reaching implications for other projects which require thick-walled welded assemblies.",
            "Jacob Pope, development engineer and LEBW machine tool installation lead said: “We thank the government's Department for Energy Security & Net Zero for enabling the project through its Nuclear Innovation Programme. We also thank our esteemed partner, Cambridge Vacuum Engineering, for their invaluable support throughout this endeavour. Their remote and on-site assistance played an instrumental role in the success of this milestone, highlighting the collaborative spirit that drives us forward.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters, which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, is the only UK company able to manufacture the large forgings required for SMRs. The company said future activities include a joint industrial project “supported by key participants from the USA and UK”. The aim is “to initiate a code case or multiple cases to facilitate the deployment of this technology in accordance with the standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)”.",
            "In December, the company said it was on track to regain ASME status as a supplier of heavy forgings and castings to the civil nuclear market. An ASME Section III Division I NCA 3300, NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, has recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations. This would allow it supply castings and forgings (material) for civil nuclear applications and also be qualified to carry out weld construction activities on these materials.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK. Under the MOU, X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK.",
            "Earlier, in February 2023, the company signed an MOU with with Holtec Britain to design components for Holtec’s SMR-160 SMR and identify the best routes to manufacture. This followed similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, SFI and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 SFI signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK.",

        "title": "Nuclear’s pursuit of synfuels",
        "text": [
            "Nuclear as a low-carbon energy source is an attractive alternative and has been gaining growing interest. (Credit: Markus Distelrath from Pixabay)",
            "Governments are increasingly recognising that net zero solutions must be found and implemented urgently in order to meet global decarbonisation targets. Despite the impressive growth of renewables, almost all credible pathways to net zero argue this will require more than a green electricity system. Renewables and other forms of low-carbon electricity are certainly important, but decarbonising transport and heavy industry will also need low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels. As Luis del Barrio, partner at the Madrid office of the energy & utilities practice at Arthur D. Little explains: “Electricity is not the only solution. In order to really achieve decarbonisation, we need a broader portfolio and toolkit.”",
            "One area of growing interest is synthetic fuels or synfuels, low-carbon equivalents of conventional liquid fossil fuels. Indeed, Dr Charles Forsberg, principal research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), notes: “In the US oil products provide almost half the energy to the final consumer: residential, commercial, industrial and transportation. Electricity is less than 20% of the energy delivered to the final customer. Replace oil and decarbonise half the economy. The implied market for hydrogen and heat is larger than the electricity market.”",
            "Typically, synfuels are compliant with international fuel standards and possess the same energy density as their fossil fuel equivalents. They can be deployed in sectors that are often considered hard to reach, notably transport. Unlike biofuels, synfuels are not necessarily reliant on organic materials to provide the molecular inputs of carbon and hydrogen. They therefore have a greater potential to scale to the larger volumes needed.",
            "Crucially, these drop-in synfuels are able to use the same distribution infrastructure and, perhaps more importantly, existing assets like aircraft or heavy goods vehicles, without modification. Conserving existing internal combustion engines and all of the related fuel infrastructure represents both a considerable carbon saving and a substantial economic gain.",
            "“A plane that runs with kerosene can run with synfuels without any modification. We don’t have to make any modification in almost the entire supply chain. For the production of aviation fuel we just change the oil refineries to hydrogen production plants, the same for ships and heavy duty trucks. Therefore, if we have a circular economic vision, synthetic fuel could be the most sustainable way to decarbonise the economy because we are increasing the life of existing assets and as a result, we are reducing the amount of raw materials that we are going to need,” says del Barrio.",
            "Given one of the key inputs for synfuels is hydrogen, low-carbon routes to hydrogen production are needed if they are to replace fossil fuels. Much of the focus of low-carbon hydrogen to date has been related to renewables such as wind and solar. However, nuclear as a low-carbon energy source is an attractive alternative and has been gaining growing interest. As del Barrio says: “To meet decarbonisation targets, nuclear synthetic fuels are going to be needed if we want to do it in an efficient and economical way. There are some countries and regions where nuclear is still not seen as a part of the decarbonisation solution, my view is it is one of the most relevant parts.”",
            "Importantly, del Barrio highlights a number of the key benefits of nuclear-produced hydrogen in relation to that generated by renewables. He emphasises nuclear’s low cost, security of supply, reliability and flexibility. Another key advantage for nuclear over renewables is the absence of variability. This is crucial for the process side of producing hydrogen. “To achieve cheap hydrogen, we need both low-carbon electricity and electrolysers that run smoothly and for as many hours as possible. Nuclear power plants are the only technology that run 8760 hours per year with minimal downtime for maintenance,” says del Barrio.",
            "A recent report by the Nuclear Industry Association (NIA) also highlights the characteristics of nuclear that favour its use in synfuels production. For instance, nuclear heat output can be used to provide desalination for the clean water required for hydrogen production from electrolysis. In addition, nuclear power can supply the energy needed for direct carbon capture technology and thus can create a closed carbon loop.",
            "Given these advantages, together with its energy density and longevity, nuclear is clearly the winner when it comes to the technical aspects of producing hydrogen from low carbon sources.",
            "It is also increasingly clear that should nuclear become established as a key source of synfuels production, the economic opportunities are substantial. According to the NIA, the global market for conventional aviation fuel alone is currently predicted to be $240b by 2026 and the global synthetic fuels market valued at $15.3bn by 2030 and $600bn by 2050. Furthermore, the NIA says, based on a survey of eight leading analyst organisations, the average prediction of the market share that synthetic fuels could achieve is over 42% of the total 2050 aviation fuel market.",
            "Should nuclear be deployed at the scales envisaged to replace liquid fossil fuels, it represents a massive market boost for nuclear deployment. As Forsberg says: “Ultimately, liquid hydrocarbon fuels could be the largest single market for nuclear energy.”",
            "With these kind of figures in mind the economic case for nuclear synfuel becomes compelling. “Nuclear power plants that are already completely amortised have a low cost of electricity. Running the power plant for 8760 hours with an electrolyser supports cheap hydrogen. Our analysis suggests costs below EUR2.5/kg. At this cost, synthetic fuels are competitive against other fuels like ethanol or pure kerosene. More importantly, it is much cheaper than direct electrification of transport,” del Barrio explains, referring to the process of replacing technologies like internal combustion engines that use fossil fuels with technologies like motors that use electricity directly as a source of energy. He continues: “by using nuclear to produce synthetic fuels we are able to reduce the total cost of decarbonisation for consumers. Because we are using less resources it’s also going to be more efficient, cheaper, and quicker than other options. Nuclear synthetic fuel production will be an important part of the solution for decarbonisation because the cost is going to be lower than if we have to produce synthetic fuel with renewable energy sources,” concludes del Barrio.",
            "Barriers to nuclear deployment",
            "Given the obvious advantages of nuclear-derived synfuels, their uptake has nonetheless been muted to date, although a number of small pilot nuclear hydrogen projects have already been launched. For example, in the US, Constellation Energy has launched a demonstration project at its Nine Mile Point Power Station in New York. Part of a $14.5m cost-shared project with the US Department of Energy (DOE), Constellation will use the hydrogen generated on-site to help cool the power plant. The DOE supported the construction and installation of a low-temperature electrolysis system at the plant that leverages the facility’s existing hydrogen storage system. The system started production in February. Similarly, in the UK EDF’s Heysham 2 plant is set for a pilot solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) that will produce hydrogen for use in the production of asphalt and cement for construction materials supplier Heidelberg Materials, formerly known as Hanson. Government funding is going toward final design with a possible construction start date sometime in 2024.",
            "Once the technology is proven it should be feasible to gain both governmental and private sector financial support. Nonetheless, despite such highlights it is evident that some barriers remain to widespread roll out of nuclear hydrogen and with it the subsequent synfuels market.",
            "According to del Barrio, these barriers are largely not technical issues but rather policy challenges, notably public concerns that relate to safety and waste management coupled with the historic cost and construction overruns for large reactors that have also curtailed nuclear in general.",
            "As del Barrio observes: “There is no major technical reason, rather it’s a political opinion.”",
            "There certainly are political considerations. Post-Chornobyl and Fukushima, environmental campaigners argue that nuclear power is prohibitively dangerous as well as expensive and that plants take too long to build. Meanwhile waste management has always been contentious. Those attitudes are changing though as recognition of the looming climate catastrophe casts nuclear in a new light.",
            "In addition, with advances in small modular reactors (SMR’s) some of the economic and timeframe arguments traditionally associated with large light water reactors become less significant.",
            "del Barrio notes that while some issues, such as waste management, have served to impede the growth of nuclear, technical solutions are certainly possible. Further, he contrasts the remote risk of nuclear accident against the very real risk of catastrophic climate change, saying: “At the end of the day the risk of a nuclear disaster is small in comparison with the risks of a 1.5 degree increase in global average temperature.” He emphasises the relative impact on biodiversity, economic development, health and safety of a nuclear disaster in stark contrast to the impact of climate change. del Barrio all but dismisses the nuclear risks on that basis: “It’s a relatively local problem when compared with a super global problem for the population”.",
            "But alongside the political challenges, Forsberg highlights potential economic risks for nuclear synfuels given the volatility in oil prices. “The biggest barrier for any alternative hydrocarbon liquid fuel is actually the variability in the price of oil. At $100 a barrel, some of these nuclear systems will become economic, the problem is what happens if your plant goes online when the price of crude oil is $35 a barrel?” Forsberg argues that in order secure investment in a new method of producing liquid hydrocarbon fuels some constraints must be placed on fossil fuels such as enforcing a robust carbon price to artificially increase the consumer cost of fossil fuels or alternatively a guaranteed minimum price for low-carbon equivalents.",
            "Alongside hydrogen, the production of hydrocarbon synfuels also requires carbon. Carbon can come from various sources, including carbon capture from industrial processes or direct capture from the atmosphere. However, while direct capture raises the possibility of a circular carbon economy, del Barrio notes there are some technical issues that must be overcome: “ultimately where CO2 is derived from the air the technology is still not commercially viable. That technology is a little bit far away and quite expensive.” Instead, he points to another readily available source of carbon – biomass and waste valorisation.",
            "“In order to make competitive synthetic fuel, we need two things, cheap CO2 and cheap hydrogen,” del Barrio explains, adding: “From biomass or biomethane production, you can have large amounts of CO2 that can be captured and that is renewable or biogenic carbon dioxide. The problem is that there is not enough biomass feed stock for all the transport sector, we need both nuclear synfuel and biofuel to complement each other.” He goes on to suggest that using the CO2 from biofuels together with nuclear-produced hydrogen could result in a symbiotic partnership with many benefits for both the industry and wider society: “We need the CO2 from biofuel production in order to produce the synthetic fuels, they are working together to achieve the cheapest solution.”",
            "He envisages future refineries which use biomass as a raw feed stock and which together with an on-site reactor becomes a major source of low carbon liquid fuels, some of which are biogenic in origin and others which are nuclear synfuels.",
            "While conventional biofuel production largely relies on fermentation or anaerobic digestion, cellulosic biomass – made from non-food crops and waste such as corn waste, straw or wood – has traditionally been far more challenging as a biofuel feed stock.",
            "Forsberg says: “Currently most biofuels are from plant oils, sugar and carbohydrates because it takes less refining to convert to liquid fuels. However, feedstock is limited and conflicts with food production.” He identifies the vast quantities of cheaply available cellulosic biomass as an alternative: “It is the only feedstock option if you require massive quantities of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. There are no other choices. The first few cellulosic biomass to bio-crude oil plants are beginning operations and the most important outcome of our work is that we really can replace crude oil. Reality is slowly sinking in”.",
            "He points to the potential role of nuclear in the use of cellulosic biomass in synfuel production and argues cellulosic biomass is a valuable and scalable source of carbon. Cellulosic biofuels can replace all crude oil but only with massive heat and hydrogen inputs. There is insufficient feed stock if biomass is used as the carbon source for the biofuels and the energy source for the conversion process and to produce the necessary hydrogen. However, he envisages gradual deployment rather than a rapid distribution. “Development of a nuclear-assisted cellulosic biofuels world will be an evolutionary development. There will be no grand opening of a new nuclear-assisted biorefinery.”",
            "Forsberg identifies several key trends that are underway, and which plot a path for nuclear synfuel deployment in conjunction with a burgeoning biofuels sector. “Our analysis supports using existing refineries with front end changes to accept various biomass feed stocks. That is already happening. The original biofuels model was the stand-alone biofuels plant producing a final product for the customer. Most of the recent announcements are different biofuels companies producing bio-crudes shipped to local refineries. That is all driven by economics and we see acceleration of that trend.”",
            "He also mentions the attractive heat characteristics of nuclear power which complement the massive heat demands of chemical plants and refineries. Forsberg highlights the recent announcement by DOW Chemical which intends to install four high-temperature SMRs at the Seadrift chemical site in Texas. Featuring X-energy’s Xe-100 SMR design, DOW’s project aims to deliver power and steam production to match the sites requirements with zero carbon emissions. Each reactor will produce 200 MW of heat, collectively delivering 800 MW of heat. DOW estimate a 400,000 tonne reduction of CO2 emissions per year. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed by the end of this decade. Forsberg comments: “What is noteworthy is that these reactors are designed for the chemical market that includes refineries”. The heat inputs to the chemical and biofuels industries may exceed the existing heat outputs of the current nuclear fleet. The near-term hydrogen source will likely be natural gas to hydrogen with sequestering carbon dioxide where there is cheap natural gas and good sequestration sites. Nuclear is the hydrogen everywhere choice.",
            "Despite the political and economic challenges, del Barrio is emphatic that the nuclear resurgence is significant for a future synfuels market.",
            "“When you take the lifecycle costs you will see that synthetic fuels running on nuclear power plants are the cheapest option and are needed to achieve the total decarbonisation of the economy,” he continues, “as nations start building reactors and getting these new machines online, that will then lead to synthetic fuel production, then we need to use that tool to decarbonise our liquid fuels transport system”.",
            "del Barrio concludes: “There are countries that are already pushing for nuclear power and when they have nuclear power, they will have nuclear synthetic fuels.”",
            "Asked about the global situation Dr Forsberg sums up: “The way I would put it is that we’re stumbling around in the dark if you look at a lot of carbon policies. They’re based more on what we wish to be true rather than what is true. The engineering realities at the end of the day, like available forms of carbon are going to drive things.”",
            "Dr Forsberg also highlights the role of nuclear in meeting the need for low-carbon energy: “You need steady-state heat for the chemical industry which matches nuclear. In a low-carbon world, your options are limited, you either burn-natural gas with carbon capture or use nuclear. You have an industry that intrinsically needs an awful lot of heat, which of course nuclear reactors produce.”",
            "Looking ahead del Barrio is also optimistic: “In the fifties we were dreaming of having nuclear cars and I think in the future we are going to run vehicles on nuclear, because we will have synthetic fuels produced with nuclear fuels. That’s going to be a reality. Whether they run on electricity that is coming from nuclear power plants, whether they’re running on fuel that is coming from nuclear power plants, at the end of the day, nuclear is going to be a part of the solution.”"

The review did identify some technical areas requiring further development \"in order for X-energy to better demonstrate adherence to CNSC requirements\", it said. Some of these will be addressed in a Phase 3 VDR, which enables a vendor to seek further information from the CNSC about Phase 2 issues. During Phase 3, a vendor may also ask the regulator to review activities taken with respect to the reactor's design readiness, following the completion of Phase 2.",

            "The Xe-100 is a high-temperature gas reactor with a thermal output of 200 MWt or an electrical output of 80 MWe. It is one of two designs selected by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 to receive up to $1.2bn in matching funds under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) to develop, license, build, and demonstrate an operational advanced reactor and fuel fabrication facility by the end of the decade. X-energy has since completed the reactor engineering and basic design and is developing a fuel fabrication facility in Oak Ridge in Tennessee.",
            "The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa. It will use TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprising three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.",
            "Northwest said new nuclear energy technologies, such as advanced small modular reactors (SMRs) “are approaching commercial readiness and feature enhanced safety systems; simplified, standardised, and scalable designs; and the ability to both swiftly integrate with renewables and provide around-the-clock electricity – without producing any greenhouse gas emissions”.",
            "Energy Northwest CEO Bob Schuetz said the partnership with Puget Sound Energy “underscores our shared commitment to address the climate challenge and meet the region's future clean energy needs with the help of new and innovative carbon-free nuclear energy technologies”.",
            "Mary Kipp​, President & CEO of Puget Sound Energy, said: “Our clean energy future depends on finding reliable resources that produce energy when customers need it without emitting greenhouse gases. Advanced nuclear technology has the potential to be that resource.”"

            "The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has signed another memorandum of understanding (MOUs) related to small modular reactors at the 28th Conference of the Parties to the original 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai. The latest agreement is with Terrestrial Energy, signed by ENEC CEO Mohamed Al Hammadi, and Terrestrial Energy CEO Simon Irish.",
            "This followed previous agreements with US-based small modular reactor (SMR) and micro-reactor developers X-energy, Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation (USNC) GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH), TerraPower and Westinghouse Electric as well as with UK-based developer of molten salt nuclear technology MoltexFLEX.",
            "The agreements came after ENEC launched its ADVANCE programme, in the run up to CO28, aimed at leveraging the UAE’s experience in successfully delivering the four-unit Barakah NPP, constructed in Abu Dhabi by a South Korean consortium. ENEC said the ADVANCE programme is intended to harness the latest advancements in nuclear energy technologies and to strengthen the UAE's position as a leading nation in accelerating the global clean energy transition to Net Zero. The programme will evaluate the latest SMR and microreactor technologies and ENEC will work with national stakeholders to determine deployment pathways and international partners for technology and project collaboration opportunities.",
            "Terresrial is developing an Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR) plant. The IMSR is a 442 MWt per Core-unit (IMSR400) small modular molten salt fuelled, graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactor. Terrestrial Energy has developed a two-unit configuration which can deliver 884 MWt/390 MWe. The design features a completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers and shutdown rods all mounted inside a single vessel – the IMSR core-unit. The sealed core-unit is replaced completely at the end of its useful service life (nominally seven years). This allows factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. Terrestrial says it operates at the high temperature required for broad industrial relevance with transformative economic potential.",
            "ENEC and Terrestrial Energy will collaborate to focus on the potential of IMSR plant for electricity generation and for large-scale industrial heat applications. These uses include the IMSR plant’s role in decarbonising energy-intensive and hard-to-abate industrial sectors. The parties will also consider frameworks for development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications in the UAE and other markets.",
            "H.E. Mohamed Al Hammadi commented: “We are committed to exploring the latest technologies in advanced reactors as we continue to rapidly decarbonise the power sector through clean electricity from nuclear energy…. We look forward to close collaboration with Terrestrial Energy as we identify the potential deployment of IMSR technology in the UAE and overseas.”",
            "Simon Irish said the IMSR has immense potential to support industrial growth and decarbonisation. “Terrestrial Energy’s prioritisation of national and international regulatory requirements supports the aims of our MOU as does the IMSR’s use of nuclear fuel at standard enrichment levels, which has long-established international acceptance. We look forward to working with ENEC to accelerate development and deployment of the IMSR plant in target industrial applications and commercial markets.”",
            "In April 2023, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), following a systematic and multi-year review against Canadian regulatory requirements, concluded that there were no fundamental barriers to licensing the IMSR plant for commercial use. This was the first regulatory review of a commercial nuclear plant using molten salt reactor technology and the first advanced, high-temperature fission technology to complete a review of this type.",
            "The conventional nuclear power plant fuel used by the IMSR – Standard Assay Low Enriched Uranium – is the only fuel available and transportable today for civilian reactor use and has international regulatory acceptance. Its use supports an early deployment path for IMSR plants across multiple markets. In August 2023, Terrestrial Energy signed a manufacturing and supply contract with Springfields Fuels Limited, a UK-based subsidiary of Westinghouse, for the design and construction of an IMSR fuel pilot plant."

Under the MOU with a joint working group will be set up to examine the commercial viability of deploying MoltexFLEX's 60 MWt/24 MWe FLEX molten salt reactor in the UAE. The FLEX reactor design – a thermal neutron (moderated) version of Moltex Energy's stable salt reactor technology – was launched by Moltex Energy subsidiary MoltexFLEX in September 2022.",
            "ENEC and MoltexFLEX will assess using FLEX reactors for a range of industrial applications including desalination, hydrogen production and electricity generation. “We will also explore opportunities throughout the Middle East and beyond, which is aligned with MoltexFLEX’s vision for global deployment of the FLEX reactor,” Landon said.",
            "ENEC’s MOU with USNC seeks to jointly explore commercial development of USNC's Micro-Modular Reactor (MMR) energy systems and paves the way for potential commercialisation of the MMR in the UAE, USNC said. Further areas of collaboration within the UAE include workforce and supply chain development and project delivery, along with a potential framework for ENEC to lead MMR deployments across the region in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and other areas covered by the Three Seas Initiative. Dr Francesco Venneri, USNC Founder & CEO said the MMR “will play an important role for Emiratis as the nation continues towards deep decarbonisation hand-in-hand with prosperity for Emiratis and other nations across the region”.",
            "The MMR features the high temperature helium-cooled MMR unit providing up to 45 MWt of heat, delivered into a centralised heat storage unit which can combine the heat from one or more reactors. Electric power or superheated steam can then be extracted from the storage unit for various uses. USNC has also developed and patented its own TRISO-based, additively manufactured FCM fuel for use in the MMR.",
            "The MOU with X-energy, signed by Al Hammadi and X-energy CEO Clay Sell will see the two parties work together to assess technical design and commercial viability of X-energy's nuclear technologies for the UAE market, to meet the growing demand for clean electricity generation, along with generating steam, heat and hydrogen to decarbonise industry. The companies will also evaluate potential project partnerships for developments in the UK and Europe and will develop a regional deployment framework for ENEC-led projects in the Middle East, Africa, and Indian subcontinent, X-energy said.",

            "The statement on the MOU said the agreement also helps advance the US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and aims to help catalyse $100bn in clean energy and decarbonisation projects by 2035. A White House fact sheet noted that PACE “intends to tap available resources and public and private sector expertise in the US and the UAE and expedite investment in and deployment of new technologies to drive down cost”. PACE also “supports the full-scale implementation of the civil nuclear cooperation between the US and the UAE. The three earlier MOUs with GEH, TerraPower and Westinghouse also cited PACE as the context for their co-operation with ENEC, indicating the key role of the US in the signing of these agreements.",

        "title": "Novel fuels set for growth",
        "text": [
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing. (Credit: 2427999 from Pixabay)",
            "The global market for nuclear fuel is steadily developing as the recent energy crisis and climate change concerns are allowing nuclear generation to experience something of a renaissance. According to IAEA forecasts, by 2050 the global nuclear power plant fleet will more than double its current capacity: from almost 380 GW now to 873 GW. However, the Agency notes that the increase will be largely achieved through nuclear technologies that are now just being developed and tested, including those which involve the use of novel fuels.",
            "Today, about 30 companies from two dozen countries produce nuclear fuel for land-based reactors. The total volume of nuclear fuel production capacity is not so large – about 20,000 tonnes per year. The three largest producers – French company Framatome, US-based Westinghouse and Russia’s TVEL – supply approximately half of this total production volume.",
            "In recent years many of these producers have accelerated their activities in the field of development of novel fuels. At the same time, the current diversity of technical reactor concepts implies an equal diversity of fuel types. As part of these developments, particular attention is being paid to new accident tolerant fuels (ATF).",
            "The development of ATF has become a priority for fuel designers over the last decade, notably in response to an analysis of the causes of the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant which included the zirconium-steam reaction that takes place at temperatures above 1200 °C. There are currently two key pathways to develop ATF technology: to reduce the amount of zirconium in the fuel assembly or to modify the chemical composition of the fuel so that the heat transfer rates of the fuel increases. While it cannot be said that the use of novel fuels will prevent all possible accidents the development of ATF is designed to provide more response time in the event of a rare emergency, as well as to obtain technological and economic advantages during normal operations of the nuclear reactor.",
            "The creation of novel fuel is currently being carried out by all the largest manufacturers as well as other significant players in Europe, the Americas and Asia.",
            "Changing cladding and composition",
            "At present the main ATF efforts of developers are aimed at creating new materials for both cladding and fuel composition. One of the more promising possible solutions is the development of cladding coatings that include chromium in one form or another. Chromium coatings on zirconium alloys provide increased corrosion and wear resistance, as well as reduced hydrogen permeability, which helps maintain the ductility of zirconium alloys. Another option that requires further study, but is potentially interesting for the production of cladding, is composite materials based on silicon carbide.",
            "A universally preferred coating technology has not yet been identified; various manufacturers use different options that they find most suitable. According to Fedor Vysikailo, a professor at the Department of Theoretical Physics at Moscow State University, complex application methods have a high technological, but low economic efficiency.",
            "The methods of heavily doping the surface have the same problem. More promising, according to Vysikailo, are laser application methods. Scientists also note the attractiveness of magnetron methods for coating fuel rods (high application speed and uniformity of coating).",
            "For fuel compositions, options are also being considered that include the addition of chromium or molybdenum, as well as the use of silicides or uranium nitride instead of uranium oxide. New fuel compositions also include doped uranium dioxide (UO2), high-density fuels (eg, U3Si2), and metallic fuels, such as uranium-molybdenum.",
            "Like Westinghouse, Framatome is focused on developing composite-clad fuels. In the long term, the company plans to develop a SiC/SiC composite cladding and Cr2O3-doped uranium dioxide fuel. Currently, Framatome is preparing to manufacture a novel molybdenum-uranium (U-Mo) fuel to extend the life and safe operation of the Forschungsreaktor München II (FRM II) research reactor in Germany and has recently received approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to apply the company’s suite of Advanced Codes and Methods to operating conditions with uranium 235 enrichments above the industry standard of 5%.",
            "The activity of American developers in the area of novel fuels could be partly explained by the aging of the local nuclear fleet – approximately half of the existing units will reach the end of their design life before the mid-2030s and with them the status of the US as one of the world’s largest nuclear fuel importers.",
            "Much of the activity the surrounds novel nuclear fuels is focused of high enrichment low assay uranium (HALEU) which can reach enrichments of up to 20% U235. For example, Centrus is notably beginning first-of-a-kind HALEU production at its American Centrifuge Plant cascade located on the Department of Energy’s Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PORTS) reservation in Piketon, Ohio. According to Dan Leistikow, VP of corporate communications at Centrus, that will be the first new US-owned and US-based technology enrichment plant to start production in 70 years. Centrus’ demonstration project will only deliver an initial 20 kilograms of HALEU before the end of the year, but the company has plans to scale up to 900 kg of annual production starting in 2024.",
            "According to analysts, that will create certain conditions for the beginning of mass production of HALEU in the US, but only in due course.",
            "At the same time another US-based generating company, Southern Nuclear, has announced that it has also received permission from the US NRC to use advanced nuclear fuel enriched with uranium 235 to 6% at the newly commissioned Vogtle nuclear power plant. This is the first time a US commercial reactor has been approved to use fuel enriched above 5%.",
            "Particular hopes are also being raised by the novel nuclear fuel which is being produced by the American-based Lightbridge Corporation. This fuel is reportedly rapidly gaining popularity in the US and some other Western countries.",
            "In case of Russia’s Rosatom and its fuels subsidiary TVEL, the production of novel nuclear fuel is expected to be launched on the basis of Mining and Chemical Combine (MCC) loctaed in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Territory. That will be a mixed oxide uranium-plutonium MOX fuel, that will be used for the world’s most powerful multi-purpose fast neutron research nuclear reactor, the MBIR, with an output of 150 MWth. The reactor is being built at the site of the Rosatom Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (NIIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, in Ulyanovsk region. Commissioning of the reactor is scheduled for the second half of the 2020s.",
            "The capabilities of the MCC make it possible to organise the production of various types of nuclear fuel on its site, while the current MOX fuel which is produced uses depleted uranium and plutonium separated during the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel from thermal reactors.",
            "Rosatom has also plans to more actively promote its advanced nuclear fuel abroad. As part of this, the company has recently offered its advanced nuclear fuel to extend the Indian Kudankulam reactor cycle from 18 months to 2 years. In general, most analysts believe that Russia has good chances to secure a significant share in the global market for advanced fuels, which is partly due to their ability to access cheaper raw materials.",
            "High temperature reactor fuels",
            "The ever-growing interest in small high-temperature gas reactors reactors (HTGR) and the novel nuclear fuel needed for them has become one of the most obvious trends. At the turn of the 1990s–2000s, Japan commissioned a high-temperature technical reactor (HTTR) with a capacity of 30 MW. The fuel for it is TRISO – uranium microspheres packed in a multilayer cladding of silicon carbide and pyrolytic carbon. The main function of the cladding is to retain fission products inside the microsphere and provide mechanical strength. Fuel spheres were placed in tubes, which were assembled into fuel assemblies. Work is underway to further improve the fuel. One option is to replace the silicon carbide in the microsphere cladding with zirconium carbide.",
            "In the US, the production of fuel for HTGRs is being developed by the companies including X-energy, BWXT, and USNC. The state supports R&D on this topic and also invests in the creation of industrial production of such fuel (through AGR, ARDP programs, for instance). In China, the CNNC company is building the HTR-PM project – an HTGR with a capacity of 200 MW. Here microspheres are poured directly into the reactor core in a “pebble bed” technology. This reactor also runs on TRISO fuel. The fuel cores, which are about 0.5 mm in diameter, consist of uranium enriched to 8.9% in a multilayer cladding.",
            "It’s clear that new kinds of nuclear fuels are emerging in response to both a new generation of reactors and new demands for safety and performance. Many of these fuels are still under development but there’s little doubt that novel nuclear fuel is set to become a commercial reality."

            "TerraPower and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy are developing the Natrium technology, which features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe for more than five and a half hours when needed. According to Terrapower, this “allows a Natrium plant to integrate seamlessly with renewable resources and leads to faster, more cost-effective decarbonisation of the electric grid while producing dispatchable carbon-free energy”. The first Natrium plant is being developed in the US in Kemmerer, Wyoming, near a retiring coal plant and is planned to enter operation within a decade. Development of the first Natrium demonstration plant is supported by the US Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",
            "The UAE has a strong civil nuclear programme which began operation in 2020. Construction of its Barakah NPP began in 2011. Korea Electric Power Company (Kepco) led the consortium that is building the plant comprising four APR1400 reactors. To date three units have been connected to the grid and unit 4 completed hot functional testing in July 2023 in preparation for commercial operation in 2024.",
            "ENEC Managing Director & CEO Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, said nuclear is at the heart of UAE’s clean energy progress and strategy. “Our new agreement with TerraPower will facilitate cooperation in taking nuclear energy technology to the next level, by accelerating its deployment and its use for innovating new solutions including the production of clean molecules and hydrogen.”",
            "TerraPower founder and Chairman Bill Gates attended the MOU signing ceremony along with David Livingston, Senior Advisor & Managing Director for Energy for the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate along with other US Government officials. Terrapower the agreement helps advance the US-UAE Partnership for Accelerating Clean Energy (PACE), which was launched in November 2022 and aims to help catalyse $100bn in clean energy and decarbonisation projects by 2035.",
            "A few days before, TerraPower signed an MOU with the US Uranium Energy with objectives of reestablishing domestic supply chains of uranium fuel. TerraPower and UEC will explore the potential supply of uranium for TerraPower’s Natrium reactor and energy storage system. Terrapower said small modular reactors (SMRs) and advanced reactors represent “the fastest growing segment of nuclear energy in the United States and need a secure, domestic fuel supply chain”. The first step of the supply chain is uranium, “and UEC’s Wyoming resources have the critical mass to be a highly reliable source of uranium for American HALEU [high assay low enriched uranium] and a good strategic fit to supply TerraPower’s Natrium reactor”.",
            "Wyoming’s Governor Mark Gordon stated: “This MOU is a great step forward for the Wyoming uranium industry, which is host to the largest uranium reserves in the United States. It makes no sense to depend on Russian uranium and enrichment technology, when a fully domestic fuel source can be found here in Wyoming and manufactured in the United States.”",
            "UEC President & CEO Amir Adnani welcomed the prospect of providing the uranium needed to operate the Wyoming Natrium reactor. “In these geopolitically complex times, UEC’s vision is to be the leading provider of conflict-free, American uranium for the existing, as well as the new reactors that will come online.”",
            "UEC’s Wyoming production platform includes a portfolio of over 20 uranium projects, that in total contain the largest S-K 1300 compliant resource base in the United States. Four of the projects in the Powder River Basin are fully permitted for in-situ recovery (ISR) production including the Irigaray Central Processing Plant and Christensen Ranch ISR facilities in Johnson County, Wyoming where UEC’s initial production will be focused.",
            "In August, Terrapower selected four suppliers to support its Natrium Reactor Demonstration Project saying the contracts will help to establish key elements of the supply chain that the advanced reactor industry will require as new reactors are brought to market. In July Terrapower and US Centrus agreed to collaborate to ensure the demonstration reactor has access to HALEU to ensure that the project’s 2030 operation date can be met.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under theARDP, including two planned demonstration reactors – Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors. TerraPower and Centrus have been working together since 2021 to help expedite the commercialisation of domestic enrichment technology at Centrus’s Piketon, Ohio, facility.",
            "In December 2022, TerraPower said it expected operation of the Natrium demonstration reactor to be delayed by at least two years from 2028 to 2030 because of the lack of commercial capacity to HALEU in time to meet the proposed targets “We had a plan. It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first core load of fuel come from Russia,” Terrapower said at the time.",
            "However, even if sufficient HALEU is available, the 2030 target date may be optimistic. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. DOE in July 2022 issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory. If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades.",

        "text": [
            "A recent statement from Fitch Ratings casts doubt on any new nuclear construction in the US in the immediate future. Similar concerns were voiced during discussions at a full committee hearing of the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources to Examine Opportunities and Challenges Associated with Advanced Nuclear Reactor Commercialisation.",
            "Fitch noted that without “broader joint action, improved cost competitiveness and/or greater certainty of cost and delivery, most US public power systems are unlikely to pursue new nuclear construction over the next few years, and those that do face the risk of weakened credit quality”.",
            "The recent announcement by the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) and NuScale Power to terminate their Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) illustrates the challenges facing public power systems as they consider new nuclear construction, Fitch said. “The project was unable to attract interest from enough purchasers to continue development, despite the plant's modular design, improved safety measures and the offer of low-cost government funding, likely due to schedule delays and cost concerns.”",
            "Interest in new nuclear generation “should remain piqued as a result of proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules to limit carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants, as well as widening concerns about the effects of climate change and more aggressive carbon-free energy standards”. However, “until the cost of new construction can be assured through insurance or guarantees provided by the US government or highly creditworthy entities, widespread ownership agreements can broadly distribute and limit project exposure, and new design construction is proven to be both feasible and replicable, these risks will remain formidable barriers to participation”.",
            "Fitch noted that nuclear projects “are large, costly and complex, and developers have a historically poor record of completing new projects on time and within budget”. The agency cited the projects launched at the Summer and Vogtle nuclear stations in 2013 that were “plagued by scheduling delays, fabrication challenges, labour shortages and significant cost overruns almost from the beginning of construction”. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) completed its Watts Bar unit 2 in 2016 after work was suspended in 1985 and resumed in 2007, Fitch said. “However, the final cost was roughly $2bn higher than initially planned.” It was only the operational breadth and financial strength of TVA allowed that the utility to absorb the costs and maintain its then current ratings.",
            "Meanwhile, the US Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee hearing chaired by Joe Manchin discussed opportunities for advanced nuclear considering federal support from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, commercialisation challenges and the need to onshore nuclear energy supply chains.",
            "The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided $2.4bn to support competitive Department of Energy (DOE) awards for advanced reactor demonstration projects at commercial scale. The IRA provided ten years of certainty to commercialise advanced reactors through a 30% investment tax credit or $25/MWh production tax credit for new nuclear plants, along with making tens of billions of dollars in loan guarantees available for nuclear projects, said Chairman Manchin, opening the hearing. “The IRA incentives were not just about building power plants, but also securing our nuclear supply chain. Congress provided $700m for High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU), which is the fuel that most advanced nuclear technologies need, including Pele, Terrapower, and X-Energy.”",
            "However, “despite all of the federal and private sector support, we’re witnessing struggles and hesitancy in getting advanced nuclear projects off the ground”, he said. There are large design, cost, and regulatory uncertainties associated with first-of-a-kind nuclear technology, he added, which is why numerous federal programmes were put in place to help reduce these risks. “But someone will need to go first, and unfortunately many of the utilities I’ve spoken with won’t get in the game until others have done it first. We also must continue to ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent judiciously and we’re managing risks – and learning from instances like the NuScale project with UAMPS, which fell far short of our expectations.”",
            "Manchin also commented on the need to offset China and Russia’s growing influence on international nuclear energy development. “We must push back and they cannot succeed. To regain our civil nuclear leadership, we need to demonstrate domestically that we can develop and deploy the next generation of nuclear energy to attract our international partners. We also need to export these technologies to our allies and partners to help reduce their energy dependence on foreign adversaries.”",
            "He also discussed Russia’s dominance over the nuclear fuel supply chain. “Currently, Russia is the only commercial supplier of HALEU, the fuel used for our DOD [Defence Department] micro-reactor project, DOE Advanced Reactor Demonstration Projects, and many other advanced nuclear technologies.” The bipartisan Nuclear Fuel Security Act of 2023 “authorises a DOE programme to onshore US uranium conversion and enrichment capacity, for both traditional and advanced reactors”, said Manchin. “We must re-establish a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain, and our bill will do just that. I’ve also worked … to introduce legislation that would limit and eventually ban uranium fuel imports from Russia. Today, I’m calling on my Congressional colleagues to include these critical nuclear fuel bills and associated funding in the defence and appropriations packages we’re currently negotiating.”",
            "The committee heard witnesses from the Idaho National Laboratory (INL), Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) at the Office of the Secretary of Defence, Dow chemical company and the US Nuclear Industry Council.",
            "Dr John C Wagner, Laboratory Director at INL described the various projects underway. These included MARVEL, an 85 kW DOE test reactor; Pele, a partnership with DOD and BWXT that will utilise TRi-structural ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel. INL, working with Southern Company and TerraPower also plans to conduct the Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment (MCRE), which “will become the world’s first fast spectrum salt reactor experiment to achieve criticality”. These first three systems will be authorised for operation under DOE authority, as opposed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing. The first planned NRC-licensed reactor on the INL site is the Oklo Aurora microreactor in 2027. INL intends to use existing reactor facilities as test beds for reactor demonstrations via the National Reactor Innovation Center (NRIC) to streamline testing, demonstration, and, ultimately, deployment of advanced reactors into the market.",
            "“We are making steady progress, said Wagner. “But we cannot rest easy, as the recent ending of the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) Carbon Free Power Project shows. The era of constructing paper reactors must end. We have to identify our challenges, address, and overcome them. We need to accelerate the systems and build the supply chains needed to rapidly develop and deploy advanced technologies at scale, in our nation and around the world. The project did not end because of technical flaws [but] was suspended because of economics.”",
            "He added: “We cannot abdicate our world leadership in nuclear energy development and deployment. When we build new systems – and export our technologies, materials, and services – we also export our values. A nuclear power plant is designed to operate for six to eight decades. When a country sells a nuclear reactor to another nation, it begins what can be a century-long relationship that encompasses many areas.”",
            "Countries will look for developers who can quickly, safely, affordably, and effectively develop a reactor and get it deployed. “And because U.S. developers are not competing on equal terms, too many of these nations will turn to China, Russia or our friends in South Korea. This presents not just a missed opportunity, but in the case of Russian and Chinese expansion, a danger to US national security.” INL is also working to supply HALEU from DOE-owned materials. “But our lack of domestic fuel cycle capabilities is already hurting efforts to deploy the next generation of technologies needed to allow our commercial fleet to produce 24/7, carbon-free power more than 93% of the time,” Wagner noted.",
            "Optimistic presentations were made by Dr Jeff Waksman SCO Program Manager, about projects being developed by DOD and Edward Stones Vice President, Energy & Climate at Dow about its planned project with X-Energy. However, Jeffrey S Merrifield, a former Commissioner at NRC and Chairman of the Advanced Nuclear Working Group of the US Nuclear Industry Council was more circumspect",
            "He acknowledged that companies such as Dow, Microsoft, Google and Nucor were all considering how nuclear energy to meet their energy needs. These companies share is a large balance sheet and conduct extensive infrastructure design and construction. “Thus, they are not deterred by the additional complexity and patience that comes with the deployment of nuclear power.” However, apart from large state-owned or quasi state-owned utilities, including Ontario Power Generation in Canada and Tennessee Valley Authority other power utilities are hesitant.",
            "“Financial markets and public utility commissions have viewed what is admittedly a tortuous path that it took to get Southern Company’s Vogtle units 3-4 online and the failure of the VC Summer project and have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to repeat that example. Despite the provision of government-backed loan guarantees and other federal tax incentives that are intended to jump start the order process, utility executives … have a variety of built-in incentives for not jumping to the front of the line.",
            "What utilities fear the most is that they will commit to building a first-of-a-kind plant and that there will be financial and timing risk on the back end of the project that could put the utility at economic risk.”",
            "He proposed further support from the federal government and Congress , noting: “As a nation, our skills at building very large infrastructure projects, to put it politely, are ‘rusty’ and we need to have additional investment in university-based engineering programmes.” He added: “Some of the capabilities needed to build new nuclear units either don’t exist or have limited options in the US. While some of these come from friendly nuclear supplier countries such as South Korea and Japan, the vast potential for new nuclear deployment certainly begs the question as to why more of this supply of components can’t be fabricated and built in the US.”",
            "To achieve the economies of scale needed to efficiently and cost effectively manufacture multiple lines of small modular reactors (SMRs), further incentives will be necessary."

            "US-based X-Energy Reactor Company and publicly-traded special purpose acquisition company Ares Acquisition Corporation (AAC), have mutually agreed to terminate their previously announced business combination agreement with immediate effect. Over the course of 2023, X-energy received strong interest from potential investors. However, X-energy and AAC agreed not to proceed with the transaction citing “challenging market conditions, peer-company trading performance and a balancing of the benefits and drawbacks”.",
            "“I am deeply proud of the remarkable business that the X-energy team has built, and I am confident in the company’s future as a global clean energy leader,” said X-energy Founder and Executive Chairman Kam Ghaffarian. “Both X-energy and AAC recognise the challenges presented by the current financial market environment and the opportunity for X-energy to continue forward as a private company. I remain confident in X-energy’s attractive value proposition, and I appreciate the support we have received from AAC and other investors.”",
            "X-energy CEO J Clay Sell team listed the company’s accomplishments in the last year. “We have advanced the initial deployment of four Xe-100 units with Dow on the Texas Gulf Coast, signed a joint development agreement with Energy Northwest for up to 12 Xe-100 units in central Washington, progressed the Xe-100 from basic design to the Final Design Readiness Review phase and signed a cooperative agreements with both the US Department of Defense and US Department of Energy to further advance the development of a mobile microreactor design.”",
            "He continued: “Looking ahead, we will continue to execute against our strategy that capitalises on our proprietary clean energy technology, competitive advantages and strategic relationships to the benefit of our customers and stakeholders around the world.”",
            "David Kaplan, AAC Co-Chairman & CEO, and Co-Founder, Director & Partner of Ares Management Corporation said: “While the persistently volatile public market conditions over the course of 2023 have led to this mutual decision, we remain steadfast in our belief in X-energy’s exceptional talent, differentiated nuclear technology and mission to deliver affordable, zero-carbon energy on a global scale.” An investment vehicle affiliated with Ares Management Corporation has agreed to make a private investment into X-energy in order to support its continued growth as a private company.",
            "Neither party is required to pay the other a termination fee as a result of the mutual decision to terminate the agreement. AAC determined that it will not be able to consummate an initial business combination within the time period required by its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and intends to dissolve and liquidate. AAC anticipates that the last day of trading in the public shares will be 6 November",
            "In December 2022, the business combination had ascribed a pre-money equity value of approximately $2bn to X-energy, the companies said. The transaction was then expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023 subject to approvals. In June, X-energy and AAC updated their agreement that revising X-energy's pre-money equity value sown to $1.8bn. In September, Ares had increased its total investment to $80m through a $50m PIPE investment on top of an initial $30m investment announced in December 2022.",
            "X-energy is developing its Xe-100 pebble bed high-temperature gas reactor design with an output of 200 MWt or 80 MWe using TRISO (tri-structural isotropic) fuel. X-energy says the reactor, optimised as a four-unit plant delivering 320 MWe, can provide baseload power to an electricity system or use its thermal output to support industrial applications with high pressure, high temperature steam.",
            "In January this year, X-energy announced a strategic investment of $25m from South Korea's DL E&C and Doosan Enerbility in a private round of financing to advance the global deployment of the Xe-100.",
            "NuScale Power was the first SMR developer to undergo a business combination to progress commercialisation of its technology. In May 2022, it merged with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp to create the world's first publicly traded SMR technology provider.",
            "However, NuScale is also facing difficulties after a lengthy report by Iceberg Research entitled “Nuscale Power ($SMR): A fake customer and a major contract in peril cast doubt on NuScale’s viability”. Iceberg alleged that NuScale had sold 24 reactors to a “fake customer”. This referenced a deal NuScale announced in October to supply Standard Power with 1,848 MWe of power provided by 24 SMRs to power two US data centre sites. Iceberg predicts Standard Power will be unable to support the contract. NuScale said the Iceberg allegations were “riddled with speculative statements with no basis in fact and demonstrates a limited understanding of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) and the nuclear power industry.”",
            "Iceberg says in a disclaimer: “Our research and reports express our opinions, which we have based upon generally available public information, field research, inferences and deductions through our due diligence and analytical process. To the best of our ability and belief, all information contained herein is accurate and reliable, and has been obtained from public sources we believe to be accurate.”",
            "The Standard Power deal is bigger than NuScale’s other contract, with the government-backed Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) to provide Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) with 462 MWe. Iceberg said NuScale has “around 15 months before its cash runs out” and that the UAMPS contract is reaching a crucial stage. Overall shares in NuScale have fallen around 75% since their peak in late 2022, from around $14 to around $3.5.",
            "NuScale said it “will not engage in a point-by-point rebuttal of every falsehood” but added that is important to set the record straight on some key points. “We are proud that developers and customers are selecting NuScale SMRs as their technology of choice to power their projects and meet their carbon-free energy objectives.”",
            "NuScale says: “Standard Power conducted a comprehensive review of baseload, reliable and secure power sources that are the most critical component for operating data centres in the AI-sector. That comprehensive and independent study led Standard Power to select NuScale’s SMRs as the technology of choice for its power facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania.” NuScale said it has analysed Standard Power’s extensive data room “and is confident that our power modules are appropriate for the selected sites”. It added that Standard Power has already begun site preparation.",
            "NuScale expects customer agreements to drive revenue next year. “NuScale generates cash and revenue from three sources: the sale and delivery of NuScale Power Modules, licensing support, and services provided. NuScale has already generated income from services for our committed customers and we expect our customer agreements to generate additional revenue in 2024.”",
            "NuScale says it has $197m in total cash and no debt as of 30 September. “The Company’s customer agreements will continue to drive NuScale towards cash flow profitability and our healthy balance sheet enables access to sources of capital as needed.”",
            "With respect to the CFPP project, NuScale says it has its own project challenges “not attributable to NuScale’s SMR technology”. It adds: “The work we have completed to date has advanced our nuclear power modules to the point that utilities, governments and industrials can rely on a proven SMR technology that has regulatory approval, is in active production and is ready for commercial deployment.”",
            "\"NuScale’s Senior Leadership and Board of Directors stand firmly behind the strength of our business,\" said John Hopkins, NuScale President and CEO. \"Not only do we have a solid, debt-free balance sheet and a talented and dedicated team, but we are years ahead of the global competition as the only SMR technology provider and producer with US regulatory approval and that is ready for commercial deployment. We are confident in our position to drive the global energy transition and we look forward to continuing to lead.\""

The agreement, awarded through the DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy, supports continuing work on architecture and key technologies for the preliminary design of X-energy’s transportable nuclear plant.",
            "X-energy says its transportable microreactor is designed to generate in the range of 3-5MWe and should be cost-competitive with remote diesel power. X-energy will initiate pre-licensing engagement with the NRC, in order to enable a broad range of deployment possibilities to decarbonise off-grid, remote, or small-scale grid resiliency needs.",
            "“We are grateful for the DOE’s continued support and plan to use this latest award, totalling approximately $2.5m, to continue advancing our mobile microreactor beyond technical feasibility to commercial reality,” said Georgette Alexander-Morrison, X-energy’s Vice-President of Government Programs. “This DOE award underscores our role as a leading microreactor developer. We intend to build on our expertise in next-generation nuclear reactor and fuel design, transportable nuclear systems, and small nuclear solutions for space to create a clean and practical microreactor to be competitive with fossil fuel-based power generation used today for commercial and government agency applications.”",
            "In 2020, the Department of Defense’s (DOD’s) Strategic Capabilities Office selected X-energy, as part of its Project Pele initiative, to design a prototype mobile microreactor capable of producing 1-5 MWe to support mission-critical operations in remote military locations. The DOD in September expanded its agreement with X-energy to develop a cost-effective design for a transportable advanced nuclear microreactor prototype for use in remote military locations or other strategic missions.",

            "The Xe-100 HTGR design has a thermal output of 200 MWt or an electrical output of 80 MWe. It was one of two designs selected by DOE in 2020 to receive $80m each of initial cost-shared funding to build an advanced reactor demonstration plant that can be operational within seven years. The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa. It will use TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprising three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The Xe-100 is designed to operate as a standard 320 MWe plant with four units of 80 MWe but will be scalable to meet demand. Producing 200 MWt of 565°C steam, the Xe-100 is also suitable for other power applications including mining and heavy industry.",
            "X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK. In 2022, Cavendish Nuclear signed an MOU with X-energy to act as its deployment partner for HTGRs in the UK. The companies have applied to the UK's Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to support a Generic Design Assessment of the Xe-100 small modular reactor (SMR) and also supply chain development for the first proposed project.",
            "\"The UK's civil nuclear development is part of our business strategy and this MoU is the latest in a line of agreements that we have signed with a number of SMR companies looking to deploy in the UK market,\" said Dominic Ashmore, Head of Strategy & Business Development – Clean Energy at Sheffield Forgemasters.",

        "text": [
            "Canada’s provincial government of Alberta will invest CAD7m ($5.1m) into a study by oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy on how small modular reactors (SMRs) could be used for future oilsands operations. Rebecca Schulz, Alberta’s Minister of Environment & Protected Areas, told a news conference at the World Petroleum Congress in Calgary that this is “just another example of how industry dollars are being reinvested back into industry to support innovation in emissions reduction”.",
            "Schulz, was joined by Justin Riemer, CEO of Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), and Laura Kilcrease, CEO of Alberta Innovates. ERA’s Technology Innovation & Emissions Reduction (TIER) fund is financing the project. According to Cenovus, the study will take several years and cost a total of CAD26m. It will focus on the feasibility of using nuclear power as an energy source to power the steam assisted gravity drainage process (SAGD) at oilsands.",
            "Rhona DelFrari, Chief Sustainability Officer & Executive Vice President of Stakeholder Engagement at Cenovus explained:",
            "“You use steam to inject it deep underground to loosen the oil so that you can pump it up.” Almost all of the emissions created in this type of oil sands facility are from boiling water, she continued. “So you would be eliminating the emissions because you’re eliminating the burning of natural gas to oil, the water to create the steam.”",
            "However, she clarified that this would only eliminate emissions from operations, not consumption of the end product.",
            "Much of Canada’s anticipated future oil production is expected to come from SAGD. The process currently uses large quantities of natural gas, available in situ, which produces considerable carbon dioxide emissions. Additional applications of nuclear power could include energy for oil sands operations generally speaking, as well as creating hydrogen from natural gas to then upgrade bitumen into synthetic crude, also known as syncrude.",
            "The Cenovus study will build on an early-stage feasibility study prepared by Hatch Ltd for Alberta Innovates, Cenovus and TC Energy and published in August. This looked at the use of SMRs in steam-assisted gravity drainage operations in oilsands",
            "In 2021 Alberta joined New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan in signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to collaborate on SMR development. Alberta has since signed MOUs with several SMR developers including ARC Clean Technology, X-Energy and the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute.",
            "Schulz noted: \"A few years ago, the idea of expanding nuclear energy use was on the back burner – that is no longer the case. In Alberta, small modular nuclear reactors have the potential to supply heat and power to the oil sands, simultaneously reducing emissions and supporting Alberta's energy future. This funding is the foundation for that promising future.\"",
            "ERA CEO Justin Riemer said SMRs have \"great potential\" to supply non-emitting energy in many different applications. He added that more studies are needed to see if the technology is suitable for those industrial applications. “If so, it could be transformational for the in-situ oil sands sector and other sectors in Alberta,\" he said.",
            "The adoption of SMR technology in Alberta – which does not currently have any nuclear generating capacity – would require an extensive regulatory and engagement process, but Shultz said the province is working to ensure the regulatory framework is in place and ready if private industry decides to pursue the technology.",
            "A working group on emissions reductions set up by the government of Alberta and the Canadian federal government has agreed to begin development of a regulatory framework for SMR technology.",
            "According to Warren Mabee, Director of the Institute for Energy & Environmental Policy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, there are still many unknowns with respect to the costs and efficiencies of SMRs but added that linking SMR technology to oilsands production may raise questions about whether it would be better used for other applications. However, he conceded that SMRs could start addressing the very high emissions associated with some oilsands operations. “That's a good starting point, I think,\" he noted.",
            "Environmentalists are not so sure. Greenpeace Canada suggested that the push for SMRs is a \"delay tactic\" from the oil and gas industry. \"Cenovus is one of the wealthiest companies in the country, and they can certainly pay for their own research,\" said Greenpeace Canada spokesperson Keith Stewart. \"The notion that taxpayers are footing the bill for them to promise to do something a decade away from now is a real waste of resources that could be going into putting in solutions like renewable energy.\"",
            "According to Dr Paul Dorfman, chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group and visiting fellow with the Science Policy Research Unit at the University of Sussex in the UK: “Nuclear is the weapon of choice for big oil.” Noting the long lead time to develop and regulate SMRs, they may be advantageous to the oil industry, which can continue producing during the extended regulatory and research and development periods.",
            "A similar sentiment was expressed by Julia Levin, Associate Director of National Climate at Canada’s Environmental Defence organisation. “This is another public handout from the Government of Alberta to an extremely profitable company,” she said. “SMRs appeal to oil and gas companies as a way to delay the energy transition, given how speculative the technology is.”",

In April 2022 DOD’s Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) formally released a record of decision (ROD) to proceed with the programme specifying a high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) mobile microreactor able to produce 1-5 MWe for more than three years without refuelling.",
            "SCO considered two designs selected in a preliminary design competition – an HTGR design from BWX Technologies (BWXT) Advanced Technologies and X-energy’s Mobile Nuclear Power Plant. In June 2022 BWXT’s microreactor was selected for development. The design was for a HTGR fuelled by TRISO (TRIstructural-ISOtropic) high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) transportable in commercially available shipping containers. The prototype is expected to be completed in 2024 for operation in 2025, SCO Programme Manager Jeff Waksman told an American Nuclear Society webinar in August.",
            "“We are now ordering hardware, we are making fuel, we are forging the containment vessel, we’re making moderator blocks … we are no longer a paper reactor, an academic reactor, we are now becoming very real,” he said. By early 2025, the reactor is expected to be shipped to Idaho National Laboratory (INL) where it will be fuelled and shipped to a desert location for initial testing before undergoing a final operational readiness review. Testing and operation of the prototype reactor will be regulated by the DOE rather than the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).",
            "Reactor fuel for Project Pele is to be produced from DOE highly enriched uranium (HEU) currently stored at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee . The fuel will be converted from a metal to an oxide at BWXT’s Nuclear Fuel Services facility in Erwin, Tennessee, and then down-blended to HALEU and fabricated into TRISO reactor fuel at the BWXT facility in Lynchburg, Virginia.",
            "According to Wakeman, the idea for the SCO-led project originated at US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in Hawaii, which is reflected in the project’s name. Pele is “a backronym for ‘Portable Energy for Lasting Effects,’ but no one uses the backronym. Pele is really just named after the Hawaiian goddess of fire and power,” he said.",
            "X-energy President Harlan Bowers, who led the project team during the initial phase of work said: “We learned a tremendous amount while working through the first phase of Project Pele with subject matter experts at the Department of Defense. We intend to build on the knowledge and experience … to create a clean, practical, and cost-effective microreactor to be competitive with fossil fuel-based power generation used today. We expect this next phase of work to include the refining of our design, prototype testing, and initiation of reviews with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure our microreactor meets safety standards and can be licensed for civilian use in the US.”",
            "The DOD estimates that it uses approximately 30 TWh of electricity a year and more than 10m gallons of fuel a day. These figures are expected to increase due to anticipated electrification of the vehicle fleet and maturation of future energy-intensive capabilities. Small, transportable nuclear reactors are expected to help address this growing demand while supporting “mission-critical operations” in remote and austere environments.",
            "Under the expanded contract, X-energy expects to provide DOD with two microreactor designs through Project Pele, while also providing a commercial pathway for the adoption of microreactor technology in other applications. X-energy’s transportable microreactor is designed to generate in the range of 3-5MWe and should be cost-competitive with remote diesel power. X-energy will initiate pre-licensing engagement with the NRC, in order to enable a broad range of deployment possibilities to decarbonise off-grid, remote, or small-scale grid resiliency needs. Although X-energy has not provided details of its Project Pele design, in 2020 it revealed it was working on a Xe-Mobile power generation system which will use X-energy’s proprietary TRISO-X fuel.",
            "Project Pele programme manager Dr Jeff Waksman said that, due to their extraordinary energy density, nuclear reactors have the potential to serve multiple critical functions for meeting resiliency needs in contested logistical environments. “By developing two unique designs, we will provide the Services with a broad range of options as they consider potential uses of nuclear power for both installation and operational energy applications in the near future,” he noted.",

X-energy President Harlan Bowers says BUMS is “a critical subsystem of our reactors that both ensures we meet our fuel efficiency projections while at the same time safely and reliably operating”. He added that tests of the BUMS prototype are expected to begin in 2024 and construction of the first operational units will start in 2025.",

        "text": [
            "Above: Nuclear power is central to meeting our low-carbon energy needs",
            "“Traditional nuclear is all about the cost overruns and the regulatory regime. It’s a risk problem,” explains Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at Charles River Associates Energy Practice. Considering the need for new nuclear capacity, the emerging roll out of small modular and advanced reactor technologies and the market for private investment those risks remain but given its early stage there are a lot of additional technology risks too. Addressing those risks is vital if nuclear is to attract investment and go on to meet its potential. It’s vital for us too given that nuclear is central if the world is to meet its emissions reduction targets.",
            "“We’ve been working with utilities to think about that question of how do they invest in nuclear, what role do they play and how do they de-risk a project? One idea is this approach of having a champion that can make a market. It could be a developer but more likely it’s going to be either a large utility or an off taker that’s a sizeable off taker,” says Kotak.",
            "She cites recent moves by Dow and X-energy to advance efforts to deploy advanced small modular nuclear reactors at an industrial site under the US DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program. In March, Dow and X-energy signed a joint development agreement to develop a four-unit Xe-100 facility at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites. However, while energy-hungry commercial enterprise is clearly a suitable candidate to champion SMRs and advanced reactors, other interests also have a role to play. “You see governments and utilities playing a bigger role in that de-risking process. That could be around the technology, it could be around having the right off-take agreement in place, it could be about having the licensing process streamlined, things of that nature,” says Kotak. She refers to places like Poland, the Czech Republic and Canada where governments are stepping in to support development of advanced reactor technologies. However, when considering SMRs and advanced reactors one element of the technology risk concerns the multitude of different designs that are currently being mooted. “There are over 80 different technologies being bandied about. Some of them won’t make it past the design stage and some will go all the way through and become major businesses. It’s understanding which ones will make it through which ones won’t,” adds Kotak.",
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has deployed a Small Modular Reactor dashboard which includes an analysis of 21 SMR designs and the progress towards their deployment and commercialisation. The dashboard looks beyond technology readiness level and assesses progress across six additional conditions including licensing readiness, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement and fuel. CRA offers a similar readiness dashboard, the S mark, which also supports de-risking of SMRs and advanced reactor technologies. “We looked at the full spectrum of risk from technology to supply chain to licensing to TRLs and so forth and we filter down to the top 15 or 20 technologies that are the most promising across the world in terms of an investment perspective,” explains Kotak.",
            "Taking a lead on investment",
            "While external influences like government and industry clearly have a major role to play in de-risking investment, Kotak argues that the industry itself can do more too. “Looking generally across the nuclear sector we think the different players within the industry can have their own role to attract more investment. Looking from an operator perspective, they have a lot of experience in traditional nuclear but they can leverage those learnings across other nuclear technologies even though there are different construction timelines, and different sorts of risks associated with advanced reactors there are also a lot of synergies. That reduces those risks up front, mitigating the construction risk for example or lessening the construction time, which of course is more palatable from an investment perspective.”",
            "Furthermore, Kotak says, operators can also optimise their existing customer relationships by identifying those that could benefit from, for example, process heat on existing sites: “Thinking slightly outside the box can move forward the discussion on how investment can be attracted by reducing those upfront costs and risks which traditionally have been the stumbling blocks to getting investment.”",
            "“I think that’s really the how this champion concept is a future way of being able to de-risk but also attract more investment because it enables the OEM, such as GE Hitachi, to have that operator-developer-customer lens all in one. Knowing what those connection points are is how a lot of the problems that we’re seeing with large-scale capital and infrastructure intensive projects is howe the process can be simplified to reduce cost,” she adds.",
            "Kotak also references the role of the government in supporting additional investment: “The final player that we see within the nuclear sector and having a known role in attracting more investment would be government bodies.”",
            "However, even where governments are encouraging investment some reform is needed to ensure that technologies and designs can not only keep up with the pace that’s needed for nuclear to remain a key part of the transition, but also for investors to recognise that there is state or central government backing and that their investment in that is also considered.",
            "“That’s something that we have seen work well in countries where private investment has been stimulated because of central government backing and funding, for example with Poland and its nascent nuclear market. They’ve got a lot of private investment now because of government steps to reduce the complexity of regulation, enable commercial frameworks, sign binding relationships with established players. Looking at it from the regulatory perspective is also helpful when thinking about how we can encourage more investment. The current regulatory process is very drawn out and it’s not conducive to attracting investment,” says Kotak.",
            "Furthermore, Kotak contends that there is ample evidence of an industry champion being key to a successful investment and development strategy for nuclear. “When we look at the success stories it really is where you see these partnerships and champions. In Canada, GE HItachi are closely working with OPG and the government, almost as a partner rather than a vendor, which you also see a lot in the US. Some of the troubles that some of the developers are having is because they’re on their own in some ways. They’re fighting the government and the off takers over costs and things of that nature, rather than working together,” says Kotak, adding: “Launching new technology, the vendor has traditionally taken on a lot of the risk of early units in close partnership with the customer and the off-taker to make those projects happen.”",
            "Getting government on board",
            "A major investment risk for nuclear projects is the regulatory environment. As Kotak says: “Nuclear faces so much more scrutiny than any other technology. These regulatory processes are looking for 100% safety and that’s not just very costly, but adds complexity because if one government asks for one thing, another government will ask for that thing plus something else. So instead of having standard requirements when you have more than one regulatory agency in the picture it is actually worse because then you have the worst of both.”",
            "She argues that having government investment, not necessarily in terms of money, but in terms of leadership, is key to addressing those kinds of investor concerns:",
            "“If we think about the three buckets of risk in construction, having more than a verbal promise and an actual investment mitigates that first step in terms of the design development and the licensing. Certification is part of the process that isn’t actually anything to do with the commercialisation or the deployment of the reactor. It actually distracts from what is needed and I think it’s getting it to the point where they [governments] have a stake in the ground as well. if we are going to actually see nuclear getting to the heights that it has the potential to, these localised regulatory hurdles do need to be mitigated and perhaps there is some benefit in looking at how other industries have been able to do that, like aviation. Leveraging learnings from other industries that might deal with some of the same complexities or risks and are also global is another way of looking at how players can actually progress and not impede progress,” says Kotak.",
            "A strong message for governments looking at expanding nuclear capacity would be to deliver the same regulatory coherence which exists in aviation and which is conspicuously missing from the advanced and SMR sector. “There’s probably some technology consolidation that needs to take place too,” notes Kotek. “There’s just too many different designs and that adds complexity too. The regulator has to examine 80 different technologies and they all have different approaches. This is a nightmare and having fewer technologies is probably something that’s going to need to take place as well.”",
            "“In the beginning of the nuclear build out people talked about electricity being too cheap to meter. They said that because it was actually really cheap,” says Kotek. Certainly there are ractors built in the 1970s and 1980s that are still running and for a fraction of the cost of just about any other form of electricity generation that is available today.",
            "Kotek continues: “They’re really reliable, safe and they’ve been running for 50 years or more. We somehow lost track of that and the rise of all the clean energy sources like wind and solar have now created a stronghold. Actually though, when you look at the sustainability advantage of nuclear it is more favourable, yet we’ve added in these complexities and these layerings that are inhibiting its development. We are not only making it more expensive but actually we’re missing out some key sustainability advantages as well,” says Kotek.",
            "Nonetheless, considering what is actually required to meet the 2°C scenario from the Paris agreement, the amount of solar, wind, batteries and EVs and the associated nickel, copper and lithium materials that are needed and all the mines that need to be developed too it is clear that nuclear must be part fo the solution.",
            "“If you look at where things are today and where they need to be in 10 years we’re just nowhere near. So there’s going to be a reckoning at some point. Nuclear is potentially a backfill for some of the challenges that we’re going to see in the medium term on the renewables front. We haven’t really hit it yet but we’re starting to feel it in the EV world where the battery supply chain issues are real and it’s around the materials supply chain.",
            "There is going to be a more pressing overall drive for alternative technologies and we really mean nuclear if we mean low carbon,” says Kotek. She adds: “It’s not to pit nuclear against renewables. It’s more that renewables may not be able to get there in time because of the mining issues. Again, it’s a risk management issue given the obvious resource risk for renewables. If you were an investor and considered the technical risk of choosing one technology over another maybe they’re not considering there are other perhaps pressing risks that are associated with other technologies,” says Kotek.",
            "Considering the complexity and the sheer volume of different technologies it’s very difficult to unpack all the issues and to see across the value chain where the pain points are. However, Kotek argues that a lot of activity in the small and advanced nuclear sector reflects this realisation that nuclear is going to be needed to transition to a low carbon energy scenario. “My personal view is that nuclear has to play a part and there’s no way around it,” she says.",
            "Turning to the messaging for investors about how to address some of these risks, she emphasises the commercial risks and ways to mitigate those risks by, for example, having a champion who would partner with developers to provide a ready market but also work with them in the development process and ease that process to reduce the construction development risks, but she also highlights the role that investors themselves can play: “This is all from the perspective of what investors need to feel more comfortable with making a large investment in nuclear. But investors can also have a voice to rally behind these points. A lot of trends that we were starting to see are because of the Russia-Ukraine war in terms of increased policy support like the US Inflation Reduction Act. So, the foundations are there for investment and now maybe it’s also on the investors to say what do they need to be able to make a comfortable decision. They need that de-risk and more of these tangible measures like having the regulatory licensing process paid for, but I think it’s also a point for them as well to shout a little bit as to what is needed to de-risk.”",
            "Her key message: “An advanced nuclear rollout is not a ‘nice to have’ it’s a ‘must-have’ if we’re going to have an energy transition that works in any time line that makes sense for climate. There’s a real need for this and investors should think about that and ultimately how the scale of this is going to increase.”"

            "The small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses. (Credit: Wim van ‘t Einde on Unsplash)",
            "The nuclear industry hopes that small modular reactors (SMRs) will become familiar workhorses of the energy system; supplied as a package, delivered in modules that can be quickly and easily assembled on-site and providing heat or power to neighbouring customers or to the grid as a whole.",
            "In theory, using a small modular technology that is quickly rolled out in numbers allows the supply chain to make efficiencies, builds operating experience for owners and investors alike and drives the technology down the “cost curve”. That process has become familiar in the energy industry as wind turbines, solar PV and batteries have been rolled out in numbers that have risen from a few hundred units to become a mainstay of the energy industry in less than two decades. In fact the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) noted in its March report that between 2010 and 2019 “sustained decreases” saw unit costs fall by 85% for solar PV, by 55% for wind power and by 85% for lithium ion batteries. That came with deployment at the end of the period 10 times that at the start for solar PV.",
            "Can nuclear SMRs follow the same route? Or has the industry’s current scattergun approach limited its opportunity to follow other clean energy technologies down the cost curve?",
            "There are several consistent aspects to technologies that have successfully negotiated the curve. They are (initially) small; a single familiar technology has been used; it has been rolled out in numbers; they can be accommodated on a variety of sites; experience of the first projects has been quickly absorbed; and that data has given third party financiers confidence to invest in follow-on projects. Lithium ion batteries, for example, are being rolled out at gigawatt scale, yet the largest installations, housed in facilities very like shipping containers, contain arrays of familiar small batteries. Innovation has been required in operating them as a mass array, integrating them with the grid, developing markets for the services they can offer (response, rather than baseload power) and modelling and managing the best operating regimes. Now there is ‘market pull’ as electricity system operators value the services they can provide.",
            "SMRs are still at the ‘market push’ stage. The International Nuclear Energy Agency (IAEA) says it is aware of more than 80 designs that have been mooted, but its Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS) lists 48 reactor designs in the SMR category that are at some point in the design phase. In fact, nearly a dozen of those actually fall outside IAEA’s own SMR definition, which puts an upper limit of 300 MWe on the reactor rating and the 300 MWe designation also means some of the more elderly conventional designs, such as India’s PHWR, are included in IAEA SMR listings.",
            "The IAEA’s ARIS list has seven distinct types of technology at an early or late stage of design, with designs varying within each class. A dozen are versions of light water reactors that might be considered closest to the PWRs and BWRs that currently form the majority of working reactors. Seven are based around lead coolant, nine around sodium coolant and five around lead bismuth coolant. Six have helium coolant and five are based around fluoride and graphite. Two combine a graphite moderator with a molten salt coolant.",
            "Reducing costs by replication requires ‘learning by doing’ – ie building the reactors. That requires several issues to fall into place: a well-understood design, ideally with an operating track record, and a pipeline of sites that gives the supply chain confidence to invest. Where has the SMR industry reached in that process?",
            "An SMR barrier that is not faced by many other types of electricity generation is the nuclear licence. This requires both a licence for the technology and for the site and it is a bottleneck that each technology has to pass through. The first to do so was NuScale, which won design approval for the six-module VOYGR variant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January this year. However, design approval for the technology does not necessarily mean it can be installed at a chosen site. The US NRC approval for NuScale allows a utility or other operator to reference the design, but the operator has still has to apply for a combined licence to build and operate it as a nuclear power plant anywhere in the USA.",
            "Likely to be the next to receive design approval is the GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300, which “leverages the design and licensing basis” of GEH’s US NRC-certified ESBWR. It was entered into the US NRC licensing process in 2020. BWRX-300 has already completed phases one and two of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s (CNSC) vendor design review process and in December 2022 GEH announced that it has submitted it into the UK’s Generic Design Assessment (GDA).",
            "The UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) also last year took on GDA of a new reactor from the UK’s Rolls Royce SMR. The reactor is described as an SMR by the company, although at 440 MWe it is considerably above the IAEA’s upper limit to meet that definition.",
            "All three of these designs are based on well-known nuclear technology that has been deployed and has a track record of operation. Although the SMR version has numerous differences, these designs are likely to have the familiarity needed for mass rollout.",
            "What has been the progress towards choosing sites for the potential SMR fleet?",
            "In contrast to large nuclear units, which are necessarily much more influenced by site characteristics, the key requirement for SMRs is replication. That means the site should be able to host several units or there should be a large number of potential sites available. It is no surprise that the technologies that have passed furthest through the design licensing process have a head start when naming sites for deployment.",
            "NuScale’s progress through the licensing process has given it a strong position in raising potential buyer interest. It is selling its 77 MWe NuScale plant in three, six or 12 unit versions branded as ‘VOYGRTM’ and it is working with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) on a combined licence application for a six-module plant to be sited at the Idaho National Laboratory.",
            "The application will be submitted to the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) next year and is targeting units to start up in 2029 and 2030. The UAMPS consortium recently reapproved the project despite cost increases. UAMPS said a new budget plan “will move the small modular nuclear reactor project into an aggressive 2023 workplan, which focuses on completing the preparation of the application to construct and operate the plant, to be submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in January 2024.” This year it will also procure long lead material – NuScale Power has already placed an upper reactor pressure vessel order with Doosan Enerbility – and will develop a more detailed construction estimate.",
            "NuScale has signed agreements with two other utilities that could open the door to more deployment. They are via Dairyland Power (which serves Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois) and Associated Electric Cooperative Inc (which serves 2 million people in Missouri).",
            "In addition, NuScale Power has also unveiled a large number of Memoranda of Understanding with potential site owners in other countries. The most advanced is Romania’s RoPower Nuclear, which is owned equally by S.N. Nuclearelectrica and Nova Power & Gas, and which signed a contract with NuScale Power for front-end engineering and design (FEED) work in December. Phase 1 of the FEED work awarded to NuScale will define the major site and specific inputs for a VOYGR-6 plant to be deployed at the Doicesti power station. Importantly, Doicesti was not previously a nuclear site and instead has small coal-fired generation units.",
            "Similarly, in Poland, NuScale now has agreements with companies in which it is providing ‘support’ as they investigate deploying VOYGR at sites that have not hosted nuclear technology in the past. One is a joint venture of Unimot (which offers Polish wholesale and retail customers fuel products, gas and electricity) and Getka (a US energy company) and the other is KGHM, a Polish metals extraction company and a large industrial energy user. KGHM has already begun discussions with the National Atomic Energy Agency (NAEA) and has signed an early works agreement with NuScale.",
            "NuScale can also point to Memoranda of Understanding in Europe with Bulgaria, Ukraine and Czechia. Outside Europe it has similar agreements in Jordan and Kazakhstan. All, of course, require the reactor to be licensed.",
            "Also securing potential customers is GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy’s BWRX-300 SMR. It secured its first site last year when Ontario Power Generation selected it for deployment at Darlington. OPG aims to complete the first commercial construction at the site in 2028. Notably, GEH has signed project delivery agreements with SNC-Lavalin and Aecon for that project. Design acceptance by CNSC will give a head start for a second deployment by SaskPower which has selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Saskatchewan, although that is timed for the mid-2030s.",
            "This year GEH also announced that Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has begun planning and preliminary licensing for potential deployment of a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site in Tennessee.",
            "The regulatory approval process has been kicked off in Poland, where Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) and its partners have submitted an application to Poland’s National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300. OSGE says it wants to deploy “at least 10” BWRX-300s with the first in operation by the end of this decade. In addition, Fermi Energia announced that it had selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Estonia.",
            "Rolls Royce has not yet secured a site in its home market for its SMR. It believes the reactor will be of interest for so-called ‘industrial clusters’, areas which the UK has given a particular focus for decarbonisation. Government funding for the industrial clusters has been directed towards development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) or hydrogen production, rather than opening the sites for new nuclear. The new nuclear option is currently restricted to specific sites in England and Wales (Scotland has a moratorium on new nuclear) identified when the government decided to restart nuclear build 20 years ago. In the end the sites identified were previous nuclear sites. Planning law reform currently under way should widen that pool of sites but, currently, industrial sites would require special permission from government. However, Rolls Royce has also found willing partners in Poland. The state- owned Industria business, a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Agency JSC, has selected the Rolls-Royce SMR for the Central Hydrogen Cluster, with plans to produce 50,000 tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen each year. It wants up to three units and Rolls-Royce SMR said that may open the door to “opportunities to replace more than 8 GW of coal-fired power plants in southern Poland with SMRs throughout the 2030s”.",
            "NuScale, GEH and Rolls Royce have sought design approval first and built customer numbers as the reactor advances through the process. But X-Energy may undertake the process in partnership.",
            "X-Energy is part of the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) and will receive $1.2bn in cost shared funding from DOE over the life of the ARDP effort. Now it has signed a joint development agreement (JDA) with US chemicals conglomerate Dow to use X-Energy’s Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactor for process heat and electricity. The JDA scope includes the preparation and submission of a Construction Permit application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). X-energy is said to be preparing to submit a license application to the NRC.",
            "They plan to build X-Energy’s first unit at a Dow industrial site – one of several the company has along the gulf coast in Louisiana and Texas. A site is expected to be chosen by the end of this year.",
            "Dow represents a fleet deployment opportunity in itself – it operates manufacturing sites in 31 countries where the Xe-100 could be used to decarbonise operations. It may join forces with X-Energy to license the technology to other industrial customers as well as to power utilities. X-Energy had previously been in discussion with Energy Northwest and Grant County in Washington state, which would now have follow-on units.",
            "Clearly, the Polish market will be a kick-starter for the industry. That presents its own risks: the European market for new and existing nuclear is made more problematic because some of Poland’s fellow EU members are opposed to any type of nuclear power and will object to it. Equally, however, EU members would like to see Poland able to close its coal industry and clean up its energy industry as a whole and that may benefit SMRs.",
            "What about the large number of other technologies competing to roll out? It is likely that their opportunity will come after mass deployment of the leading options have created market ‘pull’. If the model of a small-scale reactor that is used on an industrial site is familiar to investors and to the public, it lowers those risks to deployment and can allow a new technology to be presented to an investor comfortable with accepting risk.",
            "Again, the battery market is instructive. Mass deployment of lithium ion batteries has developed both the supply chain for delivery and installation and the skill set for making returns for investors. Now the ‘market pull’ is there, attention has turned to the next technology. A recent analysis from Bloomberg New Energy Finance says “sodium ion batteries are more expensive than lithium ion today because of low volumes and underdeveloped supply chains. But BNEF sees potential for material savings and energy-density improvements that would provide a viable pathway for sodium ion cells to cost half what lithium iron phosphate does today”.",
            "The nuclear industry is grappling with deploying SMRs but two or three versions are showing the characteristics that have been successful for other asset classes. The technology is relatively familiar, while the small size of units mean they will be deploying in 10s, rather than singly. The question will be whether that can step up to the hundreds or thousands, to gain the true benefits of replication. That may see promising designs fall by the wayside – but that is an experience familiar across asset classes, when falling costs due to replication overtake a technology that would, on paper, look more economic. In that case experience suggests the broader energy industry and the investment community will “not let the best be the enemy of the good” and take a pragmatic decision: familiarity wins.",
            "Some SMRs are under construction worldwide are based on familiar light water designs, but are not obviously replicable in a ‘series build’ outside their home market.",
            "CAREM in Argentina is a small PWR, rated at 32 MW, intended to take advantage of an indigenous nuclear supply chain – some 70% of the components will come from Argentinian companies. In 2021 the Argentine government announced an effort to complete the reactor within three years, although the project has been in gestation for many years and dates back to the mid- 1980s. A potential follow-on project, planned for Formosa, is not identical as it would be rated at 100 MWe.",
            "China’s Linglong 1 project at Changjiang is also a small-version PWR, rated at 152 MWe and in 2016 it was the first SMR to pass a safety review by the International Atomic Energy Agency. First concrete was poured in mid 2019 and late last year it was reported that equipment installation had begun.",
            "China and Russia have both named follow-up sites for their SMRs. China plans two 200 MW units in Baishan and Russia named Kurchatov in Kazakhstan as an expected home for two 300 MW units.",

            "The director of the Jordan Atomic Energy Commission (JAEC) Khaled Touqan, said, looking forward to the next 10 years, JAEC is considering small reactors. It is looking at various possibilities including designs from Russia, Korea, France, and the UK, trying to determine the optimal technical specifications and how to adapt such reactors to the Jordanian environment, Touqan explained. He noted the potential use of small nuclear reactors for water desalination as well as power production.",
            "In an interview with Russia’s Sputnik, he said: “We have done all the studies. The infrastructure is in place, and studies on site selection and the provision of cooling water are in place. Now we are comparing technologies and we want to get the go-ahead from the government. There is a problem of providing water for cooling and a financing problem, and we are studying these details with all well-known companies, including the Russian ones, in order to choose the best model in Jordanian conditions.”",
            "Touqan said had been decided to use small reactors for water desalination and electricity generation, adding that the use of a floating NPP in Aqaba is being considered, but that may raise concerns among neighbouring countries. He ruled out the possibility that Jordan would be ready to construct a large reactor within the next 10 years, and that the choice of small reactors was justified because of potential water shortages.",
            "Russia and Jordan agreed in 2015 on two atomic reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts each, but in 2018 it was announced that Jordan had abandoned the project. In the same period, the two countries signed an agreement to develop a project to build a low-energy nuclear power unit (about 200 megawatts) in Jordan.",
            "Jordan had intended to have two 1000 MWe nuclear units in operation by 2025 but has now cancelled such plans. However, it had signed multiple nuclear cooperation agreements. The Committee for Nuclear Strategy, set up in 2007, had planned for nuclear power to provide 30% of electricity by 2030, and to provide for exports. In 2008 JAEC investigated plant technologies including AECL’s Candu-6, the Areva-Mitsubishi Atmea 1 and a KHNP design.",
            "In 2009 JAEC contracted Tractabel Engineering for a siting study at Al Amra in Al Mafraq province and signed WorleyParsons for the pre-construction phase of a two-unit plant. In 2013 JAEC decided on two AES-92 units on a build-own-operate basis with Rosatom Overseas. However, in 2018 the project was cancelled on the grounds of cost in favour of small modular reactors, and a new agreement was signed with Rosatom Overseas. A MOU was also signed with Rolls-Royce for an SMR feasibility study, and another with X-energy on its 76MWe Xe-100 HTGR. Talks were held with CNNC in 2018 on the possible construction of a 220MWe HTR-PM reactor for operation from 2025, and in 2019 an agreement was signed with US NuScale.",
            "Jordan has an operating research reactor. In 2009 JAEC selected a consortium headed by the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute with Daewoo to build the 5 MWt Jordan Research & Training Reactor at the Jordan University for Science & Technology at Al Ramtha. The reactor, similar to South Korea's 30 MW Hanaro reactor, uses 19% enriched fuel and has the potential to be upgraded to 10 MWt.

            "The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Government of Alberta to establish a comprehensive cooperation framework to jointly explore the viability of small modular reactor (SMR) technologies to help to meet Alberta’s net-zero targets. The MoU was signed by KAERI President Dr Joo Han-Gyu, Alberta’s Minister of Jobs, Economy & Northern Development Brian Jean, and Minister of Trade, Immigration & Multiculturalism Rajan Sawhney, at a virtual event. It seeks to bolster collaboration on the deployment of SMR technology, including Korea’s System-integrated Modular Advanced ReacTor (SMART).",
            "Alberta is one of four Canadian provinces – the others are New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan – that have agreed to a joint strategic plan outlining their strong support for the path forward on SMRs. Since then, KAERI and Alberta have discussed clean energy cooperation based on KAERI’s SMR technology, particularly SMART. There have also been technical discussions between private sectors, and high-level exchanges, including the visit of Ministers Jean and Sawhney to Korea in February. SMR technology is viewed as having great potential to supply energy to many different industries and applications, including in Alberta’s oilsands.",
            "\"This mutual cooperation agreement was promoted to discuss the issue of applying SMART technology with almost no carbon emissions to supply necessary steam to oil sands (tar sands) mining areas in Alberta,\" KAERI said. \"Based on this agreement, the two sides plan to share in advance the information necessary to confirm the feasibility of SMART construction and further obtain licences.”",
            "Korean companies, including Hyundai Engineering, have already been promoting projects that utilise SMART technologies for Alberta oil sand mining, KAERI noted. “This mutual cooperation agreement is expected to promote the activities of these companies.\"",
            "At the signing ceremony Dr Joo said “it is time to translate the net-zero emission commitment into actions, and SMR technology is crucial in carbon reduction actions”. He added that deployment of SMART in Alberta would pioneer the battle against climate change. Minister Jean noted that the Government of Alberta “is open to exploring all technologies, including SMRs, to help energy production thrive in a low-carbon future”. Through the agreement with KAERI, “we are continuing to explore deploying SMR technology and strengthening Alberta’s position as a world-leading responsible energy producer for years to come”. Minister Sawhney said he was excited about the potential for SMR technologies, such as KAERI’s.",
            "SMART is a 330 MWt pressurised water reactor with integral steam generators and advanced safety features with a 60-year design life and three-year refuelling cycle. The unit is intended to produce electricity (up to 100 MWe) as well as heat for thermal applications, such as seawater desalination. SMART received standard design approval from the Korean regulator in mid-2012 following completion of the basic design, and KAERI had planned to build a demonstration plant to begin operation in 2017. However, further development was delayed, in part because of a lack of orders for an initial reference unit. During their February visit to Korea, Jean and Sawhney visited KAERI's research facilities, including the SMART-ITL and SMART-MCR Simulator.",
            "Jean said: “Alberta is, and always will be, an energy powerhouse. Alberta’s government is committed to actively exploring opportunities to lower emissions while safely powering the world for decades to come. This MoU will allow us to build on the South Korean government’s interest in supporting safe and effective deployment of their SMR technology. It offers an opportunity to leverage new innovations to grow Alberta’s energy economy.”",
            "Invest Alberta, a Crown corporation of the Alberta Government, in March signed an MoU with ARC Clean Technology Canada to jointly pursue activities to support commercialisation of ARC's ARC-100 SMR technology in the province. That followed an MoU signed in January with X-Energy Canada to develop economic opportunities supporting the potential deployment of the Xe-100 SMR. It has also supported SMR developer Terrestrial Energy in its efforts to expand its operations into Alberta.",
            "The MoU with KAERI is effective for three years. Any SMR technology deployed in Alberta must meet Canadian safety requirements and would require an approved design and approved permitting for the reactor installation. SMART is one of only a few modular reactor technologies to have received design approvals from a nuclear regulatory agency."

It is one of two designs selected by the US Department of Energy (DOE) in 2020 to receive $80m each of initial cost-shared funding to build an advanced reactor demonstration plant that can be operational within seven years. The Xe-100 evolved from both the UK’s Dragon reactor at Winfrith in Dorset and the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor project in South Africa.",
            "It will use TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) fuel comprising three layers of carbon and ceramic materials that surround kernels or balls of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.",
            "X-energy, which expects its first reactor to be operational in 2028, recently announced plans to install its first Xe-100 at one of Dow’s US Gulf Coast sites. The first commercial deployment of the Xe-100 had previously been expected to be a four-unit plant near Energy Northwest's Columbia NPP in Washington. Energy Northwest remains committed to deploying an advanced SMR in Washington state by the end of the decade, and that the Xe-100 is its preferred technology. X-energy UK Holdings and Cavendish Nuclear also propose SMRs in the UK.",
            "The Xe-100 will use circulating helium gas to transfer heat from the reactor core through a heat exchanger to generate high-temperature steam that can be used to generate electricity or supply heat for industrial processes. The HTF will test Xe-100 components and instruments under operating conditions and without the presence of any nuclear materials. These tests will enable design verification and give Kinectrics and X-energy performance data on key reactor systems, X-energy said.",
            "Before it was closed down, South Africa’s PebbleBed Modular Reactor programme included a HTF which was under construction next to the SAFARI-1 reactor It included a helium purification facility and heat exchangerand fuel handling system. Construction started in 2004 and its 40 metre high tower was a dominant feature of Pelindaba.",
            "Kinectrics CEO David Harris said the testing provided by the planned HTF will support \"timely commercialisation\" of the Xe-100. \"This project is part of a long-term partnership between X-energy and Kinectrics. We expect the Xe-100 will produce electricity and high temperature process steam in a safe and reliable manner, which enables our clean energy future,\" he said.",
            "X-energy and Kinectrics expect to announce the HTF site this summer and complete its detailed design in 2023, with the goal of having an operational facility in 2025. Working alongside a Kinectrics team, X-energy engineers expect to refine Xe-100 start-up and commissioning procedures using data collected from HTF testing and to gain critical operating experience to inform future reactor maintenance, operations, and staff training.",

        "text": [
            "ARC Clean Technology Canada (ARC) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Invest Alberta Corporation (IAC) for co-operation in the commercialisation in Alberta of ARC’s advanced Small Modular Reactor (aSMR) technology. The province of Alberta, along with New Brunswick, Ontario and Saskatchewan, has agreed to a joint strategic plan to support SMR development.",
            "ARC will begin the process to expand its operations in Alberta with the aim of developing a fleet of ARC-100 reactors. With IAC support, ARC will begin engagement and partnership activities with industry and stakeholders. ARC said it will also develop the associated supply chains and manufacturing, operating and support services necessary for the construction and operation of multiple ARC-100 units.",
            "The ARC-100 was earlier selected in 2018 for deployment at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station (PLNGS) in New Brunswick as part of Canada’s SMR Roadmap, with operation planned for 2029. The ARC-100 design completed the first of three phases of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) Vendor Design Review (VDR) in 2019. Also in 2019, ARC signed an agreement with US-based global infrastructure firm AECOM to continue its development of the ARC-100 technology.",
            "In July 2022, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) entered into a collaboration agreement with ARC, funded through CNL’s Canadian Nuclear Research Initiative (CNRI), for work to advance the fuel development and manufacturing processes to produce fuel for ARC’s technology. The following December, Canada’s Belledune Port Authority also proposed using an ARC aSMR to generate a minimum of 1GW of heat and power for industrial users at the port’s Green Energy Hub. Pending feasibility studies, environmental approvals and CNSC licensing, the project is planned for commercial operation between 2030 and 2035.",
            "The ARC-100 is a 100MWe integrated sodium-cooled fast reactor with a metallic uranium alloy core. The design is based on the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II (EBR-II) fast reactor prototype which operated at the USA's Argonne National Laboratory from 1961 to 1994. ARC Nuclear signed an agreement with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in March 2017 to collaborate on the development and licensing of an SMR using proprietary technology from GEH's PRISM reactor, which is also based on the EBR-II.",
            "However, all fast reactor projects in Europe and North America were essentially abandoned in the 1970a and 1980s and had effectively ceased in Europe and the US by the 1990s. Although interest in fast reactor technology is now reviving in Europe and the USA, both through collaborative projects and government support for private company initiatives, it remains at the design phase. The projected operation dates for the ARC-100 may, therefore, prove to be optimistic. Currently fast reactor development continues apace only in Russia, China and India, where there are now five fast reactors in operation and five more under development.",
            "William Labbe, president & CEO of ARC Clean Technology Canada, said early deployment of the company's SMR technology would bring high quality jobs, significant investment, and economic benefits. \"With Alberta being Canada's energy and heavy industry leader, it is a natural market for ARC's industrial applications and will be a key stepping stone for the global deployment of Canadian SMR technology,\" he said.",
            "IAC CEO Rick Christiaanse believes meaningful partnerships with leading cleantech innovators such as ARC bring \"impactful net-zero solutions\" to the province. He said: \"Momentum is building in Alberta around SMR technology, with Invest Alberta signing MOUs with several companies that are on the path to launching proven sustainable energy supplies in the province.\"",
            "Invest Alberta, a Crown corporation of the Government of Alberta, is also supporting other SMR projects. An MOU was signed with X-Energy Canada to develop economic opportunities supporting the potential deployment of the Xe-100 SMR. IAC has also supported Terrestrial Energy’s plans to expand its operations into Alberta to pursue commercial development of its Integral Molten Salt Reactor plant for industrial cogeneration in western Canada.",

        "text": [
            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has recently published a 73-page study, which tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment. NEA says the SMR designs are at various stages of development, from fundamental research on new concepts to commercial deployment and operation of mature designs.",
            "NEA notes that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found, on average, the pathways for the 1.5 degree C scenario would require installed nuclear capacity to reach 1,160 GWe by 2050, up from 394 GWe in 2020. “While the IPCC nuclear target is ambitious for nuclear energy, it is not beyond reach,” according to NEA. “Recent NEA analysis … finds that this target can be achieved through a combination of the long-term operation of existing plants and building large-scale Generation-III new builds and SMRs. It will also include leveraging both power and non-power applications of nuclear energy, including nuclear heat for industry and district heating, nuclear-based hydrogen and synthetic fuels.”",
            "NEA estimates that by 2050 SMRs could reach 375 GWe of installed capacity in an ambitious case, contributing to more than 50% of this capacity gap. The SMR technology pipeline includes a range of technology readiness levels and regulatory readiness levels. Some technologies are already demonstrated (at lab and commercial scales), while others are still in the R&D stage. NEA says timelines for deployment vary based on technology and regulatory readiness levels, with some designs expected to be demonstrated and commercialised before 2030 with others to follow later in the 2030s.",
            "NEA believes less mature SMRs will also play a role in meeting decarbonisation objectives. SMRs and advanced reactors with high levels of technology and licensing readiness will play a central role in getting to net zero by 2050 by supporting decarbonisation efforts that are expected to gain pace in the 2030s and 2040s. SMRs and advanced reactors with lower levels of technology and licensing readiness could be deployed at scale from the 2040s to supply electricity, heat and hydrogen and would contribute to long-term sustainability of nuclear energy after 2050 when associated with advanced nuclear fuel cycles. The report urges policy support for SMRs with high and low levels of technology and licensing readiness.",

NEA also classifies them according to reactor configurations including 17 land-based designs; five multi-module designs; three marine-based designs; and one mobile design.",
            "NEA notes that SMRs can replace fossil fuels for on-grid power generation, diesel generators for off-grid mining and industrial operations, and fossil fuels for cogeneration of heat and power for heavy industries and district heating. They can also enable large-scale water treatment and desalination to produce clean potable water. “These varied market needs have prompted the development of a range of SMR technologies, which vary in technology, sizes, and configuration.” NEA comments: “Policymakers are often overwhelmed with this great variety as they strive to consider which designs might meet their particular needs and in what time frame.”",
            "It says the NEA SMR Dashboard is designed to help navigate this complex area of technology. It adds that future editions will continue to track the progress of these designs and include additional SMR technologies as verifiable information becomes available and is assessed.",
            "However, missing from the array of information on this selection of widely different SMRs is projected deployment dates. Some of these companies have suggested somewhat optimistic dates for operation of their first units. For example, USNC has suggested 2027 for its MMR, while Kairos (Hermes) has suggested 2026. Terrapower (Natrium), Urenco (U Battery) and X-energy (Xe-100) have all suggested 2028, although Terrapower has since indicated a delay of two years due to problems with fuel development. Leadcold initially suggested 2025 for its SEALER-55 but later amended that to 2030. Others scheduled for the early-mid 2030s include EDF’s Nuward, NuScale’s VOYGR, the Rolls Royce SMR and the Westinghouse eVinci. Meanwhile, Russia’s KLT40S and China’s HTR-PM are already in operation.",
            "Much greater detail is available in the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022. This provides data on SMRs around the world, including detailed descriptions of 83 reactors under development or construction in 18 countries. The 424 pages provide details of the technologies involved while Annex I summarises the information in a series of tables, including deployment timelines. The first booklet in this series was first published in 2014 and serves as a supplement to the IAEA’s Advanced Reactors Information System (ARIS), an online database with comprehensive information on the latest developments in advanced reactors.",
            "IAEA notes in its introduction to the latest edition: “Several major milestones have been reached in SMR technology deployment. The Akademik Lomonosov floating power unit in the Russian Federation with two-module KLT-40S was connected to the grid in December 2019 and started commercial operation in May 2020. The HTR-PM demonstrator in China was connected to the grid in December 2021 and is expected to reach full power operation by the end of 2022. The CAREM25 in Argentina is under construction and is expected to reach first criticality in 2026. The construction of ACP100 in China started in July 2021 and is targeted to start commercial operation by the end of 2026. The construction of BREST-OD-300 in Russian Federation began in June 2021 and is planned to be completed in 2026. The NuScale Power Module in the United States has received Standard Design Approval from US NRC in September 2020. The NRC has directed to issue a final rule that certifies NuScale’s SMR design for use in the United States.”",
            "All the other designs, including those mentioned by NEA, are either in the pre-conceptual/conceptual or basic/detailed design stages. Those still in the conceptual design stage include U Battery, eVinci, Nuward and Sealer-55.",
            "IAEA notes that the technical description and major technical parameters in the booklet “were provided by the design organisations without validation or verification by the IAEA. All figures, illustrations and tables in technical description of each design were also provided by the design organisations.” A similar caveat is given by NEA."

            "“The utilisation of X-energy’s fourth generation nuclear technology will enable Dow to take a major step in reducing our carbon emissions while delivering lower carbon footprint products to our customers and society,” said Dow chairman & CEO Jim Fitterling. “The collaboration with X-energy and the DOE will serve as a leading example of how the industrial sector can safely, effectively and affordably decarbonise.”",

The four-reactor Xe-100 nuclear plant will provide a Dow facility with cost-competitive, low carbon process heat and power to make essential products used by consumers and businesses. X-energy adds that its simplified modular design “is road-shippable and intended to drive scalability, accelerate construction timelines and create more predictable and manageable construction costs”.",

        "text": [
            "Above: A local power range monitoring (LPRM) system measures neutron flux",
            "The emergence of the small modular reactor (SMR) sector is prompting capacity ramp ups across the supply chain as well as new designs for key equipment areas such as neutron detection. Reuter-Stokes, which has been designing and manufacturing neutron detection devices since the 1950s, is embracing these new opportunities.",
            "Rod Martinez, Reuter-Stokes Vice President, says: “in 1986 we became the OEM manufacturer of neutron sensors for boiling water reactors. Since then, we’ve been making neutron detectors for BWRs and PWRs and our company has expanded to not only provide neutron detection but auxiliary equipment. We’ve made the sensors that these companies need. With the emergence of SMR we’re helping these companies that are new names in the industry to design sensors too.”",
            "Reuter-Stokes has already made market in-roads, recently signing a contract with NuScale to design and manufacture unique neutron detectors for the company’s SMR design.",
            "Although currently the NuScale’s is the only SMR with design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Reuter-Stokes is clear in its ambition to become the go-to supplier for neutron detectors right across the SMR industry by leveraging the company’s experience. Daniel Schreiner, Nuclear Product Manager, for Reuter-Stokes, explains: “From a Reuter-Stokes perspective we want to work right across the sector. Our detectors are essentially reactor technology agnostic. They can work with any kind of reactor, just as long as it generates neutrons.”",
            "The first NuScale project to use the detectors, which are being developed in partnership with Paragon Energy Solutions, will be the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) in Idaho Falls, Idaho, which will see the first VOYGR SMR power plant installed. It is scheduled to begin generating power in 2029. Reuter-Stokes’ detector assemblies will be responsible for monitoring the fission rate while Paragon will develop the signal processing electronics and also the associated reactor protection system. “Our partnership with Paragon, where customers can realise our combined offering of detection technology and control system technology is unique,” says Martinez.",
            "For neutron detection, the major difference between large-scale boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs) is the physical location of the neutron detector. That location drives the geometry and the size.",
            "“For the boiling water reactor fleet our detectors are located inside the nuclear core right next to the fuel bundles. Since they’re very close to the fissioning fuel the detectors can be quite small. On a pressurized water reactor our detectors are located outside of the nuclear core, maybe one or two meters away so they see significantly less neutron flux. Therefore, the neutron detectors are substantially larger and could be up to, say, 40 inches (100 cm),” says Schreiner.",
            "For small modular reactors, companies are developing reactors based on both PWR and, less frequently, BWR technologies. “While the majority of the market is going the PWR route there are some boiling water reactors currently being designed,” says Martinez, adding: “Just about everything else is a pressurised water reactor, such as NuScale, Holtech and Rolls Royce but there’s also some others that are being developed. While they’re well understood and have been theoretically worked on for decades we’re getting to the point where we’re going to construct new fourth generation plants like high-temperature gas reactors or liquid metal reactors so there’s quite a bit of variation out there. Every one has their own pros and cons.”",
            "As Schreiner observes: “We would love to make just a generic detector that worked for everyone but what we’re seeing is that the different SMR developers are different enough that we are going to have to develop bespoke detector designs for each developer. A NuScale reactor detector design is not going to work for an X-Energy reactor detector design and so on. Each one of these reactors is different and is going to require a little bit of engineering work to custom fit our detectors to that specific technology. They’re potentially each going to need a separate design and qualification effort.” For example, on the large gigawatt-scale reactors all of the Reuter-Stokes detectors are of the fission chamber type. However, for small modular reactors, because of the differing technical parameters like temperature and neutron flux, it is possible to use ionization chambers in some instances as well. Because ionization chambers do not contain uranium they don’t require special nuclear material considerations that affect things like logistics regulations. That potentially is another benefit particularly associated with SMR technologies which are designed to be easily transported to site.",
            "Nonetheless, the challenge of new reactor designs new market entrants is picked up by Martinez, who says: “They’ve done a lot of research, but are now in a commercialization phase addressing the challenges and developing the sciences to deliver an SMR facility and all the benefits that brings. We are helping these companies design what they actually need for their particular reactor design from a sensor side with practical experience. We’re already well established and we can help to make the discovery phase and design phase a bit easier. Luckily, that’s one of our sweet spots.”",
            "Phased detector development",
            "To ease the design and qualification process, Reuter-Stokes has launched a three phase programme for SMR developers. “We’ve developed this phased process to try to help in terms of risk management and cost management,” says Schreiner. The problem is that SMR developers don’t always have all the answers when considering neutron detection. “We can’t go directly into detailed design without really understanding what the requirements are for these detectors, the technical specifications and the acceptance criteria for example,” Schreiner says. However, he adds: “Since we’ve been in business for so long, we do have a large catalogue. We have thousands of different detector designs that are both fission chamber-based",
            "and also ionization chamber types. When a new customer comes in and details the neutron flux, the temperature, and the sensitivity required our physicists can go into this database and find two or three detectors that are close. We can use that as the foundation for a custom product offering. We’re not starting from scratch with detailed engineering, we’re starting from maybe anywhere from the 60 to 80 percent complete phase.”",
            "This allows a two to six month front-end engineering effort to be launched – phase one preliminary design – working with the SMR developer and the SMR fuels engineer and talking directly to detector physicists to explore issues such as the location of the detector, what the environment looks like at that specific location and then which detectors from the catalogue could work for this application.",
            "“Once that process is complete now both sides have a really good understanding of what this technical specification looks like. Then the SMR developer can publish its technical specification and we’ll provide a fixed-term quote on phase two, which is detailed design and building a prototype detector to validate all of the physics models and manufacturing processes,” says Schreiner.",
            "Once phase two is complete the process can move to qualification with the relevant nuclear regulatory authorities. “It’s a very rigorous and methodical qualification process for a nuclear safety-related detector to ensure that the detector has been qualified for the safe operation start up and shut down of a nuclear reactor. It’s a huge investment both in design and time and in dollars to get that qualification. Reuter-Stokes’ experience of going through the qualification process helps when it comes to new designs and new types of sensors,” explains Schreiner. He concludes: “It’s mitigating risk and making sure that we control costs as we progress through the phases so that we’re constantly incorporating the lessons learned as we continue to work on the project with the customer”.",
            "The pressure is on all SMR developers to keep costs down as low as possible and Martinez makes a key observation: “The most important thing in terms of making things cheaper is you got to think about it early in the process. If we can have our detector physicists talking directly to the fuels engineer and they can work out where these detectors go before the SMR design is locked in that allows the widest range of detectors that we can choose from our off the shelf database.”",
            "It’s simple steps like this that will ensure the supply chain can support SMR development in making its ambitions a reality."

        "text": [
            "US Centrus Energy Corp has completed construction of a demonstration cascade of advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges and major supporting systems in Piketon, Ohio. This is a step towards US first-of-a-kind production of High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) planned for the end of 2023, assuming it completes the remaining support systems and obtains final approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). This will be the first new US technology enrichment plant to begin production in 70 years.",
            "HALEU is an advanced nuclear fuel required for most of the next-generation reactor designs currently under development. HALEU is uranium that has been enriched to between 5% and 20% uranium 235 (U-235). This is higher than the 3-5% U-235 low-enriched uranium fuels used in the existing fleet of light water reactors.",
            "Nine of the 10 advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) will need HALEU. This includes two demonstration reactors -Terrapower’s Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor and X-energy’s Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactor. However, currently the only company able to supply HALEU fuel is Russia’s Techsnabexport (Tenex).",
            "“This is a major milestone for Centrus, for the advanced nuclear sector, and for the vital effort to restore America’s domestic uranium enrichment capability,” said Centrus Energy President & CEO Daniel B Poneman. “We are strongly committed to pioneering production of HALEU to support the deployment of US advanced reactor designs around the world. Our goal is to scale up this facility to meet the full range of commercial, government, and national security requirements for uranium enrichment, including low-enriched uranium for existing reactors and HALEU for advanced reactors.”",
            "In November 2022, DOE announced a new, competitively-awarded contract with Centrus to finish the cascade, complete final regulatory steps and begin operation. In December, Centrus Energy’s wholly-owned subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), signed a “definitised” contract with DOE to pioneer production of HALEU. As part of a previous, cost-shared contract awarded in 2019, Centrus had been deploying its AC100M advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges in Piketon and had secured a licence amendment from the NRC, making it the only NRC-licensed HALEU production site.",
            "Before operations can begin, Centrus needs to finish construction of the remaining support systems, including a fissile materials storage area, so that the HALEU produced for DOE can be stored onsite. It must also complete final operational readiness reviews with the NRC to obtain approval to begin production. The operational readiness reviews are required under Centrus’s NRC licence, which was successfully amended in 2021 to allow for HALEU production.",
            "Centrus says it is also investigating the possibility of scaling up the Piketon facility with additional centrifuge cascades for expanded HALEU production. This depends on securing sufficient funding or offtake contracts. A full-scale HALEU cascade comprises 120 individual centrifuge machines, with a combined capacity of approximately 6,000 kilograms of HALEU a year (6 MTU/year). This could be brought online within about 42 months of securing the funding with the capability to add an additional cascade every six months. Such expansion would support thousands of direct and indirect jobs across a 100% domestic manufacturing supply chain, Centrus notes. It would be capable of meeting US national security requirements.",

Anticipating the decision, TRISO-X, in October, broke ground and began construction of the facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The TRISO-X Fuel Fabrication Facility (TF3) is expected to create more than 400 jobs and attract investment of approximately $300 million. TF3 is set to be commissioned and operational by 2025.",

It was a very aggressive timeline; we felt pretty confident that we could meet it. But it was all predicated on having our first coreload of fuel come from Russia,” Navin said.",
            "Nine of the ten advanced reactor designs selected for funding under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, including two planned demonstration reactors – Natrium and X-energy’s XE-100 High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor – will rely on HALEU, which is enriched to nearly 20% with uranium-235 compared with the 5% used in power reactors.",
            "In June 2021, TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon and PacifiCorp announced efforts to advance their Natrium reactor demonstration project at a retiring coal plant in Wyoming, ultimately deciding on Naughton Power Plant outside Kemmerer as the site.",
            "The Natrium system is a TerraPower and GE Hitachi technology. Along with PacifiCorp and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, members of the demonstration project team include engineering and construction partner Bechtel, Energy Northwest, Duke Energy and nearly a dozen additional companies, universities and national laboratory partners. The project features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MWe of power for more than five and a half hours when needed.",
            "Building a fleet of advanced nuclear reactors hinges on securing a dependable fuel source. But the private sector is reluctant to risk too much money on an industry still in its infancy. Russia, the only commercial source of HALEU fuel, was supposed to bridge that gap, but this is now in question, Navin noted.",
            "Terrapower initially turned to the US Department of Energy (DOE). In the hope that the government would be able to source sufficient weapons-grade uranium (most of which will come from nuclear warheads) enriched to around 95% and downblend it to the lower concentration needed. Officials tried, Navin said, and are still looking. “They just don’t have the capacity to disassemble a large volume of warheads any faster than they’re already disassembling them.”",
            "TerraPower is also looking to Congress, which allocated half the funding for the roughly $4 billion Wyoming project and has increased efforts to accelerate commercial fuel production. These efforts are being supported by Senator John Barrasso, (Wyoming). Barrasso said in a statement on 13 December that “TerraPower’s announcement underscores what I’ve been saying for years: America must re-establish itself as the global leader in nuclear energy. Instead of relying on our adversaries like Russia for uranium, the United States must produce its own supply of nuclear fuel.”",
            "Congress authorised the HALEU Availability Program in 2020 and eventually appropriated $45 million to “expedite” HALEU fuel-processing capacity. The Inflation Reduction Act added another $700 million toward that effort. In December 2022, DOE established a HALEU consortium to support activities to secure a domestic supply of the fuel. In December, DOE also signed a contract with Centrus Energy’s subsidiary, American Centrifuge Operating (ACO), to pioneer production of HALEU at its facility leased from DOE in Piketon, Ohio.",
            "The federal support will go a long way to attract private investmenta and establish a reliable, commercial supply of HALEU in the US, perhaps in time to meet the 2028 in-service deadline in Kemmerer, Navin said. But the Natrium reactor will require an initial “core load” fuel delivery in 2025, which is why TerraPower is asking federal officials to downblend enough weapons-grade uranium to meet that timeline. Combined, TerraPower’s Natrium and X-energy’s Xe-100 demonstration projects could require about 20 metric tons of HALEU derived from downblending, Navin estimated. Centrus Energy Corp   will begin producing less than 1 metric ton by 2023.",
            "However, Navin said the fuel problems are “not going to change our schedule, in terms of when we’re going to start construction – it gives us a little more flexibility on that point”. In 2023, TerraPower still aims to break ground on a test facility at the project site, where both remaining coal units at electric utility PacifiCorp’s Naughton Power Plant are slated to retire in 2025, and apply for a construction permit from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
            "“We all recognised when we started this process, it was never going to be easy,” he said. “We didn’t anticipate this particular curveball, but this is, certainly, of all of the challenges that we’re facing, the one that is going to cause the biggest delay.” TerraPower remains confident, however, that the U.S. supply chain will be ready to support up to five more reactors of the same design in Wyoming and Utah by 2035. Its joint study with PacifiCorp of the available options, announced in October, is on track to be finished late next year.",
            "“We obviously have to focus on getting the first one built,” Navin said. “There’s always hiccups in a first-of-a-kind project. But we really are committed to working with our customer in PacifiCorp and trying to find a way to even expand the footprint that we have in Wyoming.”",
            "One other question, however, remains. Natrium is a sodium-cooled fast reactor. Currently the USA has no expertise in fast reactor technology and no facilities to support its development. The US closed down its fast reactor programme in the 1990s and is only now making moves to revive it. The US Department of Energy (DOE) in July issued a record of decision to build a sodium-cooled fast test reactor at Idaho National Laboratory (INL). If appropriated by Congress, the Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) would be the first fast reactor to operate in the USA in nearly three decades. Even if the fuel problem is somehow resolved, this could be another obstacle.",

X-energy and Frostburg State’s analysis will assist MEA and policymakers in providing meaningful information relating to energy management, promoting the transfer and commercialisation of energy technology from private and public laboratories to citizens of the State, and helping MEA develop strategic plans and implement policies relating to energy supply management."

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has listed five key takeaways from DOE’s latest budget request that advance nuclear energy and help support the nation’s ambitious goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.",
            "(DOE released its Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) Budget request in April. The request includes $1.7 billion for NE and is one of the highest ever requests for NE. “This will allow the office to act swiftly on funding activities to support emerging technologies and improvements to the nuclear fuel cycle,” NE said.",
            "The Budget complements the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), which provides more than $62 billion for DOE over five years to deliver a more equitable clean energy future. The BIL includes funding to demonstrate advanced reactors, preserve the existing fleet, and develop new ways to produce clean hydrogen, including the use of nuclear energy. NE said it “will continue supporting the implementation of the BIL in coordination with the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations and the Grid Deployment Office”.",
            "Advanced reactor demos are moving to the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations: The BIL includes approximately $2.5 billion through FY26 to support the demonstrations of X-energy’s Xe-100 reactor and TerraPower’s Natrium reactor in the USA. Project management and oversight functions for both projects will be carried out under DOE’s new Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations as outlined in the BIL. NE will continue to manage other projects under the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP).",
            "The R&D request is increased by 8%. NE is requesting roughly $725 million in research and development activities — an 8% increase over the FY22 request. The request includes $140 million to support projects awarded under ARDP and $12 million to help mature three additional design concepts. The request also supports continued development of small modular and microreactor projects, including MARVEL, which will be used to demonstrate end-use applications in the mid-2020s.",
            "HALEU should be made available for advanced reactor fuel. NE is requesting $95 million to further establish a programme to incentivise the commercial production of high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel. The funding will be used to procure enriched uranium and deconversion services under the recently formed HALEU Availability programme. The request also supports DOE’s HALEU enrichment demonstration project that is expected to produce 900 kilograms of HALEU a year to help support the demonstration of advanced reactors.",
            "US university R&D should be advanced. NE is consolidating some of its funding into a new bucket this year to better serve small businesses and US universities, with specific attention to the needs of minority serving institutions (MSIs) and disadvantaged communities. The office is requesting $161 million to support emerging technologies developed by US universities, colleges, and small businesses. The funding also supports university infrastructure improvements and fuel services along with workforce development, including scholarships and fellowships. This newly proposed line item in the budget will allow faculty to propose bolder and more creative R&D directions and empower NE to support the expansion of nuclear engineering programmes at MSIs. NE plans to issue a request for information by the end of fiscal year 2022 to help identify research infrastructure and other capabilities as a focus for those new and expanding university programmes.",
            "Consent-based siting is important. NE’s budget request includes $53 million to further develop DOE’s integrated waste management strategy for used nuclear fuel. The request includes money to continue early-phase funding for interested groups, communities, States, and Tribes to explore consent-based siting and interim storage, support mutual learning, and reduce barriers to participation in the consent-based siting process."
