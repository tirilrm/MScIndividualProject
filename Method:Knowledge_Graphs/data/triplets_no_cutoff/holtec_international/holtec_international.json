            "Three or more advanced reactor applications expected within 12 months, but investment needed in new capacity",
            "Nuclear energy remains the key to unlocking a cleaner, more secure future, but investment is needed in new capacity along with incentives, grants and support for next-generation reactors and the current fleet, Washington-based Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI) president and chief executive officer Maria Korsnick has said.",
            "“At every level of society – across borders and aisles and industries and sectors – support for nuclear has materialised into demand,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 15 May. “And the race to realise its potential is officially underway.”",
            "She said: “One thing Vogtle has taught us: with every new unit, we learn something new,” Korsnick said during an annual state of the industry address on 14 May, referring to the two recently completed AP1000 reactor units in the US state of Georgia. ",
            "“The construction gets more efficient, the costs get more reasonable. The risks decrease, the benefits increase,” she said. “We need to ensure that early movers go forward and therefore incentives and grants are needed,” she said. ",
            "“So, we work with [the US] Congress to reduce the cost of first-of-a- kind. The US, the Congress, has approved tax credits, also hydrogen tax credits, so that we get a robust hydrogen economy. So, we need national leaders to continue this process,” Korsnick said.",
            "A recent study by Washington-based power sector consulting firm Grid Strategies predicts the grid will need to add 38 GW, or more, of new electricity capacity during the next five years, driven by advanced computing, artificial intelligence, and the electrification of the manufacturing and transportation sectors, Korsnick said.",
            "Over the next 12 months, three or more applications for advanced modular reactors are expected to be submitted to the US nuclear Regulatory Commission and two or more advanced reactor projects are expected to begin construction, according to Korsnick",
            "Additionally, the “Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission is likely to approve the construction permit for the GE-Hitachi BWRX-300 at Ontario's Darlington site,” she said.",
            "In addition to 12 submittals for 20-year licence renewals, one more plant will be added to this list and will submit a licence renewal application to the NRC this year, Korsnick also said.",
            "“Several utilities are preparing numerous power uprates, with a cumulative capacity increase of approximately 2.5 GW of new carbon-free generation, the equivalent of more than two large light-water-reactors,” Korsnick said.",
            "“Utilities are now extending the lives of some plants to 80 years and taking steps to restart others, like Holtec’s Palisades plant in Michigan, while in California, the Department of Energy reached an agreement with PG&E to support extending operations of Diablo Canyon,” Korsnick noted, saying that “since her last speech [in 2023] , we have seen significant progress in the industry”.",
            "Korsnick said that over the last 12 months the industry has advanced more applications through the regulatory process, including applications from Kairos Power, NuScale and the Bill Gates-founded TerraPower, which submitted a construction permit application for its Kemmerer, Wyoming Natrium plant and plans to break ground “just a few weeks from now”.",
            "The “NEI is also working with Houston-based Shepherd Power to significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to licence microreactors, from an average of five years per application to just four months. “A shift in [the licensing] paradigm will have benefits for small modular reactors and large reactors too,” she said. ",
            "“While Democrats and Republicans can’t agree on much, they agree that nuclear is the key to both national security and global competitiveness, Korsnick said. ",
            "She said other nations need nuclear energy and “they want to do business with us”.",
            "The NEI hosted meetings last year with more than 20 countries interested in cooperating on nuclear with the US.",
            "The Philippines is starting a nuclear power programme, has already signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the US and is taking significant steps towards deployment by 2032.",
            "At the first US-Africa Nuclear Energy Summit, Ghana announced it will choose nuclear vendors by the end of the year.",
            "On the need for a secure supply of nuclear fuel, Korsnick said “we cannot continue to power our country – let alone the world – on the back of Russian uranium”.",
            "She said “re-shoring” fuel production to American soil is imperative and after lawmakers recently approved $2.72bn (€2.5bn) in funding to support a domestic fuel supply “we are one step closer to making this long-held goal a reality”.",
            "As a condition of this funding, the US Congress passed a ban on Russian uranium fuel imports and president Biden signed it into law on 13 May, Korsnick noted.",
            "“To that end, we are focused on two things: Work with the Department of Energy to ensure this funding builds a competitive domestic supply chain and revitalises US capabilities to convert and enrich uranium,” she said.",
            "The Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act bars imports from Russia, but allows for temporary waivers until January 2028 if “no alternative viable source of low-enriched uranium is available to sustain the continued operation of a nuclear reactor or a United States nuclear energy company” or if the imports are determined to be in the national interest. Korsnick called for the waiver process to be “predictable and efficient”.",
            "She said advanced fuel technologies will be deployed over the next few years with enhanced accident tolerant features, increased enrichment and higher fuel efficiencies, enabling power upgrades and longer fuel cycles.",
            "She listed recent progress in advanced fuel development including Urenco’s approval of its first expansion project last year at its plant in New Mexico, Orano’s approval of a $1.8bn investment to increase enrichment capacity and the announcement that ConverDyn, the only converter in the US, had restarted its plant last year.",
            "“And Centrus started production of high assay low-enriched uranium [Haleu] in October 2023 – becoming the first new US-owned uranium enrichment plant to begin production since 1954,” Korsnick added.",
            "“The reason behind this race toward nuclear is simple,” she said. “The world needs more power, and we need it sooner than projected.”",

            "The UK should consider a range of technologies for future large-scale nuclear power plants as it seeks to revive the sector, according to the top official overseeing those efforts. ",
            "Simon Bowen, chair of Great British Nuclear, the public body responsible for the delivery of new projects, told the Financial Times the UK would need “at least another couple” of large nuclear power stations after the two EPR plants currently under construction by French state-owned power company EDF at Hinkley Point C. ",
            "The French utility is also jointly developing plans with the British government to build a second station using the EPR design at Sizewell in Suffolk.",
            "But Bowen added that a pause was needed before the UK decided on what technology to use in those future large plants, which will form part of the country’s drive to meet its net zero goals. ",
            "“I think from a value-for-money perspective, we’ve got to pause and look and just check that we’ve got our strategy right,” he said. ",
            "Bowen said other technologies worth considering included Westinghouse’s AP1000 plant, which has already been through the UK regulatory process, as well as South Korea’s APR-1400 and Canadian Candu designs. He acknowledged that as the UK was building two EPR-based plants there was a good case for using the same design.",
            "In January, the UK government set out plans for what it claimed will be Britain’s biggest nuclear power expansion in 70 years with the possible construction of about 11 new reactors by 2050 – enough to meet a quarter of the national electricity demand.",
            "Ministers published a roadmap that recommitted the government to building a fleet of nuclear reactors capable of producing 24 GW by 2050 – an increase from around 5.8 GW today.",
            "The government is also running a competition for companies to design and build small modular reactors. In October it selected six companies to advance to the next phase of the competition. The companies are: EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK.",

            "The Palisades nuclear power station in the US state of Michigan is in “superb material condition” and on track to become the first successfully restarted commercial nuclear power plant in the US following the announcement on Wednesday of a $1.52bn (€1.41bn) loan guarantee, owner Holtec said. ",
            "The Biden administration announced that it had agreed to provide the loan guarantee to help a company restart the single-unit Palisades – the latest step in the government’s effort to revive the nation’s reactors.",
            "The project aims to bring the station’s single reactor unit back into commercial operation by the end of 2025 and keep it operating until at least 2051.",
            "Energy secretary Jennifer Granholm announced the funding to employees at the station, saying: “By our estimates, to reach our net-zero goals by 2050 we need to triple, at least, our nuclear energy supply. This is a big win for America, a big win for the nation.”",
            "“Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly,” Granholm said.",
            "There may be more federal support for Palisades in the future, Granholm said. She said the Biden administration is eyeing additional investments in nuclear power, including support for the development of small modular reactor technology and tax incentives for nuclear power generation.",
            "“There may be other opportunities for us to co-invest, let’s just say that,” Granholm said.",
            "New Jersey-based Holtec bought Palisades, which was first connected to the grid in 1971, from previous owner Entergy in 2022 to decommission the 805-MW pressurised water reactor facility, which had struggled to compete with natural gas-fired plants and renewable energy.",
            "In early 2023, Holtec applied to the Department of Energy for federal loan funding to repower the facility. That was followed by a “rigorous” review of the loan application by the DOE and third-party advisors to consider technical, market, financial, credit, legal, and regulatory aspects, among others, Holtec said. ",
            "The conditional commitment is subject to final approval, which is dependent on Holtec meeting loan closing conditions and regulatory approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ",
            "In addition to federal loan funding, the repowering initiative has received critical financial support from the state of Michigan. In July 2023, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, signed into law the state’s 2024 budget, which provides $150m in funding for the restart. ",
            "Holtec said it is separately making a substantial out-of-pocket capital investment in the restart programme.",
            "Holtec bought the Palisades plant in 2022 in order to close the facility, but later campaigned to reopen the plant with the backing of Whitmer. The company had initially planned to repurpose the 174-hectare site, but the Biden administration’s $6bn of aid for upgrading nuclear facilities in the US led the company to reconsider its plans.",
            "“A few years ago, we set out to do what many thought was impossible,” Whitmer said on social media platform X. “After the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant closed, we got to work to save 600 jobs and power 800,000 homes with American-made, clean energy. Today’s announcement brings us one step closer towards making history.”",
            "She said in a separate statement: “Once open, Palisades will be the first successfully restarted nuclear power plant in American history, driving $363 million of regional economic impact and helping Michigan lead the future of clean energy.”",
            "Federal loan guarantees and grants are expected to help extend the life other nuclear plants.",
            "California in recent years reversed its decision to close the Diablo Canyon nuclear power station because lawmakers were concerned that the state will not have enough sources of electricity to avoid rolling blackouts on hot summer afternoons. The DOE awarded $1.1bn to Pacific Gas & Electric to continue operations at the facility, which has two reactors.",
            "The US has the largest nuclear energy operation in the world, with 94 units across the country, including two new ones at the Vogtle nuclear site in Georgia. In 2022, nuclear generated a little over 18% of the country’s electricity, according to International Atomic Energy Agency data. US Energy Information Administration data shows that in 2023 about 60% of electricity generation was from fossil fuels – coal, natural gas, petroleum and other gases – with renewables at about 21%.",

Energy security is also security for the UK.”",
            "He also said that “building a coherent system is the UK government approach [to the nuclear energy industry] rather than bits here and there.”",
            "He implied that currently the UK has got a system with bits here and there unlike the French one, but this is now changing. ",
            "Heffer also noted that high assay low enriched uranium (Haleu) would be an “important addition to the market and that there are some [important] commercial or technological decisions” to soon be made on Haleu.",
            "Speaking during the same event on 23 February, Guy Esnouf, GBN’s director of communications, said that GBN has a “role on the planning, regulations and siting” of SMRs in the UK, through its oversight of the SMR competition. ",
            "Esnouf also said that GBN was “putting the contract together” to select at least one SMR design for deployment in the UK, and that GBN would also “set up development companies” to establish and construct SMRs in the UK, using the designs selected in the competition. ",
            "He added that the UK government and GBN hoped that an FID would be made on the first SMR to be deployed in the UK by 2029. ",
            "“The key timeline is FID by the end of 2029, that is really important, this is urgent,” Esnouf said. ",
            "GBN is working on SMR siting “during the first half of 2024, we will look to find and purchase sites or the reactor developers will develop their own sites. We are looking at sites and are focused on areas with nuclear experience,” Esnouf noted. ",
            "GBN would “look to place at least one or two SMRs at sites” that it selected for deployment, but GBN and the UK government really “want to build a fleet of SMRs” according to Esnouf. ",
            "“We need to take advantage of modularity to get quicker and more reliable development” of SMRs, Esnouf also said. ",
            "“We need to learn how to build a fleet and need to go beyond one or two sites,” he added. ",
            "In the second half of last year, the UK government has selected six SMR companies to continue to the next phase of a competition to design and build small modular reactors.",
            "These companies include EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec Britain, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. ",
            "The next bid expected, but not confirmed, as early as end of this month will secure the second round of the pre-selection process. ",
            "The DESNZ had said at the first selection round that the designs were “the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s”.",
            "The UK wants new nuclear to play role in its future net-zero energy transition as its ageing reactor fleet is preparing for retirement over the next decade."

            "Industry seeing growing demand for strategic pan-European approach",
            "An overall roadmap – which could come as soon 4 January – is needed to determine the next steps for new nuclear construction in the UK, including small modular reactors, an EDF executive said at a London industry conference. ",
            "The nuclear power industry is seeing growing demand for a strategic European approach, including in the UK, to enable SMR projects at different stages of development to get off the ground.  ",
            "Anne Falchi, head of strategy, nuclear new build, at EDF said: “I believe in a European SMR, as Europe has the ambition of having 150 GW of capacity by 2050, so effectively we will need to build 120 GW of nuclear capacity in Europe by 2050.” ",
            "“EDF knows well the UK’s capabilities, therefore we will need to identify new UK sites, so these activities can be localised”, she added.  ",
            "“Great British Nuclear [GBN] is looking in the right direction in relation to UK SMR deployment, and EDF has the experience of working with around 100 UK companies,” according to Falchi. “Namely, GBN has a very clear roadmap within Europe for its SMRs,” she said. ",
            "“We need a lot of large nuclear reactors. I do not believe in a UK or a French supply chain, but a European supply chain, so the UK needs to figure out what it is best at”, she added. ",
            "“We have EU partners to bring together the best capabilities, so we are trying not to localise the supply chain. ",
            "EDF’s Nuward SMR subsidiary is looking to develop the Nuward SMR, consisting of two 170-MW SMRs combined to form a 340-MW SMR plant using two pressurised water reactors (PWRs). The Nuward design has been developed using France's extensive experience in PWRs. ",
            "Falchi said “EDF is looking forward to see an overall roadmap for nuclear power in the UK, so that the country can reach serial production of the same reactor.” Such a roadmap should also include information on the potential location of new units in the country, she added. ",
            "Realising the promise of SMRs is a priority, including the delivery, cost and use of UK made nuclear fuel, said Rory O'Neil, director of government affairs, Westinghouse UK. He added that “there will be a global supply chain” for SMRs.  ",
            "“SMR procurement and [SMR] competition work is GBN’s most high profile workstream, although I also have AMR [advanced nuclear reactor] responsibilities”, said Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN’s interim chief executive officer at the annual Nuclear Industry Association conference in London earlier this month. ",
            "She said that maximising the ability to put nuclear power on the grid is key, as well as the need to work with a future system operator. A further priority is “the use of regulation and creation of a system for modularisation”, of new nuclear units, she added. “The nuclear roadmap, which is expected in January 2024, is built on specific points,” she said. ",
            "GBN is also planning to publish documents about siting principles and routes to markets, along with the nuclear roadmap. ",
            "EDF is competing with other developers to build SMRs in the UK, although the company has the advantage of being an established player and investor in the UK nuclear power market. ",
            "EDF has been selected by the UK government to participate in the next stage of the competition to develop one or more SMR designs in the UK, alongside GE-Hitachi, Holtec Britain, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse. ",
            "Renaud Crassous, Nuward’s president, has said in a press interview that the aim of the Nuward reactor design is to “fully integrate catalysts for success” of this SMR design, such as innovation, modularisation, standardisation and series production, thus speeding the start of the construction of the first SMR. ",
            "The French nuclear safety regulator, as well as the Czech and Finnish regulators, are now collaborating for a pilot European early joint regulatory review of the Nuward design. EDF is cooperating with Italian companies on SMR development to achieve a standard for the European market.  ",
            "EDF, which holds the majority ownership of the Italian energy company Edison, signed a letter of intent earlier this year with Italy's Ansaldo Energia, Ansaldo Nucleare and Edison to assess potential industrial cooperation for the development of nuclear power in Europe, especially SMRs.",
            "According to the French SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a first SMR is scheduled to begin in 2026, while the construction of the first unit is expected to take around three years after first concrete is laid in 2030. ",
            "Industry insiders think that the European SMR market has a great potential if SMR designs are standardised and if the reactor developers receive a certain level of state funding. ",
            "US-based Westinghouse is also hoping to deploy its AP300 small modular reactor in the UK and Europe. Courtesy Westinghouse.",

            "Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom and US-based Holtec International have signed an agreement for the potential deployment of up to 20 small modular reactors with the first pilot project connected to the grid by March 2029.",
            "The agreement sees Energoatom and Holtec jointly developing a plan for the expedited construction and commissioning of up the Holtec SMR-160 plants in Ukraine and for establishing a manufacturing facility in the country for the production of equipment required to build the plants.",
            "The two companies will establish a joint office to carry out work for licensing and deployment of SMR-160 reactor technology throughout Ukraine, with the focus on former coal generation sites.",
            "Energoatom, which owns and operates Ukraine’s fleet of 15 commercial nuclear power plants, said on social media the agreement provides for “more profound” cooperation between the companies aimed at strengthening of energy security of Ukraine. “The agreement will contribute to the overall de-carbonisation of the Ukrainian energy sector, the strengthening of energy independence of Ukraine, and will launch high-tech production of SMR components on our territory,” the company said.",
            "Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said the construction of small modular reactors in Ukraine would contribute to the strengthening of the country’s energy security and would also allow replacing thermal power plants destroyed by Russian attacks and the achievement of decarbonisation goals. ",
            "“We plan a complete replacement of thermal generation” Galushchenko said. “The best way to replace coal is with small modular reactors.”",
            "He said Ukraine has significant human potential for the development of advanced nuclear technologies and will try, in particular in cooperation with American partners, to “remove the Russian nuclear industry from the world market”. ",
            "Energoatom president Petro Kotin said the agreement will allow help Ukraine emerge as a regional hub for Holtec’s reactor technology. He said the agreement will lead to economic development, job creation, the establishment of modern manufacturing facilities, training facilities and R&D centres.",
            "The SMR-160 is a light-water based pressurised SMR, which generates 160 MWe (525 MWth) and relies on gravity to operate the reactor and the passive safety systems.",
            "Holtec said that unlike today’s operating plants, the SMR-160 is designed so that all the cooling water needed for safe shutdown, under even the most severe accident scenarios, is integral to the plant and securely located to prevent the reactor from overheating.",
            "In August 2020 the SMR-160 design completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing vendor design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a generic design assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "The Holtec agreement is not the first SMR agreement for Ukraine. In March Energoatom and UK-based Rolls-Royce SMR signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the deployment of SMRs.",
            "Haluschenko said earlier this year that Ukraine was considering ambitious plans to build up to 20 SMRs to replace thermal generation units destroyed during the war with Russia.",
            "“This is the best option to replace thermal generation,” Haluschenko was quoted as saying by Ukrainian and Russian media sources. “We will move towards the green transition on SMR technology, this is the best technology.”",

It adds that the issue \"must be considered when selecting technologies for investment, further development, construction and operation\".",
            "The paper says: \"This must involve addressing the uncertainties about such management at an early stage, to avoid costly mistakes which have been made in the past, by designing reactors without sufficient consideration of how spent fuel and wastes would be managed, and also to provide financial certainty for investors regarding lifetime costs of operation and decommissioning.\"",
            "CoRWM says it is essential to know: the nature and composition of the waste and, in particular, of the used fuel; its likely heat generation and activity levels; how it could feasibly be packaged and its volume; and when it is likely to arise.",

The acquisition was completed in June 2022, within weeks of the reactor's closure, and at that time Holtec planned to complete the dismantling, decontamination, and remediation of the plant by 2041. But the company then announced plans to apply for federal funding to enable it to reopen the plant, with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer amongst those pledging support for the move. The State of Michigan's Fiscal Year 2024 budget, signed by Whitmer in mid-2023, provides USD150 million in funding towards the plant's restart.",
            "Responding to the loan guarantee announcement, Whitmer said reopening Palisades would protect 600 \"good-paying, high-skill jobs\" as well as \"clean, reliable power\" for 800,000 homes. \"Once open, Palisades will be the first successfully restarted nuclear power plant in American history, driving USD363 million of regional economic impact and helping Michigan lead the future of clean energy,\" she said.",
            "In October 2023, Holtec formally began the process of seeking reauthorisation from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to restart Palisades, having already signed a long-term power purchase agreement with the non-profit Wolverine Power Cooperative for the sale of the output from the restarted plant.",
            "Subject to NRC approvals, the project aims to bring the plant back online and upgrade it to produce baseload clean power until at least 2051, the Department of Energy (DOE) said. Restarting the plant will avoid some 4.47 million tonnes of CO2 emissions per year, for a total of 111 million tonnes over the next 25 years.",
            "\"Nuclear power is our single largest source of carbon-free electricity, directly supporting 100,000 jobs across the country and hundreds of thousands more indirectly,\" said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. \"President Biden's Investing in America agenda is supporting and expanding this vibrant clean energy workforce here in Michigan with significant funding for the Holtec Palisades nuclear power plant.\"",
            "Holtec Palisades is the first project to be offered a conditional commitment through the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) programme under the US Inflation Reduction Act, a wide-ranging bill including clean energy, climate mitigation and resilience, agriculture, and conservation-related investment programmes which was signed into law in August 2022. The EIR programme can finance projects to repower existing energy infrastructure that has been non-operational, or enable operating infrastructure, to combat greenhouse gas emissions.",
            "Holtec has also said it intends to locate its first two small modular reactor units at Palisades. Although this will not be financed under the conditional commitment, the DOE said the SMR units \"would potentially add an additional 800 MW of capacity at the site, take advantage of existing infrastructure, and spur the domestic development of new reactor technologies, which is critical to combatting the climate crisis\".",
            "Palisades began commercial operation in 1971. The plant had a \"distinguished record of safe and reliable operation\", according to Holtec, with Entergy's decision to close it driven by economic, rather than operational, considerations and coincided with the expiration of a 15-year power purchase agreement with Consumers Energy.",
            "The unit was defuelled following its shutdown, but since the plant's infrastructure already exists, the project to restart it does not involve traditional major construction activities, DOE said. It will, however, require inspections, testing, refurbishment, rebuilding, and replacement of existing equipment.",
            "Holtec will be required to satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the DOE enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan.",

            "Holtec Maintenance & Modification International (HMI) is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and is being headed by Christopher Bakken. In its statement announcing the move, Holtec International said the new company's mission was \"to meet the time-critical maintenance and modification needs of the world’s operating nuclear power plants with assured performance certainty\".",
            "It added: \"To provide maximum value to its clients, HMI is poised to introduce cutting edge technologies such as AI-aided preventive maintenance and robot-led crew radiation dose reduction methods at its clients’ plants ... we believe the HMI management model will bring about a vastly improved control of operating costs of nuclear plants and ensure heightened plant reliability, which will support the expected renaissance in nuclear generation around the world.\"",
            "HMI will operate under its parent company's programmes on nuclear quality assurance, environmental protection, personnel safety assurance, corporate governance and supply management \"but will be otherwise autonomous\". It will work with Holtec’s Nuclear Power Division \"to provide replacement components and systems - reverse engineered as necessary to replace obsolescent items - to meet target outage schedules\".",
            "As well as its initial work on the project to restart the 840 MWe Palisades plant, Holtec says that \"discussions with other clients in the USA and overseas are under way\".",
            "Rick Springman, Holtec’s President of Global Clean Energy Opportunities, said: \"With the launch of HMI, we can now provide an integrated capability to meet the operating needs of the scores of SMR-300 plants that we hope to be building in the US and around the world.\"",

            "Hundreds of coal power plant sites across the USA could be converted to nuclear plant sites, providing huge decarbonisation gains as well as bringing tangible economic, employment and environmental benefits to the communities where those plants are located, a new US Department of Energy (DOE) study has found.",
            "Hundreds of US coal power plant sites could be converted to nuclear power plants (Image: DOE)",
            "A coal-to-nuclear (C2N) transition - siting a nuclear reactor at the site of a recently retired coal power plant - could help increase US nuclear capacity to more than 350 GWe,",
            "Investigating Benefits and Challenges of Converting Retiring Coal Plants into Nuclear Plants",
            "found. The USA's current nuclear fleet has a combined capacity of 95 GWe.",
            "The report is underpinned by a study carried out by the Argonne, Idaho and Oak Ridge National Laboratories, sponsored by the DOE Office of Nuclear Energy. It is guided by three overarching questions: where in the USA are retired coal facilities located and what factors make a site feasible for transition; what factors of technology, cost, and project timeline drive investor economics over such a decision; and how will C2N impact local communities?",
            "The team screened recently retired and active coal plant sites to identify 157 retired and 237 operating coal plants sites as potential candidates for a C2N transition, which it further evaluated on parameters including population density, distance from seismic fault lines, flooding potential, and nearby wetlands, to determine if they could safely host a nuclear power plant. It found that 80% of the potential sites are suitable for hosting advanced nuclear power plants of varying size and type, depending on the size of the site being converted.",
            "The team then evaluated a case study of detailed impacts and potential outcomes from a C2N transition at a hypothetical site, considering various nuclear technology types for a range of scenarios including large light-water reactors, small modular reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors and very high temperature reactors.",
            "At the regional level, replacing a large coal plant site with a nuclear power plant of equivalent size could provide some 650 jobs and USD275 million of economic activity, the report found. These jobs are spread across the plant, the supply chain supporting the plant, and the community surrounding the plant and most typically come with wages that are about 25% higher than any other energy technology. Nuclear power plant projects could also benefit from preserving the existing experienced workforce in communities around retiring coal plant sites, which already possess the necessary skills and knowledge that could be tranistioned to work at a nuclear power plant.",
            "Reusing existing coal infrastructure for new advanced nuclear reactors can lead to construction cost savings of 15-35%, the report found. Using existing land, grid connections, office buildings, electrical equipment such as transmission connections and switchyards, and civil infrastructure could also save millions of dollars upfront.",
            "Economic potential exists for owners of coal power plants - and the communities where they are located - from a C2N transition, the report concludes, with a potential further advantage for interested coal communities to be \"first movers\" in what the authors say could be a series of many C2N transitions across the USA. Although the study's findings inform only at a general level, the results could be used to set up more detailed, in-depth analyses to allow more accurate evaluations specific to a particular coal plant or nuclear technology design.",
            "The report was subjected to independent peer reviews by experts in systems engineering and regional economic modelling to evaluate analysis and assumptions.",
            "The possibility of replacing coal power plants with nuclear capacity is being actively explored in the USA and elsewhere. TerraPower in 2021 announced plans to build a demonstration unit of its Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor at a retired coal plant site in Wyoming; earlier this year, the the Maryland Energy Administration announced its support for work to evaluate the possibility of repurposing a coal-fired electric generating facility with X-energy’s Xe-100 small modular reactor; and Holtec International recently said it is considering coal plant sites as possible locations for its SMR-160 with plans to bring the first unit online as early as 2029. In Poland, NuScale is exploring with energy company Unimot and copper and silver producer KGHM possibilities for its reactors to replace coal-fired power plants.",

            "The agreement was signed on 21 April by Energoatom President Petro Kotin in Kiev and Holtec CEO Kris Singh in Camden, New Jersey, USA. The ceremony was also attended by Ukraine's Minister of Energy Herman Galushchenko and the vice president of Holtec International operations in Ukraine Riaz Avan.",
            "The cooperation agreement envisions implementation of the first SMR-160 Pilot Project with the goal to reach minimum controlled reactor power and connection to the grid by March 2029, Holtec said. \"The cooperation agreement further contemplates Energoatom and Holtec jointly developing an efficient execution plan for an expedited construction and commissioning of up to 20 additional SMR-160 plants in Ukraine and for establishing a manufacturing facility in the country for localising the production of a variety of equipment required to build SMR-160 reactors\".",
            "The agreement calls for a joint project office to be established to begin work required for licensing and deployment of Holtec's SMR-160s throughout Ukraine, with a focus on former coal generation sites. Energoatom noted the office will be staffed \"not only by representatives of Energoatom and Holtec International, but also by the State Atomic Energy Regulatory Commission, the National Nuclear Research and Development Centre of Ukraine, the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine, and world-renowned companies Mitsubishi, Hyundai, and others\".",
            "\"Construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) in Ukraine would not only contribute to the strengthening of the country's energy security, but would also allow replacing thermal power plants destroyed by Russian attacks and achieving decarbonisation goals,\" Galushchenko said. \"We plan a complete replacement of thermal generation. The best way to replace coal is with small modular reactors. SMRs are a powerful technology that would also allow us to decentralise the generation.\"",
            "\"The cooperation agreement between Energoatom and Holtec International signed today for deployment of SMR-160s is based on two decades of demonstrated successful cooperation between the two companies,\" Kotin said.",
            "\"This cooperation agreement will lead to economic development, creation of jobs, establishment of modern manufacturing facilities, training facilities, R&D, and thus help Ukraine emerge as the regional hub for Holtec's nuclear reactor technology. Furthermore, the cooperation agreement will play an important role in enhancing Ukraine's energy security and advancing our country’s decarbonisation, energy independence, and diversification goals\".",
            "Singh added: \"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with you to build and commission up to 20 SMR-160 reactors in record time. We are committed to helping the Ukrainian nation rebuild its energy infrastructure.\"",
            "Holtec's 160 MWe factory-built SMR uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The reactor's core and all nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, and the design incorporates a wealth of features including a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat.",
            "\"This agreement seeks to strengthen the decades-long relationship between Ukraine and Holtec to provide clean energy solutions to the nation and sets down a pathway for a green energy future for Ukraine in the post-Russian aggression age,\" Holtec said.",
            "In March 2018, a memorandum of understanding was signed between Holtec and Energoatom envisaging the adoption by Ukraine of Holtec's SMR technology with the country becoming a manufacturing hub for SMR-160 reactor components. The MoU included the licensing and construction of SMR-160 reactors in Ukraine, as well as the partial localisation of SMR-160 components. The Ukrainian manufacturing hub is to mirror the capabilities of Holtec's Advanced Manufacturing Plant in Camden, and will be one of four manufacturing plants Holtec plans to build at distributed sites around the world by the mid-2020s.",
            "In June 2019, Holtec, Energoatom and Ukraine's State Scientific and Technology Centre formally entered into a partnership to advance the SMR-160 for deployment in Ukraine. The partners ratified the creation of a consortium partnership that bound the three companies into a cooperative undertaking to progress the deployment of the SMR-160 small modular reactor in the country. The consortium is a US company registered in Delaware with each of the three parties owning allotted shares. Its technology operation centre will be based in Kiev, Ukraine.",

[and] also achieves one of the most important goals in strengthening the energy independence of our country. At the same time, cost savings for the removal and dry storage of spent nuclear fuel from domestic nuclear power plants this year alone have already fully covered the costs of the construction.\"",
            "Holtec President and CEO Kris Singh said: \"",

That journey has finally come to fruition ... the successful transport and storage of spent nuclear fuel by Energoatom from its operating nuclear reactors to the Central Spent Fuel Storage Facility is a fitting symbol of Ukraine’s resolve to achieve complete operational independence in regard to management of its spent fuel discharged by the country’s fleet of reactors and provide a safe and economic solution for long-term management of used nuclear fuel at its domestic centralised storage facility. This facility now has made Ukraine an international leader in consolidated storage of spent nuclear fuel.\"",
            "He said Holtec's \"high-capacity Double Wall Multi-Purpose Canisters and the world’s most thermally efficient transport cask HI-STAR 190 will become Ukraine’s workhorse to transport the country’s used fuel from its nine reactors to the nation’s consolidated interim storage facility\". Although the design life of the new facility is 100 years he said he expected it \"to be many times longer\".",
            "Most of the equipment for the centre was manufactured at Holtec facilities in the USA, although contractors in Estonia, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands were also involved. Energoatom and Holtec have plans to create a joint venture enterprise to develop a manufacturing and technology centre in Ukraine to localise production of equipment for the storage and transportation of used nuclear fuel and also for equipment for Holtec's small modular reactor.",

            "podcast interview covering future nuclear energy capacity in the UK.",
            "The six contenders in the small modular reactor contest (Image: Composite of each firm's visuals)",
            "The interview with GBN chairman Simon Bowen took place shortly after the UK government unveiled a roadmap to achieving 24GW of nuclear capacity by 2050, and as the six shortlisted companies (EDF, GE Hitachi, Holtec, NuScale, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse) await the next stage of the GBN-led selection process for the UK's small modular reactor programme. Here is an edited selection of key quotes:",
            "How significant is the UK government's roadmap for GBN?",
            "I think it's an overwhelmingly positive document, the next stage in the creation of the nuclear programme for the UK. It gives GBN three roles - it talks about GBN running the SMR selection process. It then talks about us taking on broader nuclear delivery, which means that if we do another gigawatt unit it is likely we'll run the selection process and then run the project and also, when advanced modular reactors (AMRs) come to fruition, it is highly likely that we would run that as well. The third role, which is really important, is that we advise government on the development of policy.",
            "What about the Roadmap more generally?",
            "The important thing is the reiteration of the target of up to 24GW with three to seven gigawatts every five years between 2030 and 2044, which I think is very important because it signals the range that we're aiming at. And then the reiteration that we are going to explore another gigawatt reactor after Sizewell, which for me is very, very important, because there is no way that we're going to get to 2050 and 24GW without the whole range and scales of reactors. Some big announcements on HALEU ... it also talks about the importance of regulation and skills and supply chains. Some people may say there's not a huge amount new in there - well there is, and there is the commitment of government to go on and deliver the programme. And it starts to spell out what the heart of that might be. It's a great step forward and a step in the right direction for forming the UK's new nuclear programme, which we will be accountable for delivering alongside our colleagues in Sizewell and Hinkley.",
            "The short-term focus of SMRs on the eight sites declared in the existing national policy statement is an important set of criteria that we are applying, but I think everybody recognises that if you're going to go after 24GW then those sites are simply not going to be enough, because we live on a small island and and we've got to have much more flexibility about the sites that we have access to. We have to allow the market to have access to the sites we are no longer looking at, or, the consultation is suggesting, that we should no longer be looking at the designation of sites, we should be looking at a criteria-based model which allows the developers to identify the sites and the usages they think they need, and then the criteria that they think should be applied, which should give an awful lot more flexibility to the market to deliver market-led projects. The second part is all about how you enable all of that and the whole role of planning, of environmental consenting, smarter regulation and the documentation - there's some really important consultation on those elements because if we don't get those more efficient, we will not be able to deliver on the target of 24GW. So a combination of more sites, simpler processes and more enabling regulation are really, really important.",
            "On prospects of new sites for nuclear in the UK",
            "We are looking at acquiring access to the existing sites for the SMR programme, sites like Oldbury, Wylfa, Heysham, Hartlepool and the others within the existing policy statement. Those are recognised nuclear sites which we can build on at scale - the SMR programme is all about scale and getting as quickly as we can to deliver on energy security and on the journey to net-zero. The views of the wider nuclear population are really important though, because when you look at AMRs, then if you get things like passive safety approved - walk-away safe - on a number of the AMR technologies, the sites that gives you access to is so much broader. And therefore things like the old industrial sites become more readily accessible because they will very likely be in a different regulatory regime, or modified regulatory regime, because the planning zones are going to be so much smaller. So a more flexible approach to allow the private sector to identify these sites where they know they've got the demand that will justify their business case, and a combination of that plus an enhanced regulatory regime, or a modified regulatory regime, for the different types of plants, all of that will start to open up more sites and therefore more output.",
            "Will GBN be involved in the private-sector led initiatives?",
            "When we did the scoping work for GBN, the very clear advice from all of the nuclear systems around the UK, around the world, was that you really do need a government programme, a government-led programme, an underwritten programme to rejuvenate the nuclear industry and get it started again. And that's exactly why GBN has been set up. What that doesn't do for one minute is preclude private developers developing their own projects, and we would want to encourage it. The only reason we haven't done that so far, is just bandwidth. Let's get set up on the journey to energy security and net-zero through the SMR programme, and now we're in a place where we want to really understand when developers tell us that they don't need any support from government, they don't need any money from the government, well tell us more about that, because we really want to understand it. Having market-led projects will absolutely allow the government to fulfill one of its aims, which is to get as much of this off the government balance sheet and out of the public finances as possible. So the sooner we can do that the better and therefore alternative routes to market and market-led projects are one of the major routes through which you'll deliver that. Our level of support would depend on the level of support they suggest - in the short term I think it is highly likely that we would be, as a very minimum, providing a supporting role.",
            "On the current state of the SMR contest",
            "I prefer to refer to it as a selection process because although they might be competing, we're selecting what we need. The first thing to say is that we're delighted that we got six highly credible technologies that have come forward and want to be part of our process, which is great. We are at the final stages now (11 January, 2024) of preparing and getting the approvals for the invitation to submit an initial tender document. This is the next stage where all six companies will engage with our contractual documentation in terms of how we think it should be structured. They'll submit the responses in their initial tender, we will then go through a process to down-select to around about four with the aim to be placing contracts later in the year. That process is ongoing, I think the main thing that we are very focused on is absolutely on pace, because we need to move quickly from an energy security point of view and from an international market point of view, but what I'm not prepared to do from the GBN board perspective, is trade pace for rigour. Because rigour in the procurement process can be very, very important. So we are in continual conversations at a board level to say, ‘right, ok, are we really ready to go, do we really have a good understanding of the documents, how they fit together’ because at a point where that's the case then we'll release them. I'm delighted about where we've got to, we've got a great team of people ... we’ve got the right people around the table in terms of the vendors and we have got a mass of stuff to do this year because once we've got the tenders out, we've then got to start pulling together what the development companies might look like.",
            "The tender is for the technology all the way through to completion of the regulatory process and final design and completion of design, with then the potential to place a contract. We need an entity that is going to develop the site, a development company, and because we're looking at hopefully more than one technology that we'll be developing, we will be highly likely to be having to pull together more than one development company who will characterise the site, apply for the the consent and the environmental permit, and the nuclear site licence, and then manage the construction and move into operation - and the scale of those is probably about the size of a FTSE 100 company, each one. So these are massive undertakings and we've got all of that to do. It is a hugely exciting time, but actually pretty daunting as well at the same time.",
            "How many of the contenders are likely to be selected?",
            "The initial down-select will be from six to around about four, depending on how things go, and then the documentation says between one and four will be awarded a contract. I think the optimum number is somewhere between two and three, but we will be retaining our optionality and there are some important conversations for us to have with government and the Treasury to determine what, in the policy space, they they are prepared to support.",
            "Will each one chosen be tied to a specific site",
            "At the point where we place the contracts, we will have identified and acquired access to the site. And we will match sites to technology and those sites will have the scale to be able to build multiple SMRs of that technology at that site. So the likelihood is it will be one, two or three in the first stage but then being very clear that if these are successful, as we hope they will be, and they can demonstrate that their costs are going to come down with the second, third and fourth units, and we can convince ourselves it's value for money, then we want to just continue building on those sites. As we've learned internationally, that is the right thing to do ... again subject to the final stages approval, our current view is that we will be placing contracts for more than one (reactor) because what we have to demonstrate is that modularisation works and therefore the investment that is required to build the modular factories.",
            "Will Wylfa be available for SMRs?",
            "I think there is a quite a big policy decision for us to make, which has not been yet made, which is, with the announcement that we are going to explore building another gigawatt scale plant after Sizewell, we've got to be clear about whether we are going to look to identify another site for that, or whether that site should be Wylfa. So there is a debate about whether Wylfa is used for SMRs or gigawatt. Therefore that will drive when we look to acquire access to it.",
            "Is Final Investment Decision still targeted for 2029?",
            "Yes, at the latest 2029. If we could do it before that, then, of course we will.",
            "There's an election coming in the UK, will politics derail plans?",
            "I am very confident that the UK political parties are committed to nuclear being a critical part of baseload power, because every nation that has nuclear capabilities worldwide thinks the same. And the COP28 declaration where 20+ countries have said we’ll triple nuclear by 2050 is massively important for us, so from a macro sense, I think we are in great shape. We've never been in better shape for nuclear, cross-party, I don't think that we will skip a beat in intent. Of course, when there is a change of party, then there is bound to be a little bit of a hiatus as the new team get their feet under the desk and determine how they want to apply their fiscal priorities. Therefore I think the risk is more of scale and pace than whether we do or don't have a nuclear programme. If I was asked to bet money on it I would say that we'll continue with the scale and the pace that we've set out so far, because actually there is no alternative.",
            "General global outlook for nuclear",
            "I think it mirrors what I've just said about the UK - that COP28 declaration was a very important moment in the international nuclear industry and it is one industry, you know, this is not a  national industry where you can draw boundaries. Everything we do is international. Now what does that mean? Well, it's a good news/bad news story.The brilliant news is that we will, as an industry, have the opportunity to grow multiple technologies at multiple scales. And all learn from each other. Having moved out of the nuclear industry and come back into it, the thing I love about the industry is everybody wants to learn from everybody else. I've never seen an industry where people have the thirst for learning off each other and are prepared to share. It is almost unique in that sense, so the opportunity to learn and therefore all accelerate and therefore all contribute to combating climate change and net-zero is just hugely compelling and a great opportunity. So on one hand, I'm just very, very proud to be part of that because I think it's got huge potential. The bad side is there's a global demand for capability. And everywhere you look, we all want very similar skills, so although, the nuclear specialist skills are somewhere between 10 and 20% of what we need, the 70/80/90% of the skills we need are skills that can be employed in infrastructure, in carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and petrochem. It is a massive market that we're competing with and it’s a global market. So that's the challenge. It is hugely compelling and with massive opportunities, we have really got to get our act together in terms of skills and capability to understand how we're going to deliver on our ambitions globally, and critically, nationally.",
            "What industry can do to help with nuclear's expansion plans",
            "I think the first thing is we've got to act as one industry - unless we share skills and we find mechanisms for sharing skills across the nuclear sector, both in defence and civil and across the boundaries then it's going to be very, very difficult to succeed. I think the other thing is that the private sector, and I can say this because I'm still part of it, we have got as many signals as we need now to invest. We've got to get on with raising the cash to invest in the infrastructure and the skills and the capability that are required. So waiting for a starting gun any longer isn't going to work. That starting gun's been fired. And these announcements are part of that, so, I think we've all just got to trust in the fact that absolutely, this is going to happen, it's got to happen, and we need to be prepared with the right capability and the right capacity ... it's now up to us to deliver.",

            "Investment in and development of renewable energy projects should take priority over small modular reactors (SMRs) because they are reliable, according to US-based think tank the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).",
            "IEEFA conducts research relating to economic and environmental issues with the goal of accelerating the transition to renewable energy. Its report, Small Modular Reactors: Still too expensive, too slow and too risky, says utilities should be required to assess how competitive SMRs are versus renewables.",

            "“Significant construction delays are still the norm and costs have continued to climb.”",
            "It goes on to make the argument that renewables should be invested in faster, and SMRs should be left behind, to help in the transition away from fossil fuels.",

            "The think tank believes that regulators should impose “restrictions to prevent delays and cost increases” on the developers of small modular SMRs.",
            "IEEFA energy analyst and co-author of the report Dennis Wamsted said: “The comparison between building new SMRs and building renewable energy couldn’t be clearer.",

            "Its report echoes that of the Parliamentary Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) which, earlier this year, wrote an open letter to energy secretary Claire Coutinho expressing concern about how reliant the UK’s decarbonisation strategy is on the deployment of SMRs. The EAC said that many of the advertised benefits of SMRs are either half-truths or unproven and the timescale for their deployment is likely to be longer than currently anticipated.",

        "title": "Great British Nuclear launched with SMR competition and £157M nuclear funding package",
        "text": [
            "The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) is today launching Great British Nuclear (GBN), the new government body that will be the delivery vehicle for all of the UK’s nuclear projects, including Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C.",
            "According to DESNZ: “GBN will drive the rapid expansion of new nuclear power plants in the UK at an unprecedented scale and pace.",
            "“This will boost UK energy security, reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel imports, create more affordable power and grow the economy, with the nuclear industry estimated to generate around £6bn for the UK economy.”",
            "DESNZ added that GBN will play a key role in helping the government hit its ambition to provide up to a quarter of the UK’s electricity from homegrown nuclear energy by 2050.",
            "GBN’s official launch is supported by a competition for organisations to bid for funding support for the development of their nuclear products, including small modular reactors (SMRs).",
            "Current SMR projects include Rolls-Royce SMR proposals looking at constructing reactors in Oldbury and Berkeley in the south west of England and Balfour Beatty's proposals with Holtec Britain to develop plans for a SMR-160 pressurised light-water reactor somewhere in the UK.",
            "Once the initial stage of the SMR selection process is complete, GBN will down-select those technologies which have met the criteria and then enter into detailed discussions with those companies as part of an Invitation to Negotiate phase. The initial down-select will take place this autumn.",
            "Further to the competition, the government is also announcing a £157M grant funding package for nuclear projects alongside the launch of GBN. Details of how it will be spent are below.",
            "GBN will initially be led by Simon Bowen and Gwen Parry-Jones as interim chair and chief executive officer respectively.",
            "Energy security and net zero secretary Grant Shapps said: “Britain has a rich history as a pioneer of nuclear power, having launched the era of civil nuclear power - and I’m proud to be turbocharging its revival and placing our country once again at the forefront of global innovation.",
            "“By rapidly boosting our homegrown supply of nuclear and other clean, reliable, and abundant energy, we will drive down bills for British homes and make sure the UK is never held to energy ransom by tyrants like Putin.",
            "“Today, as we open GBN and the competition to develop cutting-edge small modular reactor technology, which could result in billions of pounds of public and private sector investment, we are seeing the first brush strokes of our nuclear power renaissance to power up Britain and grow our economy for decades to come.”",
            "Minister for nuclear Andrew Bowie said: “As long-standing pioneers of nuclear, today we’re marking its UK revival with the opening of GBN, which will play an essential role in transforming the way we power Britain from Britain.",
            "“I look forward to seeing the world-class designs submitted from all around the world through the competitive selection process, as the UK takes its place front and centre in the global race to unleash a new generation of nuclear technology.”",
            "GBN interim chair Simon Bowen said: “GBN is core to delivering the government’s new nuclear programme.",
            "“Building on the work done at Hinkley Point and Sizewell, today’s announcement of the start of the SMR selection process signifies a real step forward in delivering the scale of nuclear power that Britain needs for secure, sustainable energy future.",
            "“We look forward to working with all interested parties – technology vendors, the supply chain, the wider industry and local communities as we move this essential programme forward.”",
            "Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit head of energy Jess Ralston said:",
            "“A number of experts, including the Climate Change Committee, see a role for nuclear in removing gas from our power system, but with SMRs yet to be deployed and larger plants like Hinkley over-budget and delayed, it’s difficult to predict exactly what the costs and timescales might be for future endeavours. The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the high upfront costs of nuclear could leave us with a £170bn bill.",
            "“Despite slight cost increases given current inflation levels, British renewables will remain much cheaper than both gas and nuclear. There are questions over whether Government has taken its eye off the ball for the current Contracts for Difference auction round for wind farms, imposing too tight restrictions and so limiting the projects that might get built. Where Government places its focus is important for green investment from businesses, and clearly rapidly building out renewables is the best deal for the UK tax or billpayer.”",
            "Atkins nuclear and power managing director Chris Conboy said: ",
            "“Today’s GB Nuclear launch is an important milestone towards establishing the critical role that nuclear will have in the UK’s net zero future. The support for small modular reactor projects should accelerate the development of technologies that have the potential to provide greater energy resilience and deliver clean, affordable power. This positive support for new technologies and investment in domestic fuel manufacture capability sits alongside a welcome continued commitment to largescale nuclear through the progress already made at Hinkley Point C and a future plant at Sizewell C. The Government’s ambition to deliver a quarter of the country’s electricity from nuclear will be achieved through the safe, efficient, cost-effective and timely delivery of new build projects, and we look forward to playing a role in engineering a nuclear-fuelled future for the UK.”",
            "BDB Pitmans partner and parliamentary agent Mustafa Latif-Aramesh said:",
            "“Today is a significant day for nuclear in the UK. The release of funding, which had been delayed, will mean that the Government is finally putting money where its mouth is for Small and Advanced Nuclear Reactors. That technology is urgently required both for energy resilience and in order to allow the UK to meet its decarbonisation targets.",
            "“The announcement should be accompanied by a renewed focus on publishing details on siting arrangements, and confirmation on Great British Nuclear’s remit in being a partner at the development phase. Government should throw resources at updating the National Policy Statement for Nuclear in advance of their 2025 target, and confirming that nuclear projects outside of existing or decommissioned nuclear sites can progress so that the private sector can deliver clean energy in tandem with GBN’s competition processes.”",
            "Turner & Townsend director and head of UK natural resources Alan Sinclair commented:",
            "“The success of Great British Nuclear will rely on three major components: attracting investment, spurring innovation and building skills.  Lack of certainty has dogged the sector for over a decade and both investors and the supply chain are looking for a clear break from the past.  Get it right and the UK has the potential to tackle emissions and energy independence, while also establishing the foundations for a world-class industry with expertise that can be exported abroad.",
            "“Providing 24Gw of generation by 2050 is a gargantuan task and clarity over financing is the first priority.  The £20bn committed directly from Government for SMRs can kick-start the private investment that will be needed and galvanise not just operators, but also the supply chain required to build and manage these new sites.  SMRs bring a greater opportunity for off-site design and construction, and a reduced reliance on supporting infrastructure on a massive scale.  However, shaping the supply chain to support these changes in the UK’s approach will take time and careful capacity planning.",
            "“People will be crucial to success.  The requirements across defence and energy taken together amount to upwards of 250,000 roles.  That is a major undertaking in its own right and GBN will need to draw on the UK’s existing pools of talent from the energy and infrastructure sector if it is to succeed.  Above all, we need to be keenly aware that the UK is competing in a global market for talent.",
            "“Expertise in new methods of generation also needs to be matched by equivalent investment across the nuclear lifecycle - for decommissioning and waste storage - so that the industry remains self-sustaining long-term.”",
            "Balfour Beatty Group chief executive Leo Quinn said:",
            "“Great British Nuclear represents a gear change in how we power the country’s homes and businesses.",
            "“Nuclear energy is a clear and proven route to secure clean, homegrown energy – removing the reliance on costly imports. The construction and infrastructure industry continues to deliver on Hinkley Point C and is ready to get started on Sizewell C. In doing so, we can reduce energy bills, lower carbon emissions, create thousands of jobs – including apprenticeships – and cement Britain’s position as a leader in clean energy.”",
            "Stop Sizewell C, a campaign group against the nuclear reactor, said: ",
            "“The postponed relaunch of GBN - which is neither Great, nor really British - contains no more than a wing and a prayer for Sizewell C.",
            "“No vote of confidence can help Sizewell C unless it has a big fat cheque attached, and the money announced today - which is all earmarked for other projects - is, in the context of expensive nuclear energy, chicken feed.”",
            "The £157M nuclear funding package has been separated as follows",
            "£77.1M of funding will be provided to companies to accelerate advanced nuclear business development in the UK and support advanced nuclear designs to enter UK regulations",
            "£58M funding will go to the further development and design of a type of advanced modular reactor (AMR) and next generation fuel. AMRs operate at a higher temperature than SMRs and as a result they could provide high temperature heat for hydrogen and other industrial uses alongside nuclear power.",
            "Of this the winning projects of this phase of funding are:",
            "The Ultra Safe Nuclear Corporation UK in Warrington which will receive £22.5M to further develop the design of a high temperature micro modular reactor, a type of AMR suited to UK industrial demands including hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel production.",
            "£15M will go to the National Nuclear laboratory in Warrington to accelerate the design of a high temperature reactor, following its success in Japan.",
            "The National Nuclear Laboratory in Preston will receive £16M to continue to develop sovereign coated particle fuel capability, a type of robust advanced fuel which is suitable for high temperature reactors.",
            "A further £22.3M from the Nuclear Fuel Fund will enable eight projects to develop new fuel production and manufacturing capabilities in the UK, driving up energy security and supporting the global move away from Russian fuel.",
            "The winning projects of this fund are:",
            "£10.5M will go to Westinghouse Springfields nuclear fuel plant in Preston to manufacture more innovative types of nuclear fuel for customers both in the UK and overseas, boosting jobs and skills in the North West.",
            "£9.5M to Urenco UK in Capenhurst Chester, an international supplier of nuclear materials, to enrich uranium to higher levels, including low enriched uranium (LEU+) and high assay low enriched uranium. LEU+ will allow for current reactors and SMRs to run for longer between refuelling outages."

        "text": [
            "Chancellor Jeremey Hunt has announced the government will be consulting on listing nuclear energy as “environmentally sustainable” in a bid to increase private investment in the sector.",
            "Announced during today’s Spring Budget statement, Hunt stated nuclear was a “critical source of cheap and reliable energy” to meeting the UK’s net zero obligations.",
            "On the reclassification of nuclear energy, government’s budget document states: “Nuclear energy will also be included in the green taxonomy, subject to consultation, encouraging private investment.”",
            "In his speech, Hunt said: “Because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine, even under the conservatives, we will need another critical source of cheap, reliable energy and that is nuclear.",
            "“Increasing nuclear capacity is vital to meet our net zero obligations, so to encourage private sector investment into our nuclear programme, I confirm, subject to consultation, nuclear power will be classed as environmentally sustainable.",
            "“That will give an access to the same investment incentives as renewable energy and alongside that will come more public investment.”",
            "The change of classification has not been welcomed by Stop Sizewell C, a campaign group against the facility, which called the change a “nonsense of the science”.",
            "A spokesperson for Stop Sizewell C added: \"The chancellor announcing that nuclear will be included in the 'green' taxonomy makes a nonsense of the promised consultation and a nonsense of the science, given the major issue of radioactive waste. In any case this seems unlikely to sway wary UK investors, for despite government support, Sizewell C is not expected to reach a final investment decision for two years - if ever - and remains a risky project with a flawed reactor design.",
            "The announcement about the reclassification was made as part of the government's commitment to for Great British Nuclear (GBN) as a new industry body and Hunt said that the first focus of GBN will be to launch a competition to develop small modular reactor (SMR) projects.",
            "On the subject of SMRs, Hunt said in his budget speech: \"I am launching the first competition for Small Modular Reactors. It will be completed by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable, we will co-fund this exciting new technology.\"",
            "The competition seeking companies to develop SMRs was announced on 10 March by the newly formed GBN. This new government body has been set up as a delivery vehicle for all of the UK’s nuclear projects, including Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C.",
            "Current SMR projects include Rolls-Royce SMR proposals looking at constructing reactors in Oldbury and Berkeley in the south west of England and Balfour Beatty's proposals with Holtec Britain to develop plans for a SMR-160 pressurised light-water reactor somewhere in the UK.",
            "A spokesperson for Rolls-Royce SMR said: “Rolls-Royce SMR has secured funding commitments of £490M and is the only SMR technology moving through the UKs regulatory process. We have over 600 members of staff in the UK, dedicated to bringing our technology to market at pace – a British solution to a global energy crisis.",
            "“Rolls-Royce SMR has called for rapid progress from the government and we welcome the adoption of that principle in this process, the launch of GBN and the certainty it will provide for future projects.",
            "“We look forward to working collaboratively with government and GBN to realise their ambitions as quickly as possible.”",
            "The official budget document states the competition “is expected to attract the best designs from both domestic and international vendors. The government’s ambition is to select the leading technologies by the end of this year and if demonstrated to be viable, co-fund this exciting new technology in the UK.”",
            "Welsh Affairs Committee chair Stephen Crabb MP believes today’s announcements will help to “reassure” the sector and hopes they are a sign the Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station will soon get the green light.",
            "He said: “The chancellor has today given a vote of confidence in nuclear energy. The establishment of GBN – following my recent letter calling for it and on the back of evidence to our committee – will reassure the sector. I hope this is a sign that Wylfa may be given the green light sooner rather than later for a GW scale site.",
            "“There are two potential sites in Wales for small modular reactors, at Wylfa and Trawsfynydd, and I hope these projects are considered for Great British Nuclear’s upcoming competition.",
            "“I also welcome the decision to include nuclear energy in the UK’s green taxonomy, subject to consultation, as this reflects the views expressed to our committee.”",
            "Crabb called for more clarity on what the situation with the proposed nuclear project in Anglesey, Wales was a week ago.",
            "Stop Sizewell C was not supportive of the launch of GBN though. Its spokesperson added: \"There's woefully little information about GBN, or its financial clout, but the UK government's recent affirmation of how intertwined civil and defence 'nuclear enterprises' are and commitment to align these raises serious questions about GBN's role, and the government's previously unspoken motivations behind its civil nuclear ambitions.\"",
            "A spokesperson for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) said: “Last year, the government announced that the NDA would support interested parties to enable engagement on land within the NDA estate which has the potential to host the UK’s next generation of nuclear power stations. This work is consistent with our mission to clean up the UK’s earliest nuclear sites safely, securely and cost-effectively and, in line with our obligation under the Energy Act, to release the land for other uses that benefit the local community and the environment.",
            "“Of course our primary focus is the decommissioning of existing nuclear facilities across the UK, but we also have an important role to play in supporting the UK government to achieve its energy security strategy ambitions and we will engage with GBN and other interested parties to help deliver this.”"

            "Hunt said in a statement that the UK is in need of a “reset” and part of the reason the government is keen to invest in cleaner energy is to stop a spike in household energy bills, like the one the UK faced following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",
            "He said: “We don’t want to see high bills like this again, it’s time for a clean energy reset. That is why we are fully committing to nuclear power in the UK, backing a new generation of small modular reactors, and investing tens of billions in clean energy through carbon capture.”",
            "The Treasury has said Hunt intends to announce an “unprecedented investment” of £20bn over the next 20 years for carbon capture and low carbon energy projects in response to Joe Biden’s $369bn (£306bn) of climate subsidies for the United States.",
            "A number of carbon capture projects currently awaiting government approval are expected to get the green light on Wednesday (15 March).

This had been made possible by DOE financing and support, including loan guarantees. It said the US Government “will continue to take action to enable first movers to deploy advanced and innovative technologies” building on actions that have already been taken.",

            "The White House also noted the actions it is taking to support the demonstration and deployment of new nuclear technologies. These include DOE’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, and a Congressional appropriations package providing $800m to fund up to two SMR demonstration projects, the implementation of which will be announced later this year. It also highlighted work by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline the licensing process for building new reactors and life extensions and capacity expansions of existing reactors, and initiatives to develop the nuclear supply chain and workforce, including the recently signed Prohibiting Russian Uranium Imports Act.",
            "“Taken together, these actions represent the largest sustained push to accelerate civil nuclear deployment in the United States in nearly five decades,” the White House said.",
            "Lightbridge CEO Seth Grae, who attended the summit, said the Administration’s initiatives “are a significant step forward in revitalizing the domestic nuclear sector and ensuring that nuclear energy remains a vital part of our clean energy future”.",
            "During the summit, Duke Energy, Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nucor announced agreements to explore new and innovative approaches to support carbon-free energy generation and help utilities serve the future energy needs of large businesses in North Carolina and South Carolina.",
            "In memoranda of understanding signed earlier in May, the companies proposed developing new rate structures, known as “tariffs” in the utility industry, designed specifically to lower the long-term costs of investing in clean energy technologies such as new nuclear and long-duration storage through early commitments. The proposed Accelerating Clean Energy (ACE) tariffs would enable large customers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nucor to directly support carbon-free energy generation investments through innovative financing structures and contributions that address project risk to lower costs of emerging technologies.",
            "ACE tariffs would facilitate beneficial on-site generation at customer facilities, participation in load flexibility programs and investments in clean energy assets – features attractive to customers with large-scale energy needs. The ACE framework also would include a Clean Transition Tariff (CTT) – the key feature enabling Duke Energy to provide individualised portfolios of new carbon-free energy to commercial and industrial customers."

        "title": "A global pipeline to power for SMRs",
        "text": [
            "Impressive recent growth in the SMR project pipeline is just one more element of a tidal wave forming for the next great nuclear breakthrough.",
            "In the first quarter of 2024 the small nuclear reactor (SMR) project pipeline reached 22 GW. This, according to a new report from analytics firm Wood Mackenzie, represents growth of some 65% in the three years since 2021.",
            "Noting that just five countries lead the project pipeline – Canada, the Korean Republic, Poland, the United Kingdom, and the United States are driving some 58% of those projects – the WoodMac analysis adds that even the current global project pipeline would require an investment of close to US$176bn.",
            "It’s clearly a substantial growth rate and is backed by serious investment, even if the whole extent of the current pipeline never reaches a positive final investment decision. And it’s a district possibility, if not outright probability, that such a situation may come to pass as some of these projects fall by the wayside. After all, there are obvious risks to consider, particularly in light of the high profile NuScale retrenchment. As an industry leader – and still the only SMR design to receive approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission – NuScale had been widely seen as something of a flag-bearer for this burgeoning new nuclear industry.",
            "It’s understandable then that the decision to abandon the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) being developed in partnership with Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS) was taken by many as a significant blow to the credibility of SMRs as a whole.",
            "However, to reach that conclusion would undoubtedly be an ill-considered approach. NuScale may have taken a step backwards, but it is hardly in full-blown retreat. Almost immediately after the CFPP decision was announced Standard Power revealed plans to work with NuScale to develop two SMR-powered facilities in Ohio and Pennsylvania. The Standard business is as a provider of services to data companies and this may be taken as a giant neon sign pointing to at least one of the underlying drivers behind a global SMR boom. The unabated growth of energy-hungry data centres is likely to see an early and productive partnership between the two industries. They certainly won’t be alone though, given Microsoft founder Bill Gates is also the founder of Terrapower with its 345 MWe Natrium sodium-cooled fast reactor technology.",
            "There’s other clear evidence of gathering momentum behind an SMR-led nuclear market too. With multiple policy initiatives reflecting a new appraisal of nuclear in general, there are also SMR-specific government-backed measures designed to push SMR technologies off the drawing board and into operation. Important regulatory efforts underway include the US NRC, the UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) recently signing a trilateral deal to collaborate on SMR and advanced modular reactor (AMR) design assessment. The agreement is designed to enable both good practice and experience of reviewing SMR/AMR designs to be shared between the regulators. All three bodies are already engaged with SMR design assessment – the NRC is conducting pre-application activities with Westinghouse regarding design certification for its AP300 SMR, as well as with Holtec International for its SMR 300, and GE-Hitachi Nuclear for licensing approval of its BWRX-300 design, for example. This new measure marks an important step toward a unified regulatory framework that is so important to the success of SMRs that are expected to be deployed in many different jurisdictions.",
            "Given the underlying fundamentals it’s perhaps not so surprising that in their net zero scenario, WoodMac sees SMRs accounting for around a third of the global nuclear fleet. It’s not a cloudless horizon, inevitably there are both economic and technical risks and challenges that must be overcome and to do so will require a long-term concerted effort from government, regulators and the private sector. But taken in the round there is every indication that the 65% growth in the project pipeline seen over the last three years will come to be regarded as a pretty poor show in the years that follow."

            "Above: Palisades operators train on the reconstituted control room simulator in preparation for plant restart (courtesy of Holtec)",
            "US-based Holtec International has announced “remarkable progress made in the early stages of our journey toward repowering the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert Township, Michigan”. This includes re-establishment of critical plant workforce, revitalized training programmes, procurement of numerous plant systems and components, significant regulatory developments, and continuing firming up of funding streams – “all of which portend a timely re-powering of the plant”.",
            "The single-unit 800 MWe pressurised water reactor at Palisades NPP began commercial operation in 1971. Operator Entergy announced in 2016 announced plans to close the plant in 2021 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) approved transfer of the licence from Entergy to Holtec in preparation for its decommissioning. The reactor was removed from service by Entergy in May 2022, and defuelled. Its sale to Holtec was completed in June 2022 and Holtec then announced that it was applying for federal funding to allow restart of the plant.",
            "In April, the US Department of Energy (DOE) through its Loan Programs Office (LPO) has announced the offer of a conditional commitment of up to $1.52bn as a loan guarantee to restart the 800 MWe Palisades NPP in Michigan. The project aims to bring back online the Palisades plant, which ceased operations in May 2022, and to upgrade it to produce power until at least 2051, subject to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing approvals. With the conditional commitment from LPO as well as the critical financial support from both the State of Michigan and Holtec, the company says it is “on track to accelerate the tempo for a successful restart of Palisades”.",
            "More than 360 Holtec associates are now employed at the plant, an increase of nearly 150 personnel since the re-start programme began. Holtec says it has “successfully executed a recommissioning labour agreement with 15 trade unions that are supporting the project, reinforcing our commitment to collaboration with unionised labour, fair labour practices, and the highest standards of quality and safety”.",
            "Another achievement is the re-establishment of the Palisades training programme under the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations to establish a highly skilled workforce for the plant’s operation. “The reconstitution of the plant’s Control Room Simulator and restoration of Operator training programme are both complete and the Training Building, which had been mothballed for future demolition, is now a bustling hub of industry veterans and talented new associates,” Holtec notes. As a result, 26 Palisades Licensed Operators are currently completing requalification classes to maintain their federal operating licences and two initial Operator classes are underway, with a third to begin later this year. This “sets the stage for imminent restoration of Palisades Maintenance and Technical training programmes”.",
            "Major plant work being undertaken is also underway to ensure safety for the plant’s extended operational life, including offsite refurbishment of the generator exciter and restoration of reactor vessel’s operational integrity in preparation for a deep chemical cleaning of the plant’s reactor cooling system.",
            "The near future will see inspection of the reactor vessel internals and steam generators along with long-term investments in preventive maintenance, equipment repairs, replacements, upgrades, and modifications, as part of the site’s robust restart project plan. Other critical activities, such as the ordering of new fuel for the reactor and long-lead part procurement, are also underway.",
            "With respect to regulation, significant progress has been made towards reauthorisation of extended operations. This includes submitting five of the major licensing submittals to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and engaging in public meetings as a part of that process. NRC has been notified of Holtec’s intention to pursue subsequent licence renewal to extend the plant’s operational life.",
            "Holtec says it has also made headway in plans to site Holtec’s first two small modular reactors (SMRs) adjacent to the Palisades plant. “When constructed, our twin SMR-300 reactors, which are designed to produce a minimum of 300-megwatts power per unit, will nearly double the Michigan site’s total carbon-free generation capacity. Preliminary siting activities are underway with filing of the Construction Permit Application for the two SMRs targeted for 2026.”"

            "US company Holtec International has established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Holtec Maintenance & Modification International (HMI), with the initial focus being the restart of the Palisades NPP.",
            "Holtec said the mission of HMI is “to meet the time-critical maintenance and modification needs of the world’s operating nuclear power plants with assured performance certainty”. HMI “is poised to introduce cutting edge technologies such as AI-aided preventive maintenance and robot-led crew radiation dose reduction methods at its clients’ plants”. According to Holtec, “the resulting structured operational platform, which HMI calls its ‘transformative management model’, is at the core of HMI’s vision to energise the presently placid business sector of modification and maintenance that is widely considered to have suffered from lack of technology and capital infusion”.",
            "Holtec believes the HMI management model “will bring about a vastly improved control of operating costs of nuclear plants and ensure heightened plant reliability, which will support the expected renaissance in nuclear generation around the world”. HMI is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee and led by Christopher Bakken IV. HMI will operate under its parent company programmes on nuclear quality assurance, environmental protection, personnel safety assurance, Corporate Governance, and supply management, but will be otherwise autonomous in its conduct of business.",
            "“HMI’s initial project is to help accelerate the ongoing rejuvenation of the Palisades plant, owned by the Holtec subsidiary Palisades Energy LLC (PEL), to restart the 840 MWe plant in Covert, Michigan,” said Bakken IV. “Discussions with other clients in the US and overseas are underway.” PEL President Kelly Trice said: “We look to Chris and his team to render their professional magic to accelerate Palisades ongoing extended outage underpinned by Holtec’s world class quality assurance to help us achieve a successful re-powering of the Palisades by the end of 2025.”",
            "Holtec agreed to purchase Palisades from operator Entergy in 2018, ahead of its scheduled closure, for decommissioning. When the acquisition was completed in June 2022, Holtec planned to complete the dismantling, decontamination, and remediation of the plant by 2041. However, Holtec then announced plans to apply for federal funding to enable it to reopen the plant, with support from Michigan Governor Gretchen. The State of Michigan's Fiscal Year 2024 budget, provides $150m in funding towards the plant's restart. In March, the US Department of Energy Loan Programs Office also conditionally committed up to $1.52bn for a loan guarantee to support the project to bring the Palisades plant back online by the end of 2025. Holtec has also said it intends to locate its first two small modular reactor (SMR) units at Palisades.",
            "HMI will collaborate closely with the Company’s Nuclear Power Division (NPD) to provide replacement components and systems – reverse engineered as necessary to replace obsolescent items – to meet target outage schedules. NPD’s highly regarded Site Services Group, which prepares procedures, computer simulations and document packages for plant modification will serve as a valuable partner to HMI. “With the launch of HMI, we can now provide an integrated capability to meet the operating needs of the scores of SMR-300 plants that we hope to be building in the US and around the world,“ said Dr Rick Springman, Holtec’s President of Global Clean Energy Opportunities.",

        "text": [
            "Rolls-Royce SMR has reportedly revised its plans to build two nuclear factories in the UK due ongoing delays in the government’s small modular reactor (SMR) design competition. In December 2023, six SMR designs were selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK The winning bidders were EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK The contracts were expected to be awarded in spring 2024 but this has now been postponed to June 2024 at the earliest.",
            "Rolls-Royce had planned two separate factories: one for heavy pressure vessels, critical components for reactors, and another for assembling the modular units of the SMRs. A shortlist for the pressure vessel factory included the International Advanced Manufacturing Park on the outskirts of Sunderland, as well as the Gateway industrial park in Deeside, Wales.",
            "However, Rolls-Royce says it no longer has time to build it and make the first pressure vessels by the early 2030s when it had hoped to launch its first SMRs. Rolls-Royce will now buy its heavy pressure vessels from a third-party supplier. Plans for the second factory will still go ahead. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce SMR told the Daily Telegraph that the company had now “prioritised work on our modules assembly and test facility”. It added: “Our efforts are focused on identifying the best site to support our deployment at pace.”",
            "The sites considered for the pressure vessel factory could now be shortlisted for the second plant, but no decision has yet been made. The company may revive plans for a heavy pressure vessel factory sometime in the future, provided that it manages to build up a robust pipeline of orders. A UK government spokesman said: “Our world leading SMR competition aims to be the fastest of its kind, helping secure billions in investment for the UK, meaning cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy in the long-term.”",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWt. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK.",

The nuclear qualification came after an American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III Division I NCA 3300 (NCA 3800), NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations.",
            "Ian Nicholls, group technical director, at Sheffield Forgemasters, said, “We undertook the ASME audit in November and have now received confirmation that the audit recommendation has been approved by the committee. The accreditation is a huge development with heightened requirements and protocols embracing all our processes, employees and selected sub-suppliers.”",
            "The qualification followed the company’s announcement of a ground-breaking development in the acceleration of welding for large nuclear vessels, using Electron Beam Welding to reduce more than a year’s worth of manual welding to less than 24 hours. In February Sheffield Forgemasters completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW).",
            "Nicholls added: “The ASME accreditation, coupled with our development of Electron Beam Welding for large diameter, nuclear grade vessels, places Sheffield Forgemasters at the pinnacle of development for small modular reactors and presents significant possibilities for the UK’s domestic nuclear new-build programme.”",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters is the only company in the UK capable of manufacturing reactor vessel components for SMRs, and this together with the ASME status, gives the company capability in delivery of advanced power-generation technology. As well as being the sole UK supplier of large, nuclear-grade forgings and castings, Sheffield Forgemasters’ MO and NPT status now makes it one of the only UK companies qualified for fabrication of the main components within a civil NPP.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters. which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, first gained ASME accreditation as a Nuclear Materials Organisation in 1992 but it had lapsed, with the lack of nuclear new-build in subsequent years. The ASME code is the most comprehensive series of guidelines for civil nuclear manufacture in the world with an emphasis on doctrines that have parallels with the European Nuclear manufacturing code, RCC-M, and other submarine nuclear standards.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK. Under the MOU, X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK.",
            "Earlier, in February 2023, the company signed an MOU with with Holtec Britain to design components for Holtec’s SMR-160 SMR and identify the best routes to manufacture. This followed similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, Sheffield Forgemasters and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 Sheffield Forgemasters signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK."

            "The April 2023 agreement sought to pave the way for up to 20 Holtec SMR-160 units to be deployed in Ukraine. Holtec says its SMR has since undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system for the SMR-300. This is a pressurised water reactor producing around 300 MWe or 1050 MWt for process applications.",
            "Halushchenko noted: “Establishing in-country manufacturing capabilities for the nuclear energy sector would not only contribute to the strengthening of the country’s energy security, but would also allow Ukraine to become a global leader in the field of nuclear energy. The document will enable Ukraine “to become a regional hub for manufacturing, exports, training, and deployment of SMRs and for managing used fuel produced by our operating reactors while also accruing the multiple benefits of economic development and jobs creation and decarbonization and promotion of green energy future”.",

            "Holtec Britain has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with South Korea’s Hyundai E&C and UK construction and engineering companies Balfour Beatty, and Mott MacDonald. The event was hosted at the Korean Embassy in London by Ambassador Yoon Yeocheol and attended by UK Prime Minister’s Trade Envoy to Korea, Sir John Whittingdale MP.",
            "The partnerships are a further step towards delivery of Holtec’s SMR-300 technology in the UK. The SMR-300 is a pressurised water reactor (PWR) using technology based on existing standards in the US and UK and uses PWR fuel similar to that already used at Sizewell B, and other new UK reactors under development including Hinkley Point C. Holtec has been developing its SMR since 2011. The SMR-300 has undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "In December 2023, Holtec Britain was awarded £30m ($37.6m) of grant funding from the UK government’s Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to complete Generic Design Assessment (GDA) of the SMR-300, which was also shortlisted by Great British Nuclear (GBN) at the end of October 2023. The other five short-listed companies are Rolls Royce SMR, EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International, NuScale Power and Westinghouse Electric Company UK. If successful in the Great British Nuclear SMR competition, Holtec plans to establish a factory in the UK to build the major mechanical SMR components and support other aligned manufacturing needs in clean energy and defence sectors.",
            "Holtec says an exercise to find the best location for a factory will be launched in the coming weeks. If established, the factory will support deployment of 5 GW of on-grid UK electricity from SMR-300 by 2050 and create a major export hub. Holtec Britain’s Senior Advisor, Professor Dame Julia King, Baroness Brown of Cambridge stated, “Holtec is committed to delivering SMRs in the UK creating high-value well-paid jobs and providing clean energy to help us reach net zero. This agreement is another important step on this journey.”",
            "“Based on our strong partnership with Holtec, we have prepared for the GBN SMR competition with top-tier UK construction company Balfour Beatty and world class engineering firm Mott MacDonald, giving us even more confidence in our ability to successfully win the contract and execute the project,” said Young-Joon Yoon, President & CEO and of Hyundai E&C.",
            "Balfour Beatty Group CEO Leo Quinn, said SMRs can offer a more flexible, scalable solution. He added that the partnership “is perfectly positioned to address the growing demand for clean energy in the UK and support the UK’s transition towards a Net Zero future”.",
            "Cathy Travers, Group Managing Director of Mott MacDonald said: “International collaboration from across the nuclear industry is key to its successful deployment, which is why we are bringing decades of collective experience to bear as we explore this path with Holtec Britain and Hyundai E&C.”",
            "Gareth Thomas, Director of Holtec Britain told Reuters: \"Holtec will be investing approximately £600m in the construction, design and build of a new factory and production site over the next 15 years.\" Local authorities and businesses will be invited to submit expressions of interest to host the factory, outlining which sites could be available and how ready they would be for work to start on the factory. The factory could provide around 400 highly-skilled jobs in the next three-to-five years, Thomas said. Holtec already has an SMR factory in New Jersey in the USA, but believes a UK site could provide a base to export its technology to Europe and the Middle East.",

        "text": [
            "As part of his recent UK budget statement, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said: “I can announce that this week the government has reached agreement on a £160m ($203m) deal with Hitachi to purchase the Wylfa site in Ynys Môn and the Oldbury site in South Gloucestershire.” This was confirmed in paragraph 5.120 of the Budget Statement. Hunt said the purchase had been made \"given the importance of securing nuclear sites for the success of the nuclear programme\".",
            "In January 2021, Hitachi subsidiary Horizon Nuclear Power notified the UK Planning Inspectorate that it was withdrawing its application for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for Wylfa Newydd on Anglesey where it had planned to construct a nuclear power plant with two UK Advanced Boiling Water Reactors. The £20bn project had been expected to provide employment and business opportunities for the region.",
            "Hitachi had announced the suspension of the project in January 2019 and its intent to withdraw entirely in September 2020. In light of this, and in the absence of a new funding policy from HM Government, Hitachi decided to wind-up Horizon as an active development entity by 31 March 2021. Hitachi continued to manage the site under the control of its subsidiary Hitachi Europe Limited. \"This will be done with a view to considering development proposals from commercial or public sector developers who may come forward, and Horizon will continue to support this intent until the end of March,” said Horizon CEO Duncan Hawthorne. “Beyond this period Hitachi Europe will remain available to respond to any parties who may have an interest in acquiring these sites.\"",
            "In his budget speech, Hunt added that, as well as seeking a site for a new large-scale NPP, \"the government is now moving to the next stage of the SMR process, with six companies invited to submit their initial tender responses by June this year\". He added that \"no decisions have been taken on projects\". The government earlier outlined plans to increase nuclear energy capacity to 24 GWe by 2050, with a fleet of small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of that strategy. In 2023, the government and the new Great British Nuclear (GNB) arms-length body set up to help deliver extra nuclear capacity began the selection process for a suitable SMR technology. In October, EDF, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Holtec, NuScale Power, Rolls Royce SMR and Westinghouse were invited to bid for UK government contracts in the next stage of that process.",

            "US-based Kairos Power has signed a technology investment agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) to put into effect the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ADRP) risk reduction award, which the company received in 2020. Under the agreement, DOE will provide up to $303m on a performance-based, fixed-price milestone basis to enable the design, construction, and commissioning of the company’s Hermes demonstration reactor. A construction permit for the reactor was issued by the. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in December 2023.",
            "The Hermes design is for a 35 MWt non-power version of the company's fluoride salt-cooled high temperature reactor, the KP-HFR. Kairos has also submitted a construction permit application for Hermes 2, a proposed two-unit demonstration plant that would build on the experience of Hermes and would produce electricity and demonstrate the complete architecture of future commercial plants. The Hermes demonstration reactors will help mitigate technology, licensing, supply chain, and construction risk to achieve cost certainty for KP-HFR technology. Kairos is targeting commercial deployments in the early 2030s. Hermes is to be built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.",
            "Kairos Power is conducting salt operations at its first engineering test unit (ETU) in New Mexico. The ETU is a non-nuclear, full-scale mock-up of Hermes that will demonstrate key systems and components of the reactor, test the supply chain, and allow workers to gain operational experience. Kairos will build and operate a total of three ETU iterations before constructing Hermes.",
            "Mike Laufer, Kairos Power co-founder and CEO, noted: “With the use of fixed-price milestone payments, this innovative contract provides real benefits to both Kairos Power and DOE to ensure the successful completion of the Hermes reactor. It allows us to remain focused on achieving the most important goals of the project while retaining agility and flexibility to move quickly as we learn key lessons through our iterative development approach.”",
            "DOE Office of Nuclear Energy Assistant Secretary Dr Kathryn Huff said the Hermes reactor “is an important step toward realising advanced nuclear energy’s role in ushering forward the nation’s clean energy transition”. She added: “Partnerships like this one play a significant role in making advanced nuclear technology commercially competitive.”",
            "The KP-HFR is one of five teams selected in 2020 by the DOE to receive $30m in initial funding for risk reduction projects under the ARDP. The other projects were Westinghouse Electric Company’s eVinci Microreactor, the BWXT Advanced Nuclear Reactor (BANR), Holtec’s SMR-160 Reactor, and Southern Company’s Molten Chloride Reactor Experiment. DOE had earlier in 2020 selected TerraPower and X-energy to receive $160m in initial funding for ARDP Demonstration projects to develop two advanced nuclear reactors to be operational within seven years.",

            "Sheffield Forgemasters has completed weld-assembly of a full-size small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear vessel demonstrator using Local Electron-Beam Welding (LEBW). Sheffield Forgemasters Research, Design & Technology Director Jesus Talamantes-Silva said the company had achieved “a significant milestone in assembling a nuclear vessel demonstrator, using electron beam welding for the first time at this scale, with 100% success and no defects”.",
            "Completing four, thick, nuclear-grade welds took less than 24 hours – work which typically requires a year. \"With a diameter of three metres and a wall thickness of 200mm, construction of the vessel showcases the reliability and capabilities of LEBW, setting a dramatic new standard for weld-joining thick-walled components, previously untrialled in a demonstrator model,\" the company noted.",
            "The operation deployed specially developed parameters, meticulously fine-tuned during the welding development stage, including innovative sloping-in and sloping-out techniques to start and finish the weld, ensuring a clean and complete weld-join.",
            "Senior development engineer and project lead Michael Blackmore believes the implication of this technology within the nuclear industry is monumental, potentially taking high-cost welding processes out of the equation. \"Not only does this reduce the need for weld-inspections, because the weld-join replicates the parent material, but it could also dramatically speed up the roll-out of SMR reactors across the UK and beyond, that's how disruptive the LEBW breakthrough is.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters said demonstrating LEBW technology's potential opens new horizons for \"more efficient, low-cost and less time-heavy nuclear assemblies\" with far-reaching implications for other projects which require thick-walled welded assemblies.",
            "Jacob Pope, development engineer and LEBW machine tool installation lead said: “We thank the government's Department for Energy Security & Net Zero for enabling the project through its Nuclear Innovation Programme. We also thank our esteemed partner, Cambridge Vacuum Engineering, for their invaluable support throughout this endeavour. Their remote and on-site assistance played an instrumental role in the success of this milestone, highlighting the collaborative spirit that drives us forward.\"",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters, which was acquired by the UK's Ministry of Defence in 2021, is the only UK company able to manufacture the large forgings required for SMRs. The company said future activities include a joint industrial project “supported by key participants from the USA and UK”. The aim is “to initiate a code case or multiple cases to facilitate the deployment of this technology in accordance with the standards set by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)”.",
            "In December, the company said it was on track to regain ASME status as a supplier of heavy forgings and castings to the civil nuclear market. An ASME Section III Division I NCA 3300, NCA 4000 and NQA-1 Code survey and audit, has recommended it for Material Organisation (MO), and welding (NPT) accreditations. This would allow it supply castings and forgings (material) for civil nuclear applications and also be qualified to carry out weld construction activities on these materials.",
            "Sheffield Forgemasters has signed a number of agreements with SMR design companies. In October 2023 it signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with US X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear (a UK subsidiary of Babcock International) to explore opportunities around the deployment of a fleet of Xe-100 high temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs) in the UK. Under the MOU, X-energy and Cavendish Nuclear will make use of Sheffield Forgemasters' extensive experience in developing nuclear forgings and castings. The companies plan to build up to 40 Xe-100s across the UK.",
            "Earlier, in February 2023, the company signed an MOU with with Holtec Britain to design components for Holtec’s SMR-160 SMR and identify the best routes to manufacture. This followed similar agreements with other SMR developers. In July 2016, SFI and NuScale Power agreed to co-operate to develop the manufacturing techniques needed for the planned deployment of NuScale's SMR in the UK. Another MOU was signed in December 2021 with Rolls-Royce SMR to jointly explore commercial mechanisms for long-term collaboration on the supply of forgings to Rolls-Royce’s planned UK SMR fleet. In September 2022 SFI signed an MOU with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 SMR in the UK.",

The AP300 SMR was recently selected for the next phase of Great British Nuclear and selected by Community Nuclear Power (CNP), which seeks to build four units in Northeast England. Westinghouse says these projects will also leverage its 75-year history of nuclear fuel manufacturing operations in the UK at its facility in Springfields, Lancashire.",
            "“The UK regulators are already very familiar with the AP300 SMR’s underpinning technology,” said David Durham, Westinghouse Energy Systems President. Westinghouse’s AP300 SMR will utilise the AP1000 engineering, components and supply chain, enabling streamlined licensing and leveraging available technical skills. “Together, these factors provide confidence that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s, Westinghouse said.",
            "The GDA process is carried out by two UK regulators – the Office for Nuclear Regulation and the Environment Agency – to assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of a nuclear power plant designs.

CNP, established in September 2022, is working with strategic partners, including Jacobs and Interpath Advisory, to develop a fully licensed site for the project, with a target of 2027. The project is being privately funded. CNP said the component parts and agreements needed for the project are in place, including land, capability, technology, private capital funding, and community demand.",
            "“This is the first privately funded project deploying SMRs anywhere in Europe, and our goal is to be generating clean energy with in ten years’ time,” CNP noted. “There is mature market-led demand in Teesside for clean, reliable energy – in this instance a programme to build a specialised site that provides green sustainable power for the region and supports the development of a Green Energy and Chemical Hub on the North Tees Group Estate, with the ambition of producing power to liquids (e-fuels and e-chemicals) through an offtake ecosystem on the north bank of the River Tees, near Stockton-on-Tees.”",
            "CNP added that the North Tees Group Estate is reclaimed and regenerated industrial land, “and the provision of clean, always-on energy from at least four AP300s will help attract inward investment and high-value jobs”. The development will work in partnership with local business and the regional authorities.",

It is also “complementary to and supportive of Westinghouse’s participation in Great British Nuclear’s (GBN) SMR technology selection process”. It will expand “workforce, training and supply chain localisation via multiple deployment projects”.",

It will utilise identical AP1000 technology, to include major equipment, structural components, passive safety, proven fuel, and I&C systems. Westinghouse says the AP300 “will bring to bear a mature supply chain, constructability lessons learned, fast load-follow capabilities and proven O&M procedures and best practices from 18 reactor years of safe AP1000 operations.” Like the AP1000, the AP300 is designed to operate for an 80+ year life cycle.",

            "Advanced nuclear technologies could form an integral part of the solution to reconcile the need for clean energy with energy security; this is the conclusion of a new report from Charles River Associates (CRA). The report breaks down the role of advanced nuclear technology to meet decarbonisation goals and notes that various regions and governments are including the technology in core policy objectives. The report also offers an overview of the trends and challenges that face the nuclear supply chain, spanning from extraction and processing to end-use applications and waste management.",
            "CRA’s report, titled: ‘Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies: A Tailwind for Nuclear Energy Revival’ further says: “The renewed prominence of nuclear in the energy transition reflects the growing emphasis on energy security and decarbonization among policy makers. Alongside the repowering of existing nuclear plants, advanced nuclear technologies are now also under the spotlight as they hold the promise of shorter construction timelines, lower overhead costs, and cross-industry applications.”",
            "Addressing investment challenges",
            "The report highlights that given some of the biggest challenges to infrastructure investing are inflation and regulation, including permitting and licensing, taxation, and safety standards, investors require certainty.",
            "Meera Kotak, Associate Principal at CRA and co-author of the report, points to the recent collapse of Nuscale’s Idaho National Laboratory scheme as an example of the challenges advanced reactors face when considering deployment: “The Nuscale news really does show how difficult it can be for developers to line up all the different components in the macro context of high inflation and high interest rates. If you are a developer that started back when the rates weren’t what they are today, you are going to be hit by them even if you’re grounded in the best technological positions.”",
            "Kotak points to some relatively simple solutions though: “In the first instance, the industry needs government support to drive projects forward in the first of a kind development. The industry would also benefit from a coherent regulatory framework that crosses borders.”",
            "that alongside sustained policy support, a better regulatory framework is needed for advanced reactors to deliver on their potential: “The technology can be mature, the customers can be ready and we are seeing a lot of market demand there, but having those government policy and regulatory markers to incentivise investment is still needed. The central mechanisms aren’t yet in the place that they need to be to enable the advent and progression of advanced reactors.”",
            "Nonetheless, she does pick up on some positive signs of change: “There is an element of sharing on the fundamentals across borders. There have been some examples with the US and Canada in terms of exchanging learnings on the regulatory processes that they’re undertaking.”",
            "However, Kotak notes that much of the regulatory structure was developed around large conventional reactors that has a knock-on impact on, for example, how insurance products for small reactors are set up and delivered. This in turn has an impact on how the private sector perceives advanced reactors as an attractive investment prospect. “The regulatory system needs to evolve as the products evolve; investors seem interested in the promise of advanced and small reactors relative to conventional, but it’s very much hinged on policy sentiment.” Kotak highlights the Inflation Reduction Act rolled out earlier this year in the US as an example of positive sentiment that could serve as a model for wider advanced reactor deployment: “The tax credits that we saw in the US with the IRA, has been very promising given the wave of new developments and progress that occurred as a result. Given the nascency of these new technologies, the role of government and the introduction of supportive policy has shown to be important in navigating the uncertainty that comes with innovation.",
            "Kotak also identifies a number of other challenges that must be addressed if advanced reactors are to be deployed at scale. “Whilst there are nuances across the different technologies, considerations do need to be made with regards to the supply chain, and labour and skills capacity. Public sentiment towards nuclear is also part of the challenge and needs to be overcome, given the benefits, and passive safety features, that small and advanced reactors bring relative to conventional designs.”",
            "Indeed, the report argues that under certain circumstances, the economic viability of advanced nuclear technologies is notable, offering some advantages relative to other energy sources, including renewable and storage portfolios. This distinction is particularly noticeable at high levels of renewable penetration when contributions to capacity from renewables starts to decline.",
            "Kotak adds: “It’s exciting that there are so many different options on the table and each have distinct points that they’re working through, but equally opportunities to offset. Whilst there might be a supply chain obstacle for one design, it might also enable it to advance because of other factors that are impeding a different design get solved first.”",
            "Advanced nuclear can also offer a more appealing proposition for off-takers or utility buyers, as demonstrated by the evaluation of the value-adjusted levelised cost of electricity (VALCOE), which considers the relative contribution of the technology to the electricity system in terms of energy, capacity and flexibility services.",
            "The report notes that the case for additional advanced nuclear capacity is reinforced by the fact that long-term operation of nuclear power plants has the lowest levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) among all other technologies, including newly built solar and offshore wind. However, larger reactors often have extended construction timelines and conventional nuclear reactors (Generation I, II and III) typically feature high levels of fuel expenditure, with most of the construction activities occurring at the reactor site. As Kotak says: “Advanced reactors such as the molten salts, the micro reactors, they’re all being predicated on the fact that they’re trying to offset the challenges that the large reactors bring for example trying to offset those cost overruns that appear to be inherent with traditional designs. Each has a USP and each of them is trying to target or offset a problem that has been in the industry and that’s a positive.",
            "A recently published report on behalf of EPRI and conducted by CRA titled, shows how across 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, a first of a kind (FOAK) small modular reactor (SMR) has an overall average capital cost that is 16% less than a conventional light water reactor (LWR), primarily driven by lower financing costs resulting from shorter construction durations. This could ultimately result in lower total project costs for smaller reactors compared to their larger counterparts when considering both overnight and financing expenses.",
            "Additionally, when integrated with thermal storage, advanced nuclear technologies can provide enhanced flexibility in the delivery of ancillary services, further underscoring their intrinsic advantages compared to conventional alternatives.",
            "The report says that merits of advanced nuclear technologies present a strong case for potential investment opportunities. While external influences, such as government and industry, play a major role in de-risking investment, the role of the investor itself is critical in bridging the investment gap needed to enable the transition towards second-of-a-kind reactors and achieve commercial returns.",
            "“There is an argument to say that it is not which design will win, but which one will be able to be deployed first. There’s a variety of market policy and regulatory factors, skills factors, supply chain and fuel factors that must be addressed, but at the end of the day, you need that customer demand and you need the funding to be able to get it not just to first of a kind, but to commercial return, which requires Nth of a kind deployment. This is where the returns that make it economic can be seen. The industry needs enough funding for it to get to not just one, but perhaps four, seven, reactors that enable Nth of a kind projections. At this point, the economic benefits align and compound the otherwise existing inherent benefits of small reactors, such as the ability to power remote locations and offset grid infrastructure problems, and the modular construction and factory build approach that is poised to offset costs,” she says.",
            "The report highlights a number of examples of policies encouraging private sector engagement, noting for example, that Canada and the US have consistently supported nuclear as part of their energy mix. Both countries have extensive governmental backing for the advancement of nuclear technologies.",
            "Canada’s introduction of a clean technology investment tax credit of 30% explicitly focuses on SMR technology. Canada also recognises nuclear energy as a ‘fundamental and necessary component’ of the low-carbon energy system.",
            "In addition, the development of SMRs is supported at both the national and provincial levels. The federal government released its SMR Roadmap in 2018 and SMR Action plan in 2020, supporting the development, demonstration and deployment of SMRs for various uses domestically and internationally. Canada’s federal budget for 2023, announced in March, provided a 15% refundable investment tax credit for clean electricity, including nuclear. This credit is separate from the clean technology investment tax credit introduced in the 2022 federal budget, which provided a tax credit of up to 30% for non-emitting electricity generation technologies, including SMRs. On March 28, 2022, the provinces of Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta released a plan outlining a path forward for SMRs as a deliverable under the provincial SMR memorandum of understanding (MoU). Ontario Power Generation (OPG), Bruce Power, New Brunswick Power and SaskPower have been working collectively to develop three streams of SMR project proposals. On September 21, 2023, the province of Alberta announced the allocation of US$5m in funding (C$7m) towards a multi-year research initiative aimed at assessing the techno-economic feasibility, as well as considerations for safety behind implementing SMRs within oil sands operations.",
            "As Kotak says: “Such policy measures would give confidence to investors that this is a technology that we are going to support and it is not going to be dropped and lose your investment. Similar to what was done with wind and solar. It’s only at the price it is today because of that level of support to drive innovation and driving new supply chains. Private investment has come in now because of the amount of subsidies that went into it from the outset.”",
            "The report also emphasises the growing role of the private sector, noting that in July 2023, OPG announced its collaboration with the provincial government to plan and license three additional SMRs, for a total of four SMRs at OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project.",
            "Earlier in January, OPG, GEH, SNC-Lavalin and Aecon signed the first commercial contract for a grid-scale SMR in North America. The six-year partnership seeks to finalise the construction of a BWRX-300 SMR at the Darlington site by the end of 2028, with plans to commence power supply to the grid in 2029. This comes in the wake of the Canadian Infrastructure Bank commitment of US$713m (C$970), announced in October 2022, to finance the first phase of OPG’s Darlington New Nuclear Project. In 2021, OPG selected GEH’s BWRX-300 SMR for the project.",
            "Kotak picks up on these developments: “It’s great to see different vendor-utility or customer partnerships that are driving for clusters or multiples of reactor units that still reach the required output.”",
            "The report notes that Europe is also seeing both public and private sector engagement, highlighting that the market is divided in its views on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix. Some countries, including Germany, Italy and Lithuania, have phased out nuclear power; Austria, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Portugal signed a joint declaration, opposing the inclusion of nuclear in the EU Green finance taxonomy. In contrast, France, the European leader in nuclear power, has brought together a ‘Nuclear Alliance’ consisting of 11 countries. This alliance will work towards strengthening cooperation in nuclear energy as an important component of Europe’s energy goals.",
            "In a bid to cement its leadership in civilian nuclear energy, France, in 2022, announced its plans to build six new next-generation nuclear reactors by 2050, with a possibility of deploying an additional eight. This plan was catalysed by Parliament’s recent approval of the Government’s nuclear investment plan, allocating €52bn to the construction of new reactors. While the project work is yet to begin, EDF Energy plans to commission its first two facilities in 2035 and a third in 2040. France’s ambition to deploy its first SMR by 2030 contributes to the government vision for nuclear to account for more than 50% of the country’s electricity mix.",
            "The report further notes that in Poland, energy-intensive companies such as Synthos and PKN Orlen, established a joint venture to deploy an SMR fleet, GEH’s BWRX-300. In addition, ENEA Group, one of the largest power companies in Poland, is collaborating with Last Energy to develop SMRs.",
            "Other countries, including UK, Romania and the Czech Republic that have historically been dependent on coal to meet their energy needs, are increasingly turning to advanced nuclear technologies as a means of decarbonising their energy systems.",
            "“We’re seeing the private sector engage in Eastern Europe, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, with high-wealth individuals exploring options with small and advanced reactors. Bill Gates’ TerraPower has shown what private investment can do to propel a new reactor design,” says Kotak.",
            "Kotak also points to a broader economic benefit to those nations that do successfully deploy advanced reactor technology: “Once that first of a kind small reactor is identified and can be commercially developed, there could be significant export potential for a market.” She adds: “The timeliness, limitations and opportunities of all clean energy resources – nuclear, CCUS, hydrogen, geothermal – need to be considered.”",
            "The report says that the nuclear energy sector challenge is exacerbated by the imminent retirement of the current nuclear workforce. A multi-year, multi-unit build-up of nuclear reactors will require addressing the labour shortage at various stages, including education, recruitment for entry-level positions and the identification of highly skilled master tradespeople.",
            "“From a vendor developer perspective, business models are set up with the intention to build more than one reactor, given the level of infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing capabilities and people required. The repeatability is the USP. If the modular construction, factory build, and ability to just repeat orders isn’t taken up on, it could miss a key opportunity. The report notes that designs are planned for modules to be built at factories and then transported to the main reactor site, reducing the total construction time required. Microreactors take this concept a step further and are designed such that the entire reactor can be transported at once,” says Kotak.",
            "Nonetheless, Kotak is optimistic, she says: “Advanced nuclear technology could play a pivotal role in the decarbonisation of our energy systems. I am positive because fundamentally, regardless of what design gets chosen, it has a role to play as a clean energy source, and to enable the pathway to net zero. I think, ultimately, we need to be reminded that all COP nations or signatories have all signed up to this to reduce emissions and to reach those net zero goals.” As Kotak concludes: “As the costs become more secure, the investment returns become more clear and that regulatory and policy structures are in place to give that confirmation of returns, I think we will see more private investment, as we’ve seen with other energy sources.”"

        "title": "Holtec unveils combined nuclear-solar power plant design",
        "text": [
            "US-based Holtec International has announced a combined nuclear-solar power plant design – CNSP (Combined Nuclear/Solar Plant). It combines Holtec’s SMR-300 small modular reactor (SMR) design with its HI-THERM HSP, solar thermal system as well as its Green Boiler to provide base load or on-demand power to counter the intermittency of solar plants. The Green Boiler is a three-in-one device that can store vast amounts of heat, receives high temperature heat from the solar collector, and make motive steam at the required pressure and superheat to power the turbine. Holtec President & CEO Dr Kris Singh noted: “We believe that an adroit combination of nuclear and solar embodied in the CNSP provides a compelling solution for nations seeking to move past fossil fuels.”",
            "Holtec says the most immediate application of the CNSP technology is to facilitate the transition from “coal to clean”. Coal-fired plants typically have sufficient land area to house the CNSP, which would use the coal plant’s power block minimising the cost of transition. The steam production part of the coal plant will be decommissioned, freeing up most of the plant’s land area for the solar plant. Holtec plans to offer the CNSP technology principally in those regions of the world where solar radiation level is adequate to be harvestable.",
            "“Our SMR-300 small modular reactor is premised on the most proven type of light water technology used in most land-based reactors and in submarines and aircraft carriers,” Holtec notes. SMR-300 has added defence-in-depth features that are gravity-actuated and “confer fail-safe emergency recovery capability to the nuclear plant qualifying it for the moniker ‘walk away safe’”.",
            "Solar’s contribution to the CNSP will be through the HI-THERM HSP hybrid solar plant, “which is considerably more efficient than its predecessor technologies, yielding as much as 8 MWH of solar heat per acre in equatorial and subtropical locales”. The nuclear reactor’s steam supply system and heat from the solar thermal plant “are conjugated in the Green Boiler which is a multi-function device engineered to produce steam at the desired pressure and superheat to run the coal plant’s existing turbogenerator”.",
            "At sites with no pre-existing fossil plant, the solar thermal plant can be as large as the available land area will accommodate. Holtec says experts in power plant cycle design would appreciate that the CNSP will have a much higher thermodynamic efficiency than the nuclear plant alone and would make solar power an integral part of base load supply. “The CNSP does not use any batteries, which have been the Achilles heel of the renewable energy industry. In fact, CNSP contains no fragile parts or materials that may limit its service life, which is expected to exceed 60 years.”",

        "title": "Operations begin at Ukraine’s used fuel dry storage facility",
        "text": [
            "Ukrainian nuclear utility Energoatom says it has begun transporting used nuclear fuel from its operating reactors to the newly built and commissioned Holtec-engineered Central Spent Fuel Storage Facility (CSFSF) known as a Consolidated Interim Storage (CIS) Facility in the US. The CSFSF is expected to save approximately $200m a year compared with the previous practice of transporting used fuel to Russia for reprocessing. “Today, Ukraine is entirely self-sufficient in the strategically crucial area of storage and management of the used nuclear fuel discharged by its reactors eliminating a critical constraint in the continued generation of electricity by the nation’s nine reactors,” Energoatom noted.",
            "The joint cooperative efforts of Energoatom and Holtec International have deployed state-of-the-art storage and transport systems for Russian-origin (VVER) nuclear fuel which have proven defence-in-depth features against accidents and mishaps, Energoatom said. Equipment includes the HI-STORM 190 vertical ventilated storage system, the HI-STAR 190 Universal Transport Cask, the HI-TRAC 190 Transfer Cask, and an array of ancillary equipment to load, dehydrate, and weld the double wall Multiple Purpose Canisters at each operating plant site.",
            "The dried and welded Double Wall Canisters have been safely transported in the HI-STAR 190 transport cask to the Central Storage Facility and placed in the HI-STORM 190 vertical ventilated systems for environmentally safe-storage. The high-capacity Double Wall Multi-Purpose Canisters and the heavily shielded transport cask HI-STAR 190 “have become Ukraine’s workhorse to transport the country’s used fuel from its nine reactors to the nation’s consolidated interim storage facility”. Although the Design Life of CSFSF is 100 years, their Service Life is expected to be many times longer.",
            "While the major equipment was manufactured at Holtec’s US plants, the company’s European contractors in Estonia, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands also supplied important components and systems to the project.",
            "Energoatom President Petro Kotin said: “Safe, secure, and reliable operations of the Central Spent Fuel Storage Facility are critically important for Ukraine’s nuclear energy industry to ensure continued supply of electricity to our citizens …. The successful operation of this vital facility is not only saving Ukraine annually $200m which Energoatom would have had to spend on paying for the transportation and storage of spent fuel to Russia, but it has achieved one of the most important objectives in advancing our nation’s energy independence.” He added that the facility was operating at 100% capacity and that the cost savings for the export and storage of spent fuel from domestic plants this year alone had already fully covered the costs for the facility’s construction.",
            "Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko noted: “We have put an end to Russia’s monopoly on the used nuclear fuel market. We have a unique Centralised Spent Fuel Storage Facility, and we plan to build a manufacturing plant for the production of containers for storage of used nuclear fuel in our country. With such professional partners as Holtec International, the revival of Ukrainian nuclear industry is not just a goal but a reality for us.”",
            "“Approximately two decades ago, Ukraine began its long quest to establish a supremely safe consolidated interim storage facility to take full control of its used nuclear fuel. That journey has finally come to fruition,” said Holtec President & CEO Dr Kris Singh. “This facility now has made Ukraine an international leader in consolidated storage of spent nuclear fuel. Holtec International also has the distinct honor and privilege to work with Energoatom for deployment of our SMR-300 Advanced Nuclear Reactors in Ukraine in this decade.”",
            "Energoatom and Holtec have agreed in principle to establish a state of-the-art manufacturing facility for localising the production of equipment for Holtec small modular reactors (SMRs), used fuel storage and transport systems, and other nuclear energy related needs. To advance this objective, it is envisioned to establish a joint venture between Energoatom and Holtec for a Ukrainian manufacturing facility and technology centre that will serve as the vehicle to introduce the latest manufacturing technology into Ukraine. This facility would host an engineering/design centre, space for material storage, component manufacturing, assembly, and testing, as well as training facilities, including a SMR simulator. The facility is expected to create thousands of skilled jobs.",
            "Kotin said this “would be of great importance for the post-war economic recovery of our country”. He added: “We must use advanced and unconditionally safe nuclear technologies as our nuclear energy sector generates more than 55% of the country’s electricity. This joint collaboration with Holtec provides a great opportunity for Ukraine to become a leader in the field of Global Nuclear Energy.”",
            "Dr Singh noted: “We think the new nuclear manufacturing plant and its supply chain will help to further integrate Ukraine’s economy with the EU, United Kingdom, and the United States strengthening the country’s economic ties with the EU and justifying fast tracking Ukraine to become a valued member of the Union. In our experience, Ukraine’s nuclear sector already meets the metrics of business transparency and corporate ethics required under EU’s rules for accession.”",

            "Six small modular reactor (SMR) designs have been selected to progress to the next stage of a UK competition that forms a key part of government ambitions for up to a quarter of the country’s electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The designs chosen by Great British Nuclear – the government-backed body driving nuclear projects across the UK – are those considered most able to deliver operating reactors by the mid-2030s and support the UK’s ambitions to reach 24 GW of nuclear capacity by 2050. Gwen Parry-Jones, CEO of Great British Nuclear, explained: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029.”",
            "The SMR competition is part of a plan for the UK to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper and more secure energy. A nuclear power revival is a central plank of that strategy and the companies through to the next stage will be invited to bid for government contracts later this year. The winning bidders are expected to be announced in spring next year and contracts are due to be awarded in the summer. Announcing the initial tranche of winning entrants, UK Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said: “Small Modular Reactors will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy.”",
            "EDF, GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy International LLC, Holtec Britain Limited, NuScale Power, Rolls-Royce SMR and Westinghouse Electric Company UK Limited are the companies that have been chosen for the next stage of the process. Key design details and developments are outlined below:",
            "EDF’s NUWARDTM is a Generation III+ pressurised water reactor with an integrated primary loop producing 340 MWe from two independent reactors rated at 170 MWe each or 540 MWth. The two units will be housed in a single building and will share common equipment where possible.",
            "According to EDF, the design is focused on standardisation, modular manufacturing and simplicity for in-factory mass production, and flexibility in the construction and operation phases. Furthermore, the design has been developed to support load following and adapted for non-electric uses. With a design availability of around 90%, the fuel cycle is two years and the service life is 60 years. The core features 76 fuel assemblies.",
            "In March this year, EDF created the NUWARD subsidiary in line with its objective to achieve first nuclear concrete in 2030 for its reference SMR plant in France. After finalising the conceptual design, NUWARD is now shifting to the basic design phase.",
            "The NUWARD subsidiary will continue to work with historic partners CEA, TechnicAtome, Naval Group as well as new partners Framatome and Tractebel who were onboarded last year. Tractebel will be responsible for the civil engineering preliminary studies and the evaluation of costs, for example.",
            "Earlier this year EDF submitted the NUWARD design to France’s Autorité de Sûreté Nucléaire (ASN – Nuclear Safety Authority), marking the start of the pre-licensing process while in June 2022, EDF announced that the design would be the case study for a European early joint regulatory review led by ASN with participation from Finland’s Radiation & Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) and the Czech State Office for Nuclear Safety (SÚJB).",
            "Renaud Crassous, NUWARD’s President said: “We are committed to increasing the speed of execution to deliver the NUWARDTM SMR design on time to meet market expectations for first nuclear concrete as early as 2030”.",
            "According to EDF’s SMR roadmap, the detailed design and formal application for a new nuclear facility is scheduled to be carried out between 2025 and 2030, during which time the design is expected to be certified and the supply chain developed.",
            "The aim is to achieve first nuclear concrete for its reference plant in France in 2030, after finalising the conceptual design phase of the project. Construction is expected to take three years.",
            "GE Hitachi’s BWRX-300 is a 300 MWe SMR generating 870 MWth that is based on a larger BWR that is already licensed and operating. The Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (ESBWR) is a Generation III+ reactor certified by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2014. The SMR version, the BWRX-300, uses natural circulation and passive cooling isolation condenser systems as well as fully passive safety systems. It’s fuel enrichment, averaging 3.81% and with a 4.95% maximum, puts it firmly in the realms of conventional commercially available fuels and it has a design refueling cycle of 12-24 months as well as a 60-year operational design life.",
            "The construction technologies incorporated into the design adopt advanced concrete solutions and innovative techniques that have been proven in the oil and gas, tunneling and power industries. As a result of this approach and using a combination of modular and open-top construction techniques, GE Hitachi suggests the Nth-of-a-kind BWRX-300 can be constructed in as little as 24-36 months while also achieving an approximate 90% volume reduction in plant layout. In addition, reducing the building volume by about 50% per MW it should also account for around half the amount of concrete. As with other SMR designs, the BWRX-300 claims a cost-competitive approach that can be deployed for both electricity generation and industrial applications, including hydrogen production, desalination, and district heating.",
            "An advanced reactor, GE Hitachi says the BWRX-300 sets itself apart from other SMR designs with its proven, less complicated attributes and anticipates the design will be deployable globally as early as 2029 thanks to proven know-how and innovative construction techniques. Launched in 2017, the SMR is the 10th evolution of the BWR light water reactor design from GE.",
            "The design has achieved some notable success. This year the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) announced plans to explore the construction of multiple advanced nuclear reactors including proposals for a BWRX-300 at its Clinch River site, starting with a plant design and an NRC license application with a view to potentially getting an operational SMR at the site around 2032. Meanwhile, last year Canada’s Ontario Power Generation (OPG) selected the BWRX-300 for single-unit project that was initially anticipated to begin operating as early as 2028.",
            "Holtec’s SMR-160+ small modular reactor is a PWR that uses low-enriched uranium fuel. The design, which has been in development since 2010, features a reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components that are located underground, as well as a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down or dissipate decay heat. A key part of the SMR-160 roll-out as envisioned by Holtec is to deploy the reactor as a replacement for the boilers found in coal-fired power stations and reusing the majority of the existing assets. The use of multi-stage compressors that are capable of uprating SMR-160’s steam (700 psi @ 595 Deg F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant are a critical part of this plan. Furthermore, the ability of the SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure also opens new development opportunities, such as using high-pressure steam for industrial applications.",
            "Having been shortlisted, the aim is to start construction of the first UK SMR-160 unit as early as 2028 and Holtec intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s in serial production by 2050 across the UK, amounting to 5.1 GW.",
            "This year South Korean national financial institutions K-Sure (Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) and Kexim (Export-Import Bank of Korea) signed agreements with Holtec and Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to provide financial support for SMR-160 projects around the world.",
            "Holtec has a collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C from late 2021 that will see Hyundai perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction. The reactor will be initially manufactured at Holtec’s Krishna P. Singh Technology Campus in Camden, New Jersey.",
            "The SMR-160 design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission’s three-phase pre-licensing design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "More recently, Ukraine’s nuclear generating company Energoatom signed a cooperation agreement that envisions implementation of an SMR-160 pilot project with targeted grid connection by March 2029. The deal further contemplates up to 20 additional SMR-160 units in Ukraine and a manufacturing facility.",
            "The NuScale SMR is a PWR dubbed the NuScale Power Module. This a small PWR is designed to generate 77 MWe at 250 MWth and with be deloyed as a series of modules that can be scaled to meet specific demand up to 924 MWe. VOYGRTM SMR plants will feature four six or up to 12 power modules. It will use standard light water reactor fuel and is the only small modular reactor to receive design approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). As with other SMR designs, the NuScale Power Module was developed to supply electricity but also potentially generation, district heating, desalination, commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications. The design features passive operating and safety systems and the modules are submerged in a pool built below ground level.",
            "NuScale SMR projects are already being considered in more than 10 countries and the first project is expected to begin operation in 2029 in Idaho. NuScale has already placed an order for the production of pressure vessel components and, in May, South Korea’s Doosan Enerbility began producing forgings for the first VOYGR-6 power plant to be built for Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS).",
            "Earlier this year Polish metals company KGHM Polska MiedzKGHM received preliminary state approval for a planned SMR which followed on from a 2022 agreement with NuScale to work on deploying a VOYGR plant in Poland by 2029.",
            "A Memorandum of Understanding was also signed this year by Romanian nuclear utility SNN, NuScale, Romanian companies E-INFRA and Nova Power & Gas, US-based Fluor Enterprises and South Korea’s Samsung C&T Corporation to collaborate on the deployment of VOYGR plants in Central and Eastern Europe. Romania aims to be the first country in Europe to deploy a VOYGR SMR and earlier this month Romania’s National Commission for the Control of Nuclear Activities approved the Licensing Basis Document for the NuScale design.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design is one of the larger reactors destined for this market as a three loop PWR with an output of 470 MWe derived from 1,358 MWth. The Rolls-Royce SMR concept is centred on innovative modularisation of reliable and proven technology, allowing maximum use of the factory environment to combine standard components with advanced manufacturing techniques. The factory-built modularisation approach is expected to drastically reduce the amount of on-site construction while its compact footprint and modular design means it can be located alongside energy intensive industrial processes.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR, which was established in November 2021, suggests the unit will offer availability above 92% for 60 years supplying both on- and off-grid electricity as well supplying industrial applications and sectors such as the production of clean fuels. They add that their low-cost nuclear solution is expected to be competitive with renewable alternatives. The Rolls-Royce SMR design is currently progressing through Generic Design Assessment in the UK where it has completed the first phase and is expected to complete the second step by July 2024.",
            "Commenting on the shortlisting, Chris Cholerton, Rolls-Royce SMR CEO, said: “We have the only SMR technology in a European regulatory approval process, putting us almost two years ahead of any of our competitors. Securing a domestic contract is vitally important to unlock the enormous global export potential of our clean energy technology.”",
            "This year Rolls-Royce SMR and Sumitomo Corporation completed a joint feasibility study which shows the reactor could offer a significant advantage for the production of low-carbon hydrogen when cost, availability and carbon emissions are taken into consideration.",
            "The company has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Finnish power company Fortum to explore opportunities for the deployment of SMRs in Finland and Sweden. Last year Fortum began a two-year feasibility study to explore necessary conditions for deployment of SMRs.",
            "A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs and expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s. Rolls-Royce is also discussing deployment of its SMR with the Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia and the Netherlands.",
            "The Westinghouse AP300TM small modular reactor is currently the only SMR based on a licensed, operating nuclear reactor design. Launched in May this year, the design is derived from the operating AP1000 PWR which makes it unlike every other SMR under development with first-of-a-kind technologies and risks. It is an advanced, Generation III+ single-loop pressurised light water reactor.",
            "It utilises the same engineering, components and supply chain as the AP1000 which Westinghouse says will thus enable streamlined licensing and leveraging of available technical skills. The company adds that the advantageous economics of the AP300 are based on robust analysis and existing project costs from AP1000 reactors already in operation or development. Four AP1000 units are operating in China with a further six under construction and one is operating at Plant Vogtle in Georgia, USA, while a second is nearing completion there. The simplified, modular, ultra-compact nuclear island also reduces construction costs and schedule, Westinghouse says. For these reasons the company argues that it is confident that the first operating unit will be available in the early 2030s.",
            "The AP300 SMR features advanced passive safety systems designed to achieve and maintain safe shutdown condition without operator action, back-up power or pumps and has an output of 300 MWe from 990 MWth.",
            "Commenting, Patrick Fragman, Westinghouse President and CEO said: “We look forward to this opportunity to demonstrate that the AP300 SMR is the best option for the UK.”",
            "Earlier this year Westinghouse Electric Company and Finland’s Fortum signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to study the possibilities for the development and deployment of AP300 reactor projects in Finland and Sweden. This deal was followed by a similar MoU agreement with Slovak state-owned nuclear company JAVYS and another with Ukraine’s Energoatom.",
            "The successful development of SMRs could completely transform how nuclear power stations are built and result in billions of pounds of investment in the UK and elsewhere. The flexibility of design means that SMRs could also play a significant role is decarbonising hard-to-reach sectors like chemicals, building materials and other energy-intensive industries. Although six companies’ designs have been shortlisted for the next phase of the UK competition, much will depend on a successful roll out of the winning designs, not just in the UK but much further afield too. SMRs clearly offer much promise but the success of SMRs will also mark a key breakthrough for nuclear technology more broadly."

            "The UK Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), along with the Environment Agency (EA) and Natural Resources have started a Generic Design Assessment (GDA) for Holtec International’s SMR-300. The Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) made the request to the regulators following its readiness review of Holtec’s application. The review concluded that the design was ready to enter the GDA process.",
            "The UK's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including SMRs, in May 2021. ONR said the GDA assessment for the SMR-300 “will look to actively explore opportunities to maximise the value of international regulatory collaboration and identify efficiencies in processes”. DESNZ said the application “exceeded the quality thresholds across all four assessment criteria and successfully completed the department's due diligence and governance approvals processes”.",
            "The SMR-300 is a pressurised water reactor (PWR) using technology based on existing standards in the US and UK and uses PWR fuel similar to that already used at Sizewell B, and other new UK reactors under development including Hinkley Point C. Holtec has been developing its SMR since 2011. The SMR-300 has undergone several design evolutions, the most recent of which is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "Holtec Britain announced that it had received a grant from the UK Government of £30m ($37.6m) through the Future Nuclear Enabling Fund to complete Steps 1&2 of the GDA to support possible deployment of the SMR-300 in the UK. Holtec said the GDA would proceed in parallel with its “ongoing pre-application dialogue” with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other regulators. Holtec noted that it has been a prominent supplier of goods and services to the UK nuclear programme for over 25 years and “has assembled a strong team of British companies including Mott MacDonald, along with Team Holtec’s global alliance partners, Hyundai E&C (Seoul, Korea) and Mitsubishi Electric (Kobe, Japan)”.",
            "UK Minister for Nuclear Andrew Bowie said: “As the Government that revitalized the UK nuclear industry, committing public funds to nuclear for the first time in a generation, we’re rapidly expanding our nuclear power capacity to move towards a cleaner energy mix and help deliver net zero. Today’s news represents a multi-million investment to develop cutting-edge technology which could transform how power stations are built by making construction faster and cheaper.”",
            "Holtec is also participating in the Great British Nuclear SMR competition. The UK Government aims to announce in 2024, which companies the government will support for technology deployment. “We are planning a large expansion in the region should Holtec be successful in the Great British Nuclear competition, locating a factory to build the major mechanical SMR components and other aligned areas of business (clean energy & defense) to support deployment of 5 GW+ of on-grid UK electricity by 2050,” Holtec said, adding that it “is committed to UK job creation by the thousands, serving as a long-term strategic partner to the UK”.",

        "text": [
            "US-based Holtec International has launched a programme to build two SMR-300 reactor units at the Palisades NPP site in Michigan. Holtec said it is encouraged by the state’s “commitment to expand in-state carbon-free generation as well as by the broad-based federal, state, and community support for repowering the Palisades NPP”.",
            "In October, Holtec said it had submitted a filing with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to begin the process of seeking federal reauthorisation of power operations at the Palisades NPP. The single-unit 800 MWe pressurised water reactor at Palisades began commercial operation in 1971. Operator Entergy announced in 2016 announced plans to close the plant in 2021and NRC approved transfer of the licence from Entergy to Holtec in preparation for its decommissioning. The reactor was removed from service by Entergy in May 2022, and was defuelled. Its sale to Holtec was completed in June 2022. Holtec then announced that it was applying for federal funding to allow restart of the plant.",
            "Holtec says the Palisades plant “refurbished with an array of enhancements is on track to be restarted by the end of 2025 and is designed to provide decades of safe and reliable service”. The addition of two Holtec SMRs will nearly double the site’s generation capacity. The filing of the Construction Permit Application (CPA) for the SMRs is targeted for 2026, shortly after the Palisades NPP returns to service, Holtec noted. Target commissioning date for the first SMR-300 plant is mid-2030, subject to NRC’s r reviews and oversight.",
            "“Siting the first two SMR-300 units at Palisades eliminates the delays associated with erecting the plant at an undeveloped property and confers the many benefits of synergy that accrue from the presence of a co-located operating plant – including shared infrastructure and operational expertise, enhancements to grid stability, and resource optimisation,” said Holtec’s CEO Dr Kris Singh.",
            "“By building at our own site with our own credit and our own at-risk funds, we hope to deliver the dual-unit SMR-300 plant within schedule and budget – an outcome that has eluded our industry for a long time. We thank our federal, state, and community partners for their critical support, which have made the Palisades re-start and our pioneering SMR-300 construction in Michigan feasible,” he noted.",
            "Holtec’s SMR has been in development since 2011 undergoing several design evolutions. The SMR-160 advanced SMR is a pressurised light-water reactor, generating 160MWe (525MWt) using low-enriched uranium fuel, with flexibility to produce process heat for industrial applications and hydrogen production. The design has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's three-phase pre-licensing vendor design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with NRC. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "The larger SMR-300 design is intended to be deployable in virtually any terrain, including those with significant seismic loadings. The Plant is also readily adaptable for diverting all or some of its cycle steam for other purposes such as hydrogen production and industrial thermal needs. The most recent design evolution is the incorporation of forced flow capability overlayed on gravity-driven flow in the plant’s primary system.",
            "The addition of booster pumps for normal operations does not change the plant’s essential safety features, as the pumps are not relied upon for safe shutdown operations. Holtec says the SMR-300 remains “walk-away safe” with its redundant passive safety systems that operate without any operator action nor any external source of electricity or cooling water. The power uprate “has the added critical benefit of aligning the reactor’s embodiment with the existing US Code of Federal Regulations, eliminating the need for certain exemptions from them, and thus making the uprated plant more conducive to timely licensing by the NRC and other overseas regulatory authorities”.",
            "Holtec’s 700-acre Oyster Creek site in Central New Jersey is alsobeing considered for early SMR-300 deploymen. The 600 MWe NPP shut down in 2018 and has been substantially decommissioned The focus for deployment of the SMR-300 at Oyster Creek is hydrogen production given ongoing electricity market dynamics, Holtec noted. The technical assessments will advance deployment of SMR-300s at Oyster Creek to accord with the mission of a recent DOE award to the Mid-Atlantic Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub (MACH2), of which Holtec is a member.",

            "The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission has granted Holtec Decommissioning International’s request to revise the emergency preparedness plan for the Indian Point NPP in Buchanan, New York, to reflect the plant’s decommissioning status. The approved exemptions will enable Holtec to establish and maintain an adequate level of radiological emergency preparedness during decommissioning. NRC said these exemptions are consistent with its actions at other decommissioning plants. Once Holtec implements the changes, state and local governments may rely on a comprehensive emergency management plan approach (all hazards) for offsite emergency response.",
            "A 10-mile emergency planning zone is no longer required but Holtec must continue to maintain an onsite emergency plan and response capabilities at Indian Point. This includes the continued notification of state government officials in the event of an emergency declaration. After a NPP has permanently ceased operations and removed fuel from the reactor vessel, the risk of an offsite radiological release is significantly lower, and the types of possible accidents significantly fewer, than at an operating reactor. NRC staff evaluated and confirmed analyses in Holtec’s request and considered comments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Based on the NRC staff’s evaluation and recommendation, the Commission approved the exemptions.",
            "The exemptions and associated licence amendments reflecting the changes will be issued in the next few weeks. Indian Point has three pressurised-water reactors, located along the Hudson River, about 24 miles north of New York City. Unit 1 shut down in 1974. Units 2&3 ceased operations in 2020 and 2021, respectively. All fuel has been removed from the used fuel pools and placed in dry storage on the site.",
            "Indian Point enter was shut down permanently by Entergy in April 2021, after almost 60 years. In May 2021, Indian Point was purchased by Holtec International in a deal that allowed the site to enter immediate decommissioning. This enables decommissioning and site release for alternate uses decades sooner than previously anticipated.",

The government and GBM said the chosen designs are considered as the most able to deliver operational SMRs by the mid-2030s. The next stage of the process will be launched as soon as possible where successful companies will shortly be able to bid for government contracts. The aim is to announce in Spring 2024 which of the companies the government will support, with contracts awarded by Summer 2024. “This timetable aims to make this competition the fastest of its kind in the world,” DESNZ noted.",
            "The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) competition is part of the government’s plan to revive nuclear power and for the UK to lead the global race to develop cutting-edge technologies to rapidly deliver cleaner, cheaper energy and greater energy security. The government aims for up to a quarter of all UK electricity to come from nuclear power by 2050. The statement pointed out that, “as well as backing SMRs and other emerging nuclear technologies, the government is also investing in the large-scale project at Sizewell C, a near exact replica of Hinkley Point C, the first nuclear plant to be in construction for over a generation”.",
            "Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho said SMRs “will help the UK rapidly expand nuclear power and deliver cheaper, cleaner, and more secure energy for British families and businesses, create well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and grow the economy”. She added: “This competition has attracted designs from around the world and puts the UK at the front of the global race to develop this exciting, cutting-edge technology and cement our position as a world leader in nuclear innovation.”",
            "Minister for Nuclear & Networks Andrew Bowie said the programme “provides the blueprint for how the government can work together with industry to grow the economy and set the future of new, exciting nuclear technologies”.",
            "Gwen Parry-Jones, GBN CEO, said: “Our priority in this process has been to prioritise reliable and sustainable power to the grid early, and that’s why we have focused our first step on the technologies that we viewed as most likely to meet the objective of a final investment decision in 2029. These companies will now be able to prepare for the next stages of the competition, aiming for a final contract agreement in the summer, potentially benefiting from significant support from the public purse.”",
            "The government’s objective has been to select technologies which offer the greatest confidence in being able to make a final investment decision in 2029 and be operational in the mid-2030s.",
            "For companies who were not successful in this initial process, the next opportunity could be the government’s consultation on alternative routes to market for nuclear technologies which is due to be launched soon. This will look at how to support newer technologies so that the UK can benefit from them as well.",
            "The government is set to consult later in the year on how best to ensure other nuclear technologies can potentially get underway in the UK – and this could include some of the technologies that were not selected through this process.",
            "The six technologies selected all depend to a large extent on traditional nuclear technology. The 470 MWe Rolls-Royce SMR design is based on a small pressurised water reactor. The design was accepted for UK Generic Design Assessment review in March 2022 and Rolls-Royce SMR expects to receive UK regulatory approval by mid-2024. A Rolls-Royce-led UK SMR consortium aims to build 16 SMRs. The consortium – which includes Assystem, Atkins, BAM Nuttall, Jacobs, Laing O'Rourke, National Nuclear Laboratory, the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre and TWI – expects to complete its first unit in the early 2030s and build up to 10 by 2035.",

            "The company noted that the SMR will also be able to provide energy for the manufacture of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. It will occupy approximately one tenth of the size of a conventional nuclear generation site, thereby reducing local ecological impacts. The SMR will be factory built, enabling completed modules to be transported by truck, train or barge, reducing vehicle movements and completion risk and increasing build time certainty.",

            "A US appeals court has cancelled a licence granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to a company planning construction of a temporary nuclear waste storage facility in Andrews County, western Texas. The New Orleans-based 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals found that NRC lacked the authority under federal law to issue permits for private, temporary nuclear waste storage sites.",
            "The licence, issued in 2021 to Interim Storage Partners, had been challenged by Texas as well as west Texas oil and gas interests. Interim Storage Partners is a joint venture of Waste Control Specialists and Orano CIS, a subsidiary of Orano USA.",
            "Circuit Judge James Ho agreed with Texas that the Atomic Energy Act does not give the agency the broad authority \"to license a private, away-from-reactor storage facility for spent nuclear fuel”.",
            "He added that a licence for that kind of a facility also conflicts with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which prioritises permanent storage solutions permitting temporary storage of nuclear waste only at NPP or federal sites.",
            "Texas Governor Greg Abbott and other state officials had petitioned the court in 2021 to review NRC’s order authorising Interim Storage Partners to receive and store up to 5,000 tonnes of used fuel and about 230 tonnes of low-level radioactive waste for 40 years at the planned repository. The Andrews County site is about 350 miles (563.27km) west of Dallas, near the Texas-New Mexico border.",
            "New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the state’s congressional delegation have been similarly fighting a proposal by Holtec International to build a facility in Lea County. However, in July, Holtec received the final licence from the NRC for construction and operation of the facility, which is intended to temporarily store nuclear waste from NPPs across the USA.",
            "NRC issued the licence despite strong opposition the passage of a new law in New Mexico that seeks to block the facility by requiring a federal permanent repository to be in operation before any nuclear waste can be stored. State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard said in a press statement: “Placing a nuclear storage facility in the heart of oil and gas operations is a recipe for ecological disaster and unnecessarily puts New Mexicans at risk.” There are some 2,500 oil, gas or mineral extraction sites operated by 54 different entities within 10 miles of the site where Holtec plans to build the facility.",
            "In the 1980s, the Department of Energy (DOE) and Congress approved construction of a permanent, deep underground burial site at Yucca Mountain in southern Nevada. State officials fought the project for years, however, and, although construction had begun, Congress eliminated funding for it in 2011."

            "The 16th and final HI-STORM FW dry storage system has been placed into the dry storage building at the Krško NPP in Slovenia, US-based Holtec International said on its Facebook page. Slovenian nuclear utility Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško’s (NEK’s) used fuel dry storage facility at Krško NPP was commissioned ahead of schedule in April with the placement by Holtec of the first cask. Placement of the 16th cask marks completion of the first loading campaign Holtec noted. “We thank our partners at NEK for their support in project preparation and execution that led us to such a successful conclusion.”",
            "Transfer to dry storage of the 16 casks containing 592 used fuel rods was supervised by the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (URSJV – Uprava republike Slovenije za jedrsko varnost) and monitored by other authorised organisations. NEK says the dry storage will meet all the conditions needed for extended operation of the Krško NPP for an additional 20 years (to 2043), for which it has a final environmental consent.",
            "Construction of the 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor – first western NPP in eastern Europe – began in 1975 and it began commercial operation in 1983. Construction of the dry storage facility began after Holtec won the contract in 2017.",
            "The HI-STORM FW casks are qualified to a severe earthquake level that produces foundation pad accelerations 2.1 times higher than the earth’s gravity. They are also engineered to withstand impact from a military or commercial aircraft, exceeding the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) guidance for operating NPPs.",
            "NEK says the technology provides a high level of safety for workers and the environment during the transfer of the used fuel elements from the pool to containers and the transport of the containers to the dry storage as well as for the entire period of temporary storage. The containers can also be used to transport the used fuel to a final repository in future.",

            "The Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) has published a 60-page supplement to “The NEA Small Modular Reactor Dashboard”, which it published in March. The Dashboard tracks the progress of selected small modular reactor (SMR) designs towards deployment.",
            "NEA says it looks beyond technical feasibility and defines new criteria for assessing real progress in six additional dimensions of readiness: licensing, siting, financing, supply chain, engagement, and fuel. The first volume assessed the progress of 21 SMRs and the second volume tracks the progress of an additional 21 SMRs.",
            "NEA says it used information from verifiable public sources mostly from third party references (governments, regulators, financiers, operators). None of the sources are from the SMR designers, except for some relating to fuel type, enrichment, reactor specifics and public announcements of financing. Prior to publication, the SMR designers were consulted by the NEA and “were given the opportunity to comment on the draft assessments and supplement further information which could be independently verified”.",
            "Future volumes of Dashboard “will aim to help public and private sector decision-makers understand the pace of progress to commercial deployment”. However, neither the original document nor its supplement contains projected completion dates, which are a key measure for assessing progress. Moreover, the selection of SMRs chosen seems somewhat random as the two volumes together cover only 42 reactors in 13 countries. By comparison, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) most recent edition of its biennial IAEA booklet, Advances in Small Modular Reactor Technology Developments, published in 2022 covers 83 designs under development or construction in 18 countries.",

            "The HI-STORE CISF will temporarily store nuclear waste from nuclear power plants across the USA. (Credit: Markus Distelrath from Pixabay)",
            "Holtec International has received the final licence from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for construction and operation of a waste storage facility in Lea County, southeast New Mexico. The site will temporarily store nuclear waste from nuclear power plants across the USA.",
            "The HI-STORE Consolidated Interim Storage Facility (CISF) will be built on land provided by the Eddy Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA), a regional economic development authority. Holtec said this was “the culmination of an eight-year process” for an “inherently safe below-ground storage system called the HI-STORM UMAX”.",
            "According to Holtec, southeastern New Mexico is the ideal location for the CISF, which will be located on a small and isolated portion of a thousand acres of undeveloped ELEA land that is geologically stable, with a dry and arid climate that is ideal for the underground dry fuel storage system. Aggregating the used fuel from all 75 sites at a consolidated facility would make the task of securing them from known and unknown threats much easier, Holtec says, adding that storing the canisters in a canister- friendly climate such as New Mexico’s will remove their vulnerability to salt air corrosion saving the economy hundreds of millions of dollars in averted aging management costs and remedial programmes.",
            "NRC said the licence “authorises the company to receive, possess, transfer and store 500 canisters holding approximately 8,680 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel for 40 years”. Holtec plans to eventually store up to 10,000 canisters in an additional 19 phases. NRC said each expansion phase would require a licence amendment with additional NRC safety and environmental reviews. The used fuel “must be stored in canisters and cask systems certified by the NRC as meeting standards for protection against leakage, radiation dose rates, and criticality under normal and accident conditions”. NRC specified that the canisters are required to be sealed prior to arrival at the facility. “They will be inspected upon arrival and will remain sealed during onsite handling and storage activities.”",
            "Used nuclear fuel will arrive at the CISF by rail in transport casks and using specialty-designed railcars. Three NRC-licenced transportation casks designed by Holtec – HI-STAR 190, HI-STAR 100 and HI-STAR 100MB ¬– may be used to move used nuclear fuel from the reactor sites to the CISF.",
            "Holtec said the HI-STORE facility is the first in the world to deploy a below-ground storage system for consolidated interim storage.",
            "“We thank the nuclear-savvy communities of the Southeast New Mexico region and their visionary leaders who have welcomed us to bring our technologies to create environmentally benign and well-paying jobs, and help diversify the region’s economy thus fostering a stable industrial base,” said Holtec President & CEO, Dr Kris Singh in a statement.",
            "Holtec’s expected contribution to the community includes additional economic development opportunities, such as a state-of-the art manufacturing facility, a technology development cente and a global workforce training centre.",
            "NRC’s review of the licence application included a technical safety and security review, an environmental impact review and adjudication before an Atomic Safety & Licensing Board. A safety evaluation report, documenting the technical review, was issued along with the licence. This followed a final environmental impact statement (EIS) that noted the absence of any environmental impacts that would preclude a licence for HI-STORE. It also confirmed that there are no adverse impacts to other enterprises in the area including oil and gas, potash, ranching, and farming.",
            "NRC’s recommendation was based on its review of Holtec’s licence application; consultation with Federal, State, Tribal and local agencies; input from other stakeholders; independent consultation with the New Mexico Bureau of Land Management; and NRC’s own environmental review.",
            "Alongside Holtec’s CISF, NRC notes that it has previously issued similar licenses for away-from-reactor storage installations. Private Fuel Storage received a license in 2006 although it was never constructed. The NRC also issued a license to Interim Storage Partners LLC in September 2021 for a proposed storage site in Andrews, Texas. ISP has not yet initiated construction.",
            "NRC issued the licence despite a backlash from the state of New Mexico, including the passage of a new law that seeks to block the facility by requiring a federal permanent repository to be in operation before any nuclear waste can be stored.",
            "Program Director for the HI-STORE CISF, US Navy Captain (retired) Ed Mayer stated, “Thanks to the local support, we have persevered for the past eight years to license HI-STORE in spite of variable enthusiasm from the State’s authorities. However local protests continue. In the 2023 legislative session, New Mexico passed Senate Bill 53, which bans state agencies from granting permits, contracts or leases for building a high-level nuclear waste storage facility.

            "US-based Holtec International is using its HI-LIFT heavy load handling technology to speed up decommissioning work at unit 3 of the US Indian Point NPP in Buchanan, New York State.",
            "All three units at the Indian Point Energy Centre have been closed for decommissioning. Unit 1, a 257 MWe pressurised water reactor operated between 1962 and 1974. Unit 2 was closed in April 2020, and unit 3 in April 2021, after 45 years in operation. Holtec purchased of the Indian Point Energy Centre from Entergy in June 2021 to undertake its decommissioning. Holtec expects decommissioning is take 12-15 years.",
            "HI-LIFT enables NPPs to safely load heavy modern casks and canisters even though the cranes installed to help with construction and operation cranes do not have sufficient capacity. In addition, the structural strength of the plant’s load bearing walls is often inadequate.",
            "HI-LIFT was first conceived, patented, designed, built and deployed at Pacific Gas & Electric’s (PG&E) Humboldt Bay Power Plant, decommissioned more than a decade ago. The crane there dated back to 1947 and wall structure supporting the crane was qualified for just 40 tons. The Humboldt Bay HI-LIFT safely handled Holtec’s HI-STAR HB dual purpose casks without stressing the existing crane or its supporting walls. This saved PG&E substantial decommissioning funds and made possible an accelerated schedule, reducing the project’s duration by three years, avoiding the need to strengthen the load bearing walls and install a new high-capacity bridge crane.",
            "Holtec’s defuelling at Indian Point 3 faced the same crane capacity problem that it had confronted its sister plant, Indian Point unit 2. The previous owner reportedly spent over $60m to upgrade the crane to 110 tons and strengthen the supporting walls. Using the HI-LIFT technology, Holtec engineered and installed the 100-ton HI-LIFT crane for less than $10m",
            "The HI-LIFT technology enables the heavy payload to be safely transferred to the plant’s foundation using the structurally competent portion of the building, bypassing the weak regions such as the load bearing walls. HI-LIFT was approved by the NRC for Humboldt Bay a decade ago and recently for Indian Point 3, as a single-failure–proof load handling device. It has been manufactured as a safety-significant structure at the Holtec Manufacturing Division in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
            "Holtec says the HI-LIFT provides a proven solution to overcome the limitation in the civil/structural load bearing capacity of many nuclear power plants built in the 1960s and 70s when heavy casks, used universally in dry storage projects, did not exist. Using the HI-LIFT system is expected to streamline and reduce the number of used fuel movements needed to defuel Indian Point 3 so that the defuelling campaign will take only six months.",

Bottom line, the world’s most active oil and gas producing field is not the right place for a long-term nuclear waste storage site.” There are some 2,500 oil, gas or mineral extraction sites operated by 54 different entities within 10 miles of the site where Holtec plans to build the facility.",
            "In addition to the new law, there are two lawsuits pending before federal court that aim to block planned consolidated interim storage facilities. These include Holtec’s proposed facility in New Mexico as well as another in Texas that received a licence in 2021. The lawsuits have been pending before the courts for years citing concerns over transportation of the nuclear materials. “Transporting highly radioactive waste is inherently high-risk,” Kevin Kamps, a radioactive waste specialist with Beyond Nuclear, said in a press release. “Fully loaded irradiated nuclear fuel containers would be among the very heaviest loads on the roads, rails, and waterways.… Even if our nation’s infrastructure gets renovated someday, the shipping containers themselves will remain vulnerable to severe accidents and terrorist attacks.”",

            "South Korean national financial institutions K-Sure (Korea Trade Insurance Corporation) and Kexim (Export-Import Bank of Korea) have both signed agreements with US-based Holtec International and Korea’s Hyundai Engineering & Construction to provide financial support for SMR-160 projects around the world.",
            "Holtec's 160 MWe small modular reactor (SMR) is a pressurised light-water reactor using low-enriched uranium fuel. The reactor core and nuclear steam supply system components would be located underground, according to the design. Other features include a passive cooling system that would be able to operate indefinitely after shutdown. No active components, such as pumps, are needed to run the reactor, which does not need any on-site or off-site power to shut down and to dissipate decay heat.",
            "The design, which has been in development since 2010, has completed the first phase of the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission's three-phase pre-licensing vendor design review and is undergoing pre-licensing activities with the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Holtec has also applied for a Generic Design Assessment of the SMR-160 in the UK.",
            "Holtec’s collaboration agreement with Hyundai E&C and K-Sure was announced during the Korea-US Advanced Industry & Clean Energy Partnership Event hosted by Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy in Washington DC in April. Holtec said the agreement calls for \"an expansion of nuclear power plant deployments to underpin the global growth of clean energy and decarbonisation of the environment\". Hyundai E&C said it expected the agreement to accelerate the global advancement of the Korean NPP business “by establishing a multilateral support system of public financial institutions for technical cooperation between Hyundai E&C and Holtec”.",
            "Holtec and Hyundai E&C also signed a financial support agreement with Kexim to \"facilitate the adoption of SMR-160 reactors around the globe promoting the urgently needed decarbonisation of the environment\".",
            "In November 2021, Holtec and Hyundai E&C signed a teaming agreement whereby Hyundai E&C will perform the detailed design of the balance of plant and prepare the full plant construction specification for the SMR-160. Hyundai will also develop the integrated 3D plant model for construction using its Building Information Modelling management process. The partnership also provides for conditional project delivery rights for Hyundai. In October 2022, it was agreed to accelerate the programme to complete the balance of plant design of the remaining systems and structures.",
            "During the Washington event, Kexin President & Chairman Hee-sung Yoon recalled the key role played by Hyundai founder u-yung Chung, in shaping the inception and rise of the Kexim bank and pledged his support to the Hyundai/Holtec team for the deployment of SMR-160 reactors. Holtec CEO Dr Kris Singh welcomed the strong business ties forged by Holtec and Hyundai while Hyundai E&C CEO Young-joon Yoon expressed his unwavering commitment to ensure the success of the Hyundai/Holtec partnership.",

The biennial nuclear sector business and technology fair, promoted by the Brazilian Association for the Development of Nuclear Activities (ABDAN) is the biggest nuclear event in Latin America. It attracted many leading companies such as as Framatome, Rosatom, Westinghouse, Holtec, ENBPar, Eletronuclear, Amazul, Andrade Gutierrez, Nuclep, BNDES and Sebrae.",
            "INB signed three contracts with Westinghouse. Under one, Westinghouse will hire INB to supply specialised labour for handling fuel in the USA. Under the other two, INB contracted Westinghouse for the supply of metallic components and gadolinium rods for Angra 1 reloads and for development of a project for the component “protective grade” for fuel elements.",
            "INB also signed two agreements with Brazil’s Institute for Energy & Nuclear Research (IPEN) for a research partnership, and development of studies and technologies related to the production of fuel elements.",
            "A contract was also signed with Rosatom/Tenex, for the supply of natural UF6 (uranium hexafluoride). It follows a tender won last year for the supply of 330 tonnes of UF6 to Brazil. Rosatom Deputy Director General Kirill Komarov said: \"We continue to develop cooperation with the Brazilian company INB on the supply of uranium products. Last year, we won an international tender and signed a contract for the supply of uranium enrichment services. Another contract for the supply of natural uranium was signed in Rio de Janeiro today. \"",
            "During the opening of the event, ABDAN President Celso Cunha, stated that Brazil has an important mission: to convince the government that the country can become one of the world's biggest players in the nuclear sector. Brazil has the sixth largest uranium reserve in the world, already produces nuclear fuel and has the capacity to expand this production, he said.",
            "Cunha pointed out that under its 10-year energy plan, Brazil envisages the construction of a new 1,000 MWe NPP in addition to the completion of unit 3 at the Angra NPP. He added that nuclear technology also plays a fundamental role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially in the fight against cancer. highlighted the relevance of this technology for public health and the advancement of medicine in Brazil.",
            "Kirill Komarov pointed out the role of state support for nuclear projects: “There are several world leaders in the construction of nuclear power plants including China, India, Russia and some countries of the Arab world. The governments of all these countries provide considerable support to nuclear projects while also directly participating in their implementation. Nuclear energy development is certainly impossible without government support.”",

The MOU also included technical support to better promote and supply NuScale Power's VOYGR SMRs to the global market. NuScale will be able to use Korea's global supply chains to build its SMRs.",
            "This is a further step in a relationship between Doosan Enerbility and NuScale dating back to 2019 when they jointly agreed on investment of $104m. At the end of 2022, NuScale placed the first upper reactor pressure vessel long lead material production order with Doosan. Then in March 2023, the two signed an agreement to manufacture SMRs to be supplied to the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems (UAMPS), a power plant project scheduled to be completed by 2029. John Hopkins, President & CEO of NuScale Power, said: “The momentum towards creating a domestic and global supply chain to deploy our SMR technology is accelerating.”",

SMRs are a powerful technology that would also allow us to decentralise the generation. Ukraine has significant human potential for the development of advanced nuclear technologies and will make maximum efforts, in particular in cooperation with American partners, to remove the Russian nuclear industry from the world market.”",

        "text": [
            "The US has sensitive nuclear technology at a nuclear power plant inside Ukraine and is warning Russia not to touch it, according to a letter the US Department of Energy (DOE) sent to Rosatom, CNN reported. The letter, from the director of DOE’s Office of Nonproliferation Policy, Andrea Ferkile, was dated 17 March 2023. It tells Rosatom’s director general that the Zaporizhia nuclear power plant in Enerhodar “contains US-origin nuclear technical data that is export-controlled by the United States Government”.",
            "Since Russia took control of ZNPP in March 2022, the Russian national guard has been protecting the station and in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree formally transferring ZNPP to Russian jurisdiction under nuclear utility Rosenergoatom (part of Rosatom). A Russian Federal State Unitary Enterprise. Zaporizhia NPP was established by Rosenergoatom to operate the plant. ZNPP has been subjected to repeated shelling and drone attacks as well as several major military operations by Ukrainian forces to take back control of the facility.",
            "The DOE letter says: “It is unlawful under United States law for non-authorised persons, including, but not limited to, Russian citizens and Russian entities, such as Rosatom and its subsidiaries, to knowingly and wilfully access, possess, control, export, store, seize, review, re-export, ship, transfer, copy, manipulate such technology or technical data, or direct, or authorise others to do the same, without such Russian entities becoming authorised recipients by the Secretary of the US Department of Energy.”",
            "It is not clear whether Rosatom has responded to the letter. “The Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration can confirm that the letter is legitimate,” said Shayela Hassan, the deputy director of public affairs for the National Nuclear Security Administration. She added: “The Secretary of Energy has the statutory responsibility for authorising the transfer of unclassified civilian nuclear technology and assistance to foreign atomic energy activities. DOE does not comment on regulatory activities.”",
            "Another letter from Ferkile to the Energy Department’s Inspector General, reviewed by CNN and dated 24 October 24 2022, outlines the technology the US has exported to Ukraine for use ZNPP and reiterates that the department has “no record of any current authorisation to transfer this technology and technical data to any Russian national or entity”. DOE’s Office of Nuclear Energy stated on its website in June 2021 that “the United States helped implement new maintenance procedures and operations at the reactor that should ultimately strengthen energy security” in Ukraine.",
            "US technologies at ZNPP largely concern Westinghouse-supplied nuclear fuel, a used fuel dry storage facility built by Holtec and software related to operation of the six units, none of which is of any interest to Rosatom, according to the large number of Russian scientists and nuclear experts who commented on the DOE letter.",
            "All of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities are based on Soviet and Russian technology and its NPPs originally depended on nuclear fuel supplied by TVEL, which was taken back to Russia for reprocessing. However, nuclear utility Energoatom, encouraged by the US, began a fuel diversification policy and began implementing the Ukraine Nuclear Fuel Qualification Project (UNFQP) for VVER-1000 fuel. The Project assumed the use of Western-manufactured fuel in VVER-1000 reactors with Westinghouse selected as vendor.",
            "In 2005, South Ukraine's third unit was the country's first to use the six lead test assemblies supplied by Westinghouse placed into the reactor core together with Russian fuel for a period of pilot operation. A reload batch of 42 fuel assemblies was provided by Westinghouse in mid-2009 for a three-year period. Under a 2008 contract, Westinghouse supplied a total of 630 fuel assemblies for South Ukraine 2&3. However, the fuel caused serious damage to one of the reactors and in 2010 Energoatom signed a long-term fuel supply contract with TVEL for all 15 reactors. Westinghouse fuel had earlier also caused problems at the Loviisa NPP in Finland and the Temelin NPP in the Czech Republic.",
            "Following the annexation of Crimea by Russia, in 2014, Ukraine again turned to the US and extended its 2008 contract with Westinghouse for fuel supply to 2020. In 2015 Energoatom ordered Westinghouse fuel for ZNPP unit 5 as well as for South Ukraine. Despite continued warnings from Russia about the safety of the Westinghouse fuel, by 2021, six of Ukraine's 15 reactors were using it: South Ukraine 2&3 and four units at ZNPP. Because Westinghouse, unlike TVEL, does not take back the used fuel, Ukraine contracted US Holtec to build a a long-term dry storage facility for used fuel at ZNPP, which has operated since 2001.",
            "Commenting on the DOE letter, there is a general consensus among Russian experts that there are really no critical US technologies at ZNPP that are of any use to Rosatom. According to nuclear energy expert Alexey Anpilogov, President of the Foundation for Support of Scientific Research and Development of Civil Initiatives Research: \"There are two main points that distinguished the four Ukrainian NPPs from the Russian ones, they are the Westinghouse alternative nuclear fuel (TVS-W) and the dry storage of used raw materials, which was built by Holtec in Energodar. Everything else works on Soviet technologies.”",
            "He added that, when the US began adapting Ukrainian NPPs to enable their use of Westinghouse fuel in 2008 nuclear fuel, Rosatom withdrew its guarantees for those plant. The decision was not political, he explains, noting that the use of US fuel assemblies in Soviet reactors at the Finnish Loviisa NPP had revealed the shortcomings and that their use in Ukraine confirmed those concerns. “After the arrival of Westinghouse, Ukraine operated ZNPP at its own risk. Practice has shown that TVS-W fuel is less reliable than Russian fuel elements, and it is questionable from an economic point of view,” he said.",
            "He noted that Westinghouse fuel for VVER reactors is not a 100% copy of TVEL’s fuel. “They have a certain share of their own experience. But by God, it would be better to have a full copy… everyone who tried to use Westinghouse assemblies encountered huge problems.” Citing the fuel deformations that occurred in Loviisa, Temelin and South Ukraine, he said: “So, whether the Americans want it or not, we will touch their fuel. Because there is no choice. These dangerous assemblies have to be removed from the plant.\"",
            "He noted that the fuel “operates with a longer cycle between refuellings, which is achieved with increased enrichment.” This also makes TVS-W more expensive than Russian fuel. He added that the need to build used fuel storage facilities at ZNPP had also increased costs. “Rosatom includes disposal in the cost of nuclear fuel supply. Working with the United States has increased Ukraine's costs and reduced the safety of its nuclear industry,\" Anpilogov concluded. “But the choice of American fuel, rather than Russian, was always dictated by political reasons,\" he asserted. \"The technologies that the Americans left behind at ZNPP have no sensitive significance for Rosatom. The station's equipment can be quickly returned to factory settings.\"",
            "Nuclear scientist Alexander Uvarov, Director of AtomInfo-Centre, confirmed that: “There are no secrets or special technologies at ZNPP, but there may be commercial secrets.\" This may relate to software, he explained. He said the US has been writing letters since last year saying that in accordance with agreements, this American software should not be touched. “It's just that CNN has only just noticed it. And, apparently, for a reason,” he said. “A number of countries are now pushing the European Union to impose the toughest possible sanctions against Rosatom and its subsidiaries,” he noted. .",
            "He said the supplied software is mainly engineering programs designed for the operation of specific power units of the plant. This includes RELAP simulation software and neutronics codes that have been adapted to the needs of Westinghouse. “And let's be honest: in most cases, RELAP is not even used by professionals anymore”. He explained that “These engineering programs are of no scientific or technical interest to us…. We have our own calculation complexes, and in a fairly large number. After all, the VVER-1000s at ZNPP are our reactors.” He added: “If I were a student, I would still look through their documentation out of curiosity, but no one will take it seriously. But to give this event more weight, CNN and called it ‘nuclear technical data of American origin’.",
            "Currently VNPP unit 1,3,4 & 5 use Westinghouse fuel and reserves will last for four years. However, it is planned to replace it completely with Russian fuel, Renat Karchaa, adviser to the Director of Russian nuclear utility Rosenergoatom Concern, told Interfax. \"Theoretically, the current reserves of American fuel are for about four years. But its replacement with the Russian fuel will begin much earlier. We don't need American fuel, nor do we need their technologies. We have our own regulations,” he said.",
            "Alexey Anpilogov told VZGLYAD newspaper that the DOE letter could be a pretext for imposing sanctions on Rosatom. \"Everyone understands perfectly well that the ZNPP will remain under Russian control, it is impossible to remove the power units and American technologies, so the United States is creating a media hype. Perhaps in the future, Washington will initiate lawsuits against Rosatom for allegedly disclosing secret technologies or lost profits.” He commented: “American companies have lost a lot of key positions in the nuclear production market and lost a number of tenders to Rosatom. Naturally, in most cases we are not talking about the European continent, where we are now banned, but about Africa and Asia.\"",
            "Maxim Shingarkin, ecologist and former Russian Duma member, said: “The Russian Federation can throw this [DOE] letter in the trash, and not inform anyone about what is happening at the nuclear facility, which is the property of the Russian Federation. We have to unload the dangerous fuel. If the Americans come and take it away along with the used nuclear fuel, it will be just fine. We will only welcome it if the Americans take home their dangerous materials.”"

            "Slovenian nuclear utility Nuklearna Elektrarna Krško (NEK) says the new used fuel dry storage facility at its Krško NPP has been commissioned with the placement by US-based Holtec International of the first HI-STORM FW cask. NEK received the operating licence for the facility from the Slovenian Nuclear Safety Administration (URSJV – Uprava republike Slovenije za jedrsko varnost) in October 2022. Holtec said the first fuel loading campaign will see 16 HI-STORM FW casks placed into the facility.",
            "NEK said the introduction of dry storage for used fuel represents “a transition from active to passive solutions, as no additional device, system or energy source is needed to provide cooling”. NEK added that it was necessary to carry out several administrative procedures in accordance with spatial, environmental, construction and nuclear legislation. “We successfully completed the process of amending and supplementing the NPP Regulatory Plan, which included a comprehensive environmental impact assessment and cross-border consultation with Croatia and Austria, in March 2020. We obtained an integral building permit in February 2021.” An environmental and cross-border impact assessment was also carried out.",
            "The storage facility measures 50 by 70 by 20 metres. The reinforced concrete base plate is 1.75 metres thick, and along with the perimeter walls, provides stability for anchoring the storage containers in place. Monitoring of radiation and temperature is installed as well as the required infrastructure for monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
            "The used fuel will be stored in casks each holding 37 fuel rods. The thick concrete shell provides mechanical and radiological protection. Cooling is provided by free air flow. Holtec says the facility is designed to withstand earthquake levels only encountered in high seismic regions of the world, such as California and the Western Pacific, although the seismic hazard at the site is not that high. It is also designed to function under severe flood conditions and to attenuate the accreted dose from the facility to minuscule levels to protect public health and safety. Construction involved rigorous quality assurance controls and local supply chain management, primarily consisting of Slovenian, Croatian and Italian companies.",
            "The seismic restraint system uses a robust steel structure embedded within the thick concrete foundation of the storage building. The HI-STORM FW casks are qualified to a severe earthquake level that produces foundation pad accelerations 2.1 times higher than the earth’s gravity. Furthermore, the storage modules are also engineered to withstand impact from a military or commercial aircraft, exceeding the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) guidance for operating nuclear power plants. The custom-engineered domed lid of the HI-STORM FW, unique to this project, is a Holtec innovation developed to engineer an impact-capable design.",
            "Holtec says that, as part of the transboundary commenting process, it was decided to implement a non-intrusive leak-indication system to continuously monitor the welded multi-purpose canisters containing the fuel. The system monitors the temperature profile of the casks to detect potential depressurisation. The HI-STORM FW system is designed and licensed as “leak-tight” and the monitoring system serves only as an additional safety measure.",
            "NEK said this technology provides a high level of safety for workers and the environment during the transfer of the used fuel elements from the pool to containers and the transport of the containers to the dry storage as well as for the entire period of temporary storage. The containers can also be used to transport the used fuel to a final repository in future. “In the first campaign, we will move 16 containers with 592 used fuel rods to dry storage by autumn. The transfer will be supervised by URSJV, and it will also be monitored by authorised organisations.",
            "Operation of the dry storage will meet all the conditions needed for the extension of the operation of the Krško NPP. The Krško NPP has a final environmental consent to extend its service life for an additional 20 years (to 2043). The 696 MWe Westinghouse pressurised water reactor was the first western NPP in eastern Europe. Construction started in 1975 and it began commercial operation in 1983.",
            "In accordance with Slovenian legislation, the third periodic safety inspection is underway during which URSJV ensures the NPP meets the criteria for operation over the next 10 years in accordance with the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It should be completed by the end of the year.",
            "“By moving the first 592 used fuel elements to a dry storage facility, we will complete the dry storage project. In this way, we will meet all the conditions and enforce the decisions of the administrative bodies for the extension of the operation of the Krško NPP,” NEK says.",

        "text": [
            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) has issued guidance for the second award cycle of the Civil Nuclear Credit (CNC) programme for nuclear power plants at risk of closing or have already been shut down. The guidance expands the number of reactors eligible for some of CNC’s $6bn in overall funding made available by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Civil nuclear credits of $1.2bn a year are available in fiscal years 2022 to 2026. Money not allocated will be available for future credits until spent or until September 2031.",
            "While the first award cycle limited eligibility to owners or operators of nuclear power reactors that had announced intentions to retire the plants within the four-year award period, the second cycle is extended to owners or operators of reactors at risk of closure by the end of the four-year award period. These include reactors that ceased operations after 15 November 2021.",
            "US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M Granholm said the CNC programme “made it abundantly clear that preserving the domestic nuclear fleet is critical to reaching America’s clean energy future”. She added: “Expanding the scope of this Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding will allow even more nuclear facilities the opportunity to continue operating as economic drivers in local communities that benefit from cheap, clean, and reliable power.”",
            "In November 2022, DOE announced the conditional selection of the Diablo Canyon NPP in California, to receive the first round of funding from the CNC programme. Units 1&2 of the power plant were scheduled to be decommissioned in 2024 and 2025, but the conditional award of credits, valued at up to $1.1bn, establishes a way to keep Diablo Canyon open, DOE said.",
            "The new conditions for this second round of funding should allow the Palisades NPP in Michigan to apply. It closed in May 2022, some two weeks before the planned date, after then-owner Entergy Corp discovered a coolant system leak. Current owner Holtec International, applied for funds under the first round of funding, but DOE rejected the application despite it being supported by former Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. In a letter to Granholm, he noted that plant provided about 600 highly paid jobs. In February, Holtec, which has said it will take more than $1bn to reopen Palisades, applied for an alternative source of funding, from the DOE's Loan Programs Office.",
            "Nuclear power accounts for half of carbon-free electricity in the USA, according to DOE. However, shifting energy markets and other economic factors have led to the early closures of 13 commercial reactors in the last decade. Closing NPPs can lead to an increase in air pollutants and carbon emissions that result in poorer air quality in surrounding areas and the loss of thousands of clean energy jobs, DOE said.",

        "text": [
            "Czech power utility ČEZ says it has tentatively identified two preferred construction sites for small modular reactors (SMRs), in addition to the Temelín pilot location. The two sites in Dětmarovice and Tušimice are currently coal-fired power plants, which are being transformed for emission-free operation. As part of its Vision 2030, ČEZ Group is committed to preparing for the construction of SMRs with a total capacity of over 1,000 MWe after 2040.",
            "In addition to these first three SMR construction sites, ČEZ is exploring other locations. These include the Prunéřov, Ledvice, Poříčí and Mělník coal sites as well as the Dukovany NPP. However, initial analysis has already recommended that the Poříčí power plant location should not be further developed due to the almost certain presence of a nearby active fault near the site, which precludes the placement of nuclear technology.",
            "\"Small modular reactors are not a substitute for large nuclear units, but a complement to the energy mix of the Czech Republic as a suitable replacement for coal-fired power plants and large thermal power plants,” says Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ Board of Directors and Chief Renewables Officer. “The SMR construction programme represents a great opportunity for the Czech economy. It offers production of nuclear equipment, substantial involvement in the supply chain, and the creation of a regional service and training centre.”",
            "He added: “In order to take advantage of the opportunities of the SMR programme, action must be taken quickly. We expect that new nuclear sources, including SMRs, will also be significantly represented in the upcoming update of the State Energy Concept. This, in the long term, builds the Czech energy mix on a combination of nuclear and renewable sources.\"",
            "The Dětmarovice and Tušimice power plant sites will undergo further intensive exploration and monitoring before it is finally clear whether they are suitable locations for a nuclear power source. The exploration work, which began in the first half of February, is primarily focused on excluding the existence of active tectonic faults, assessing the hydrogeology of the area and analysing the bedrock. This phase should be completed by the autumn and others will then follow. ČEZ noted that the transformation of a non-nuclear site into a nuclear site requires a series of exploration activities lasting 3-5 years before the permit process can begin.",
            "The first SMR will be built near the Temelín NPP and should be completed before the new large nuclear unit is launched at the site, which is planned for 2040. ČEZ cooperates with the South Bohemian region and its subsidiary ÚJV Řež as part of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park, which covers research, development and preparation for construction. While the investor for the SMR has yet to be decided the site has been decided. The area is part of the wider Temelín NPP site, which has recently undergone a special seismic mission.",
            "ČEZ Group has already signed a memoranda of cooperation om SMRs with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, Westinghouse, KHNP and Holtec. ČEZ says it is ready to participate in the scientific research activities and development of SMRS for all these companies through its ÚJV Řež subsidiary.",

        "text": [
            "Above: A local power range monitoring (LPRM) system measures neutron flux",
            "The emergence of the small modular reactor (SMR) sector is prompting capacity ramp ups across the supply chain as well as new designs for key equipment areas such as neutron detection. Reuter-Stokes, which has been designing and manufacturing neutron detection devices since the 1950s, is embracing these new opportunities.",
            "Rod Martinez, Reuter-Stokes Vice President, says: “in 1986 we became the OEM manufacturer of neutron sensors for boiling water reactors. Since then, we’ve been making neutron detectors for BWRs and PWRs and our company has expanded to not only provide neutron detection but auxiliary equipment. We’ve made the sensors that these companies need. With the emergence of SMR we’re helping these companies that are new names in the industry to design sensors too.”",
            "Reuter-Stokes has already made market in-roads, recently signing a contract with NuScale to design and manufacture unique neutron detectors for the company’s SMR design.",
            "Although currently the NuScale’s is the only SMR with design approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Reuter-Stokes is clear in its ambition to become the go-to supplier for neutron detectors right across the SMR industry by leveraging the company’s experience. Daniel Schreiner, Nuclear Product Manager, for Reuter-Stokes, explains: “From a Reuter-Stokes perspective we want to work right across the sector. Our detectors are essentially reactor technology agnostic. They can work with any kind of reactor, just as long as it generates neutrons.”",
            "The first NuScale project to use the detectors, which are being developed in partnership with Paragon Energy Solutions, will be the Carbon Free Power Project (CFPP) in Idaho Falls, Idaho, which will see the first VOYGR SMR power plant installed. It is scheduled to begin generating power in 2029. Reuter-Stokes’ detector assemblies will be responsible for monitoring the fission rate while Paragon will develop the signal processing electronics and also the associated reactor protection system. “Our partnership with Paragon, where customers can realise our combined offering of detection technology and control system technology is unique,” says Martinez.",
            "For neutron detection, the major difference between large-scale boiling water reactors and pressurized water reactors (BWRs and PWRs) is the physical location of the neutron detector. That location drives the geometry and the size.",
            "“For the boiling water reactor fleet our detectors are located inside the nuclear core right next to the fuel bundles. Since they’re very close to the fissioning fuel the detectors can be quite small. On a pressurized water reactor our detectors are located outside of the nuclear core, maybe one or two meters away so they see significantly less neutron flux. Therefore, the neutron detectors are substantially larger and could be up to, say, 40 inches (100 cm),” says Schreiner.",
            "For small modular reactors, companies are developing reactors based on both PWR and, less frequently, BWR technologies. “While the majority of the market is going the PWR route there are some boiling water reactors currently being designed,” says Martinez, adding: “Just about everything else is a pressurised water reactor, such as NuScale, Holtech and Rolls Royce but there’s also some others that are being developed. While they’re well understood and have been theoretically worked on for decades we’re getting to the point where we’re going to construct new fourth generation plants like high-temperature gas reactors or liquid metal reactors so there’s quite a bit of variation out there. Every one has their own pros and cons.”",
            "As Schreiner observes: “We would love to make just a generic detector that worked for everyone but what we’re seeing is that the different SMR developers are different enough that we are going to have to develop bespoke detector designs for each developer. A NuScale reactor detector design is not going to work for an X-Energy reactor detector design and so on. Each one of these reactors is different and is going to require a little bit of engineering work to custom fit our detectors to that specific technology. They’re potentially each going to need a separate design and qualification effort.” For example, on the large gigawatt-scale reactors all of the Reuter-Stokes detectors are of the fission chamber type. However, for small modular reactors, because of the differing technical parameters like temperature and neutron flux, it is possible to use ionization chambers in some instances as well. Because ionization chambers do not contain uranium they don’t require special nuclear material considerations that affect things like logistics regulations. That potentially is another benefit particularly associated with SMR technologies which are designed to be easily transported to site.",
            "Nonetheless, the challenge of new reactor designs new market entrants is picked up by Martinez, who says: “They’ve done a lot of research, but are now in a commercialization phase addressing the challenges and developing the sciences to deliver an SMR facility and all the benefits that brings. We are helping these companies design what they actually need for their particular reactor design from a sensor side with practical experience. We’re already well established and we can help to make the discovery phase and design phase a bit easier. Luckily, that’s one of our sweet spots.”",
            "Phased detector development",
            "To ease the design and qualification process, Reuter-Stokes has launched a three phase programme for SMR developers. “We’ve developed this phased process to try to help in terms of risk management and cost management,” says Schreiner. The problem is that SMR developers don’t always have all the answers when considering neutron detection. “We can’t go directly into detailed design without really understanding what the requirements are for these detectors, the technical specifications and the acceptance criteria for example,” Schreiner says. However, he adds: “Since we’ve been in business for so long, we do have a large catalogue. We have thousands of different detector designs that are both fission chamber-based",
            "and also ionization chamber types. When a new customer comes in and details the neutron flux, the temperature, and the sensitivity required our physicists can go into this database and find two or three detectors that are close. We can use that as the foundation for a custom product offering. We’re not starting from scratch with detailed engineering, we’re starting from maybe anywhere from the 60 to 80 percent complete phase.”",
            "This allows a two to six month front-end engineering effort to be launched – phase one preliminary design – working with the SMR developer and the SMR fuels engineer and talking directly to detector physicists to explore issues such as the location of the detector, what the environment looks like at that specific location and then which detectors from the catalogue could work for this application.",
            "“Once that process is complete now both sides have a really good understanding of what this technical specification looks like. Then the SMR developer can publish its technical specification and we’ll provide a fixed-term quote on phase two, which is detailed design and building a prototype detector to validate all of the physics models and manufacturing processes,” says Schreiner.",
            "Once phase two is complete the process can move to qualification with the relevant nuclear regulatory authorities. “It’s a very rigorous and methodical qualification process for a nuclear safety-related detector to ensure that the detector has been qualified for the safe operation start up and shut down of a nuclear reactor. It’s a huge investment both in design and time and in dollars to get that qualification. Reuter-Stokes’ experience of going through the qualification process helps when it comes to new designs and new types of sensors,” explains Schreiner. He concludes: “It’s mitigating risk and making sure that we control costs as we progress through the phases so that we’re constantly incorporating the lessons learned as we continue to work on the project with the customer”.",
            "The pressure is on all SMR developers to keep costs down as low as possible and Martinez makes a key observation: “The most important thing in terms of making things cheaper is you got to think about it early in the process. If we can have our detector physicists talking directly to the fuels engineer and they can work out where these detectors go before the SMR design is locked in that allows the widest range of detectors that we can choose from our off the shelf database.”",
            "It’s simple steps like this that will ensure the supply chain can support SMR development in making its ambitions a reality."

            "The US Department of Energy (DOE) notes that a fusion reactor has to produce high performance plasma with low-cost magnetic fields. As a result, the CSC must be designed and fabricated with exceedingly tight tolerances to meet exacting metrology and magnetic permeability requirements. The CSC will provide the inner vacuum wall of the NSTX and structural support for plasma-facing components and coils. These will have to withstand a 10-million-degree Celsius thermal environment.",
            "The challenging design meant that Holtec’s weld engineers needed to develop and qualify many unique welding procedures and tools to meet PPPL’s requirements. These were rigorously implemented by Holtec’s machinists and welders qualified and certified under DOE’s Quality Assurance Programme.",
            "Professor Steve Cowley, Lab Director at PPPL, noted: “This beautiful piece of inconel metal – which I fondly call ‘the hedgehog’ due to its stud-covered design – will hold the centre magnet of our flagship experiment, NSTX-U.” He added: “The casing is not only magnificent, but well-travelled: It was forged in Italy, machined in New Jersey, and assembled in Pittsburgh. Its final arrival to us at the Lab was a significant project milestone and will allow us to begin important recovery work.”",
            "This work depended on the close partnership between PPPL and Oak Ridge Technologies, a joint venture between Holtec International and Gilmartin Engineering Works. This enabled the final design of this component to be matured iteratively. “To fabricate something of this calibre required expertise and weldments of the highest quality,” said Brian Farnsworth, Holtec Director of Weld Technology. “I am immensely proud of our team’s dedication and diligence to produce this critical component which in our initial review appeared to be almost unachievable.”",
            "The NSTX-U is the flagship fusion facility at PPPL. The spherical device is shaped more like a cored apple than the doughnut-like shape of conventional tokamaks.

In a recent meeting with Indian Ambassador to the USA Amarjit S. Sandhu, Holtec CEO Dr Kris Singh said replacing coal with nuclear power produced by Holtec’s SMR-160 was a “game changer for India and the global environment” by enabling coal-fired plants to switch from fossil fuel to uranium while preserving existing coal plants’ assets.",
            "Holtec’s SMR-160 advanced small modular reactor (SMR) is a pressurised light-water reactor, generating 160MWe (525MWt) using low-enriched uranium fuel, with flexibility to produce process heat for industrial applications and hydrogen production.",
            "The latest breakthrough involves the use of multi-stage compressors capable of uprating the SMR-160’s relatively low enthalpy steam (700 psi at 595 degrees F) to the elevated pressure and superheat needed to run the turbogenerator of a fossil power plant. “The needed enthalpy boost can be modified to support continued operation of any plant’s turbogenerator, and in most cases would not require any external energy input,” Holtec says. A provisional patent application has been filed paving the way to repurpose any coal-fired plant by replacing its coal-fired boiler with clean steam from the SMR-160 plant.",
            "The ability for SMR-160 to deliver steam at any desired pressure would also enable the use of high-pressure steam as feed stock for industrial applications or to provide low pressure steam for district heating to cities and municipalities, Holtec claims.",

This new HI-CUT segmentation technology was first used at Indian Point Unit 3 on 18 November 2022 starting with dismemberment of the reactor’s upper reactor vessel internals. According to Holtec, “The device’s performance exceeded expectations, reaching more than double the projected severance rates and upset-free operations for the past seven weeks.” HI-CUT is now deemed critical to the safe and efficient decommissioning of all three reactors at Indian Point.",
            "The device underwent stringent testing before being deployed during which materials harder than severely irradiated reactor material (ASTM A-300), emulating the hardness of topaz, were cut in simulated conditions. “The results of the tests informed the equipment’s design,” Hoiltec noted. “An extensive operator training program including underwater testing of the HI-CUT system and a full-scale mock-up of the down-ending of the upper reactor vessel internals was completed prior to the system’s deployment which was instrumental in ensuring its success in the first attempt at the site. Special attention was paid to the development of a solid rigging and handling plan to handle parts under water which weighed in excess of 50 metric tons.”",

This assessment aims to assess the safety, security, and environmental protection aspects of any nuclear power plant design that is intended to be deployed in the UK.",
            "In May 2021, BEIS opened the GDA process to advanced nuclear technologies, including small modular reactors (SMRs). Successful completion of the GDA culminates in the issue of a Design Acceptance Confirmation from the ONR and a Statement of Design Acceptability from the EA. Rolls-Royce SMR was the first vendor to submit an application for a GDA of an SMR design. Its 470 MWe pressurised water reactor design was accepted for review in March 2022. In December, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy submitted a GDA entry application for its BWRX-300 SMR, and Holtec International has stated its intention to submit an application for its SMR-160 design.",
            "UK Atomics molten salt reactor design uses unpressurised heavy water as a moderator, while the reactor is intended to burn nuclear waste while breeding new fuel from thorium. The company says, with an output of 100 MWt, it is small enough to allow for mass manufacturing and assembly line production.",
            "UK Atomics CEO and co-founder Thomas Steenberg said the technology “has the added benefit of producing no greenhouse gas emissions and it does consume long-term nuclear waste from the classic nuclear industry to produce energy”. A mock-up of the reactor has been constructed at the company’s facility in Copenhagen which \"will be tested to support the goal-oriented approval process\".",
            "Copenhagen Atomics claims that the reactors will be deployed by UK Atomics, which will build, own and operate a fleet of autonomous reactors, \"eventually numbering in thousands\". This business model, selling energy-as-a-service, will enable a cost-effective and low-risk deployment, it says. The timeline it has set for operation of its first commercial reactor is 2028. The company further claims that, with low operating costs and no capital expenditure to the customer, it projects an electricity price below £40 ($48) per MWh.",
            "\"We are removing the complexity for decision makers,\" said Copenhagen Atomics cofounder Thomas Jam Pedersen. \"Companies fear the responsibility of operating a nuclear plant, decommissioning, and handling nuclear waste. We take care of all of that and just deliver reliable and green energy to the customer.\"",
            "The company was founded in 2014 by a group of scientists and engineers meeting at Technical University of Denmark and around the greater Copenhagen area for discussions on thorium and molten salt reactors, who incorporated in 2015. The following year, the company became part of European nuclear molten salt research consortium MIMOSA.",
            "Copenhagen Atomics currently markets some of their technologies commercially including pumped molten salt loops for use in molten salt reactor research, as well as highly purified salts for high temperature concentrated solar power, molten salt energy storage, and molten salt chemistry research.",
            "Recently the company raised €20m ($21.2m) to accelerate the development of its thorium molten salt reactor technology. Pedersen said the funding will support its plans to have the first commercial reactors online in 2028. The company says it is planning to test a prototype in Copenhagen in 2023. However, according to the company website, it planned non-radioactive testing of its prototype in 2022 and would then identify a country to test the radioactive version in preparation for mass production on assembly lines in 2030.",
            "According to Pederson, the company has specialised in producing molten salts, particularly fluoride salts, which are being used for early-stage testing of reactor components. Radioactive testing will not take place in Denmark, which has no state agency able to approve that sort of research. “I don’t know exactly which country will be the best for us,” he said, noting that Canada, the USA, and other European countries are all on the table.",
            "The company notes that molten salt reactors are not a new concept as they underwent significant testing in the 1950s and 1960s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fuelled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants, one of which was a molten salt breeder reactor with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation.",
            "According to Pederson, testing stopped in part because thorium was not well-suited for weapons production. “It was, from the very get-go, far behind the investments in the uranium fuel cycle, and therefore, most people were educated in the uranium fuel cycle,” he said. However, in the late 2000s documents from the ORNL tests were released to the public. “People started to discover, ‘Oh, there’s actually something here that is quite exciting.’ Because thorium is the only element where you can make a breeder cycle, or breeder reactor, in thermal spectrum.”",
            "While there is now renewed interest in MSR technology with numerous designs being developed in the US, Europe and Russia, there are, as yet, no projects anywhere near realisation."

            "Five major companies have made key announcements on their plans to advance small modular reactor (SMR) deployment in the UK. While Rolls-Royce SMR shortlisted three sites for a factory to produce component for its planned SMR; Balfour Beatty and Holtec with Hyundai agreed to support plans for the construction of Holtec’s SMR-160; and GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) submitted a Generic Design Assessment (GDA) application for its BWRX-300 SMR to the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS).",
            "The three sites shortlisted by Rolls-Royce for its heavy pressure vessels (HPV) factory are: The International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) in Sunderland and South Tyneside (northeast England); Teesworks in Teesside (northeast England); and Gateway in Deeside (Wales). In July, Rolls-Royce SMR had named six potential locations for the factory, selected from more than 100 submissions from local enterprise partnerships and development agencies.",
            "Rolls-Royce SMR CEO Tom Samson, said this would be the first of at least three factories and will manufacture and assemble large and most complex components for a fleet of SMRs. He added: “To ensure commercial processes move in parallel, negotiations will be initiated when Rolls-Royce SMR has entered formal discussions on deployment with the Government.”",
            "The GBP100-200 million ($121-242m) factory is expected to cover 23,000 square metres and to create more than 200 permanent jobs. The other two factories will manufacture civils modules and mechanical electrical and plumbing (MEP) modules for transportation to SMR sites and assembly.",
            "The Rolls-Royce SMR design was accepted for GDA review in March after which BEIS asking the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the environment regulators for England and Wales to begin the process. It will have the capacity to generate 470MWe and will provide consistent baseload generation for at least 60 years. Rolls-Royce SMR aims to deploy multiple units at various sites totalling around 15GWe. The SMR is fully modularised with the reactor, some 16 by 4 metres being capable of transportation by road, rail or sea. Targeting a 500-day modular build, the firm says this concept minimises the onsite time and effort required to construct and build the plant, with about 90% of manufacturing and assembly activities carried out in factory conditions.",
            "In November, Rolls-Royce SMR announced that a siting assessment review had identified a range of existing NPP sites in the UK as possible hosts for its SMRs, with four sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) prioritised. These were: Trawsfynydd (also requiring agreement with Cwmni Egino – Welsh Government); Sellafield (NDA land availability to be confirmed); Wylfa – South and Oldbury – North (both requiring agreement with Horizon Nuclear Power). Rolls-Royce identified four other sites which needed further investigation.",
            "Meanwhile, Balfour Beatty has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Holtec Britain, a subsidiary of US-based Holtec International, to support “the planning advancement for the construction of Holtec’s SMR-160 pressurised light-water reactors in the UK”. Balfour Beatty will act as the main UK construction partner in collaboration with Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co Ltd (Hyundai E&C).",
            "In October, Holtec International and Hyundai E&C signed an agreement to launch an accelerated programme to complete the balance of plant design of the remaining systems and structures for the SMR-160 advanced small modular reactor (SMR). The SMR-160 is a pressurised light-water reactor, generating 160MWe (525MWt) using low-enriched uranium fuel, with flexibility to produce process heat for industrial applications and hydrogen production.",
            "Holtec International plans to submit a GDA application for the SMR-160 in 2023 with the aim of starting construction of the first UK unit in 2028. Holtec in November applied to BEIS for funding support for the GDA. The company said it intends to deploy 32 SMR-160s – representing a total capacity of 5,100 MWe – in serial production by 2050 to bring “reliable and affordable electricity and heat to UK households, businesses, and industrial users”.",
            "Holtec has also joined a consortium with 15 major companies to establish the Moorside Clean Energy Hub in North West England. This includes a number of nuclear projects at Moorside, including a new UK-EPR pressurised water reactor together with “potentially a clutch of SMRs and other innovative technologies”.",
            "Holtec said that, under the agreement with Balfour and Hyundai E&C “the parties will develop the division of responsibilities for procurement, construction, and commissioning of SMR-160 plants in the UK in accordance with UK regulatory and industrial practices and with inclusion of UK suppliers”. They will also “jointly develop a cost estimate for deployment of the SMR-160 in the UK based on Holtec’s standard design developed for the US Market, while waiting for the UK Government to determine the process for site selection”.",
            "Holtec added that it has identified three potential UK sites with existing NPPs “suitable for hosting the first wave of Holtec SMR-160s, at Trawsfynydd in Wales and Heysham and Oldbury in England”. Holtec Britain Director Gareth Thomas noted: “We are advancing project delivery plans with our UK Team based on the information available for these sites and our corporate office committed to match funding the GDA with BEIS. Our GDA application provides incredible value for government’s money considering that SMR-160’s development has been essentially funded by Holtec for well over a decade and the requested governmental support is only for “gap funding” to complete the GDA process.”",
            "Another contender for the UK’s first SMR is North Carolina-based GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) which announced submission of a GDA entry application for the BWRX-300 SMR to BEIS. The BWRX-300 is a 300MWe water-cooled, natural circulation SMR with passive safety systems that leverages the design and licensing basis of GEH's ESBWR boiling water reactor. It is currently undergoing a pre-licensing Vendor Design Review by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).",
            "Ontario Power Generation (OPG) has selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment in Canada as early as 2028 and recently submitted its licence to construct application for the Darlington site to the CNSC. SaskPower and the US Tennessee Valley Authority have also selected the BWRX-300 for potential deployment. In Poland, ORLEN Synthos Green Energy (OSGE) started the pre-licensing process by applying to the National Atomic Energy Agency for assessment of the BWRX-300.",
            "Sean Sexstone, GEH Executive Vice President, Advanced Nuclear noted that the regulatory agencies in Canada and the US are collaborating on their licensing review of the BWRX-300. “Through the GDA process we look forward to engaging UK regulators and enabling collaboration with their global counterparts,” he said.",
            "GEH said it was supported in preparation of the GDA entry application by Jacobs UK, which has supported licensing applications for new nuclear power plant projects in the UK since 2007. In September, GEH and the The UK’s Sheffield Forgemasters agreed to cooperate in support of the potential deployment of the BWRX-300 in the UK. They agreed to discuss how the existing and future capabilities of Sheffield Forgemasters could help meet the potential demands of BWRX-300 deployment.",
            "In December 2021, Rolls-Royce SMR also signed a GBP3.7m contract with Sheffield Forgemasters to enable the first development forgings to be manufactured to support the deployment of Rolls-Royce SMRs. The race is clearly on. It remains to be seen who will be the winner.",

The Orano Group, part of the NorthStar decommissioning team, who acquired the plant from Entergy in 2019, said segmentation of the irradiated reactor core was carried out remotely underwater to ensure the highest level of safety.",
            "As well as Orano USA, the decommissioning team includes Waste Control Specialists and Burns & McDonnell. Orano is responsible for RPV segmentation, and providing support used fuel management. Waste Control Specialists provides waste management, packaging, transport and disposal, and Burns & McDonnell provides engineering and regulatory support.",
            "Orano said it used remote-controlled tools designed specifically for dismantling and which have proven their effectiveness in previous projects, particularly in Germany. The RPV, which was some 20 metres high and weighed several hundred tons, is the largest metal component of a BWR. Orano also packaged and transported the waste from the dismantling operations to a dedicated storage site, located in the West Texas region.",
            "Vermont Yankee stopped operating in December 2014 after 42 years of operation. In November 2016, Entergy announced the sale of the plant to NorthStar for accelerated decommissioning. In October 2018, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the transfer of Vermont Yankee's operating licences to NorthStar and the Vermont Public Utility Commission issued an order authorising the sale in December.",
            "In the meantime, Entergy had signed a contract with US-based Holtec International to expeditiously defuel the Vermont Yankee used fuel pool. The overall project scope included construction of a second Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) pad, security expansion, engineering, licensing, manufacturing, delivery and loading of 45 HI-STORM cask systems, all on a turnkey basis.",

            "As the nation’s largest source of carbon-free power, America’s current fleet of nuclear reactors is a vital resource for achieving the President’s goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035 and a net-zero emissions economy by 2050, DOE said.",
            "“This is a critical step toward ensuring that our domestic nuclear fleet will continue providing reliable and affordable power to Americans as the nation’s largest source of clean electricity,” said US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M Granholm. “Nuclear energy will help us meet President Biden’s climate goals, and with these historic investments in clean energy, we can protect these facilities and the communities they serve.”",
            "Nuclear power currently provides 50% of US carbon free electricity but shifting energy markets and other economic factors have already resulted in the early closures of 13 commercial reactors since 2013. These closures have led to an increase in carbon emissions in those regions, poorer air quality for residents living in the surrounding areas, and the loss of thousands of high-paying jobs.",
            "Units 1 and 2 at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant were scheduled to be decommissioned in 2024 and 2025, but the conditional award of credits, valued at up to $1.1 billion, will allow the plant to remain open. Final terms are subject to negotiation and finalisation by DOE. Diablo Canyon, owned and operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company, produces approximately 16 GWh of electricity annually, about 15% of the state’s clean energy. The award will save 1,500 jobs.",
            "As urged by the responses received from the public during the comment period earlier this year, the first CNC award cycle prioritised reactors facing the most imminent threat of closure, limiting applications to reactors that had already announced intentions to cease operations due to economic factors. The second CNC award cycle will prioritise reactors that are projected to shut down due to economic factors within the next four years. DOE is expected to begin accepting applications for the second cycle of CNC funding in January 2023.",
            "However, a proposal to restart the Palisades NPP along Lake Michigan depended on federal government approval, which has been denied. The plant on the shores of Lake Michigan closed in May and Holtec International bought the plant in June, with the goal of decommissioning it by 2041. Holtec had applied for CNC programme, hoping to restart the plant but the application was denied on 18 November.",

The parties will also develop a cost estimate for deployment of the SMR-160 standard design.",
            "This came after a Memorandum of Agreement (MOU) signed between Holtec and the Czech power company ČEZ in September. Holtec has been working with ČEZ since 2019, supporting their technical and commercial evaluation of SMR-160 for deployment in Czech Republic and a feasibility study performed under an MOU and technical exchange with ÚJV Řež. The MOU with ČEZ enables continued exchange between the parties for evaluation of SMR-160 deployment at Temelin, where ČEZ plans to deploy a pilot small modular reactor (SMR) as early as 2032. ČEZ is also evaluating future deployment of SMRs to replace several coal power plants planned for shutdown in the late-2030’s. Deployment nuclear power at these sites is seen as important to ensure stability of the Czech electricity grid.",
            "On a wider front, Holtec has been engaged in a formal technical exchange on the SMR-160 with the Czech Ministry of Industry and Trade looking at broader applications for SMRs, such as district heating and industrial processes. Holtec has been engaged with electricity intensive consumers in the industrial and transportation sectors in the Czech Republic as future end-users power and heat produced by SMR-160. Holtec’s European Programme Manager Rafael Marin noted, “SMR-160 modules are an ideal fit in terms of thermal and electrical power production for district heating and industrial applications. We can build as many SMR-160 modules as needed to meet the demands of the site, including traditional grid-scale electricity applications with 4-8 units deployed at a single location. In addition, SMR-160 is based on pressurised water reactor (PWR) technology and uses same fuel assembly type and enrichment levels that are in operation in PWRs plants currently, making SMR-160 licensing friendly.”",
            "Holtec and Korea’s HDEC signed an agreement last November for completion of the standard design of the SMR-160 plant and delivery of SMR-160 projects worldwide. HDEC has constructed 18 nuclear plants in South Korea as well as four APR-1400 units in the United Arab Emirates. HDEC has an annual revenue of over $16 billion. Škoda Praha is a Czech EPC contractor for power plants on turnkey basis. It has worked at the Czech Temelin and Dukovany NPPs as well as at the Bohunice V2 NPP in Slovakia.",
            "Holtec’s Senior Vice President of International Projects, Dr. Rick Springman, commented, “The importance of this Agreement should not be understated – it is the starting point for planning project execution of SMR-160s within the Czech and broader European context, supported by three companies with a reputation of delivering real projects in the nuclear sector. Holtec has over 36 years of experience delivering nuclear equipment, HDEC brings 50 years of continuous nuclear power plant construction experience, and Škoda Praha brings experience executing EPC projects with understanding of the European labour and services market, along with specific knowledge of the Temelin site – I am not aware of any other SMR companies’ teams that can match this project delivery capability.”",

Hyundai E&C employees have been dispatched to the Indian Point NPP in the US to support the entire decommissioning process, including nuclear reactor segmentation and used nuclear fuel handling and management.",
            "President and CEO of Hyundai E&C Young-Joon Yoon said: “By accelerating completion of the SMR-160 development programme, we have further strengthened our cooperative relationship with Holtec paving the way for a wide array of collaborations. As a power plant project developer, Hyundai E&C has taken a giant step toward becoming a total solution provider for clean energy at all stages – from business discovery, planning, and development, to construction, including future new technology development. By entering the nuclear decommissioning market, we will be reborn as a ‘Total Solution Creator’ for the entire nuclear power plant life cycle including design, construction, spent nuclear fuel management and decommissioning.”",
            "Holtec International President and CEO Dr Kris Singh said: “We will be able to supply carbon-free energy worldwide with our SMR-160 advanced reactor, our green boiler and our nascent high energy solar concentrator facility to help combat global climate change while realising a shared business success with our valued partner, Hyundai E&C.”",

            "HI-HEAT district heating system",
            ", which has been underway since May 2020. The system design is complete and digitally verified. Certain miscellaneous laboratory tests to re-confirm the critical characteristics of the thermal capacitor material, Feorite, are underway to complete the quality documentation on the development programme.",
            "HI-HEAT is intended to provide a carbon-free solution for district heating in countries facing a cut-off of Russian fuel supplies as well as countries aiming to shrink the footprint of fossil fuels in their national economies, Holtec said. It is the low-pressure steam supply version of Holtec’s Green Boiler which is characterised by harnessing an external heat source such as surplus electrical energy available during off-peak hours or a co-located nuclear reactor (for example Holtec’s SMR-160) or the molten salt from a proximate solar power plant. The external thermal source is used to heat the HI-HEAT thermal capacitor, called Feorite, to elevated temperatures reaching 700 degrees C. A single shop-manufactured HI-HEAT module stores over 300 million BTUs of thermal energy in its Feorite capacitor which is enough to produce 300,000 pounds of steam.",
            "There is no limit on the number of modules that can be arrayed in parallel to achieve the rate of steam generation needed for a district.",
            "Holtec noted that the raw materials needed to manufacture the district heating system are typically available in every region of the world, which will facilitate their manufacture to occur locally under Holtec’s technical guidance. Even the thermal capacitor material, Feorite, can be sourced locally in most parts of the world.",
            "HI-HEAT is entirely based on the Green Boiler design platform and is configured to produce steam at a relatively low pressure. The Green Boiler design platform enables the system to be designed to produce steam at any pressure level and any level of superheat. The ability to produce high pressure/high superheat steam in the Green Boiler affords the opportunity to repurpose coal fired plants which would otherwise be completely dismantled. The high-pressure variant of the Green Boiler can be used to power the turbogenerators of existing coal fired boilers, which can be retired along with their coal and ash handling facilities. Thus, by installing the Green Boiler, much of the existing infrastructure of the coal plant can be saved and re-used.",
            "Holtec is now focused on integrating its Green Boiler technology with an innovative solar energy collection technology to provide a clean source of high pressure/high temperature steam to support the production of hydrogen fuel, generation of electricity, as well as supply of process steam to proximate industries. We believe that the classical heliostat/receiver-based technology can be optimised to make it commercially competitive and practically viable.",

Holtec’s bid was joined by Spanish equipment manufacturer Equipos Nucleares SA (ENSA) as a consortium partner.",
            "Enresa cited several compelling reasons for their selection of the HI-STORM technology; among them: an extreme resistance to severe earthquakes, radiation blockage capability, the ability to store high heat-emitting fuel in high-capacity canisters and the ability to handle the whole range of fuel and high-level waste types needed by the plants.",
            "The scope of work envisaged by this award includes support for the licensing process in Spain, the design of the on-site storage facilities at the four nuclear sites, design, manufacturing and supply of the HI-STORM family of storage and transport systems, and all associated handling and processing ancillaries for the four sites. By employing the HI-STORM FW and HI-STAR 190 transport systems across the four sites, Enresa is expected to reduce their costs for used fuel and waste management across the board, and provide greater certainty to the plant operations.",
            "Holtec’s HI-STORM models are currently being deployed internationally at Angra in Brazil, Krsko in Slovenia, Sizewell B in the UK and Laguna Verde in Mexico, and at various US NPPs.",

HI-STAR 190 has a high heat-load capacity, enabling the fuel to be readily transported offsite shortly after loading. HI-STAR 190 is available in three lengths. It can be used to transport pressurised water reactor, boiling water reactor and VVER fuel. It is designed to serve as the work horse for Holtec’s HI-STORE Consolidated Interim Storage Facility in New Mexico and its counterpart – the Central Spent Fuel Storage Facility in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine.",

        "text": [
            "A small modular reactor (SMR) could be built in the Czech Republic at the Temelín NPP as early as 2032, Daniel Beneš, the Director of the ČEZ power group has said after signing a contract for the establishment of the South Bohemia Nuclear Park. South Bohemian Governor Martin Kuba, addressing an international conference, said: \"We realise that nuclear energy is something that we fundamentally need in the republic. \"Czech industry is not only driven by renewable sources, we are not Norway, which has unlimited water capacities and produces 95% of its energy with clean hydropower plants.\"",
            "This is why it was decided to establish the South Bohemian Energy Park, using the Temelin site to build the first SMR in Europe, including an educational centre for engineers, specialists and other technical professions, he added. \"We thus have a unique opportunity to participate in the construction and development of a technical background where experts from all over Europe can be educated.\"",
            "The joint company South Bohemia Nuclear Park aims to facilitate construction of the first pilot project at Temelín which offers a protected, research space, and the presence of professional staff to ensure a synergistic effect during planning, construction and operation.",
            "This project has the support of the government, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said. \"In the context of the situation in Europe, the signing of this agreement is an extremely important step. This is a landmark year, the war in Ukraine shook the international order, tested allied relations and showed the danger of dependence on resources and raw materials from risky countries,\" he noted",
            "\"Due to supply cuts, we are facing an unprecedented increase in the price of electricity and gas, a situation that threatens us and with which we must deal quickly,” he said. “The government is reacting to it with acute measures, but this is not enough, and that is why we are also working on longer-term solutions that will strengthen our energy security and independence,\" he explained, adding that it also involves building a SMR. \"These are smaller mass-produced devices that largely overcome some of the disadvantages of existing reactors. They could replace ageing power plants and heating plants,\" he concluded.",
            "Beneš emphasised that Temelin is the best possible place for the pilot project. \"At the same time, preparation for the construction of two new standard units continues. We are also working on the project of a new nuclear unit at the Dukovany NPP, where we expect offers by the end of November. These buildings are not in competition with the small modular reactors we are talking about.\" He added that SMRs are complementary technologies and are more suitable for a range of different locations. \"Everything is based on the energy mix, the Czech energy mix largely relies on nuclear energy.\"",
            "In the last year, the ČEZ Group has accelerated activities related to the SMR project, having already signed memorandums of cooperation with NuScale, GE Hitachi, Rolls Royce, EDF, KHNP and Holtec. Through its subsidiary ÚJV Řež, it is also developing SMRs locally. The HeFASTo project or the Energywell project are at an advanced stage of research and intensive cooperation is also underway with Westinghouse.",
            "\"There are seven companies in the world that deal with the preparation of such projects. We are in very active communication with all of them, we have signed memoranda of cooperation with them. They should put the first installations into operation before 2030. We have a feeling that these technologies will be ground-breaking. It makes sense to build the first pilot project next to the Temelín cooling towers.” He noted that some SMRs are almost as big as the nuclear units in Dukovany, but they are easier and faster to build than large nuclear reactors. He said the SMR in Temelín could be ready between 2032 and 2035.",
            "\"Given the current situation, we are accelerating this project. We see that it will be necessary to replace a number of coal-fired power plants and heating plants, while maintaining the maximum degree of self-sufficiency,” said Tomáš Pleskač, member of the ČEZ board of directors and director of the nuclear energy division. “SMRs are a safe and very efficient option from this point of view. \"",
            "The South Bohemian Nuclear Park is a joint project of all parties involved, covering research, development, communication and preparation of the building itself. However, an investor for the SMR has not been decided and investment costs have not yet been estimated.",

            "US-based Holtec International has welcomed the passage of the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), “which includes landmark provisions to support deployment of nuclear power and other clean energy technologies”. It added: “This Act will turbocharge the rise of nuclear energy in the US, including Holtec’s SMR-160 small modular reactor power plants, which are engineered to provide clean, reliable 24/7 power from their unconditionally safe reactors.” Holtec said it envisioned the SMR-160 “as the centrepiece of a distributed clean energy eco-system, coupled with our Clean Energy Storage and Generation (CESG) technology, meeting the diverse needs of local economies, providing dispatchable electricity to meet peaking demands, and processing steam for industrial use, such as production of hydrogen fuel”.",
            "The IRA tax incentives mean the SMR-160 nuclear plants are poised to deliver electricity “at market-competitive prices in both regulated and unregulated markets in the US, even considering the first-of-kind investment costs”, Holtex noted. “The incentives will accelerate broad SMR deployment, driving down the SMR-160 costs with mass produced components at Holtec’s US manufacturing facilities.”",
            "Holtec said that thanks the US government support it had “significantly boosted its clean energy research and development budget to bring the first SMR-160 online as early as 2029 – one year earlier than previously scheduled”. Holtec has already submitted a $7.4 billion application to the US Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office to increase the capacity for SMR production at its existing US manufacturing facilities, to construct and commission four SMR-160 plants in the US, and to build a new Holtec Heavy Industries (HHI) complex for higher capacity manufacturing of SMR-160 components, modules and weldments.",
            "“Holtec’s large federal loan request and erection of the largest nuclear manufacturing plant in the US are of a piece with our belief that the Inflation Reduction Act will unleash a massive growth across the country of base load and dispatchable clean energy plants uniquely provided by nuclear power and pave the way to a large global export market for the supply of US reactors.” Holtec is still evaluating the location of HHI and will likely build the proposed plant close to the site of its first SMR-160 project in the US. Candidate sites include Holtec’s Oyster Creek, as well as several other nuclear decommissioning sites owned by Holtec, undergoing decommissioning by subsidiary, Holtec Decommissioning International.",
            "There are also nuclear, coal and greenfield sites under specific consideration by several nuclear operators in the US, such as Entergy. Site-specific plant layouts and environmental monitoring necessary to support the Construction Permit Application (CPA) are already underway for Oyster Creek. The support and enthusiasm of a state to host this new industry are likely to play a decisive role in siting the first SMR-160s and the new manufacturing plant, Holtec said.",
            "“We expect to pair the SMR-160 plant with a Clean Energy Storage and Generation (CESG) system, the Green Boiler. A Green Boiler facility can store surplus energy from an SMR-160 power plant, and generally from the grid in periods of excess generation, then deliver that stored energy in times of generation deficit. A variation of the CESG system called HI-HEAT has been engineered to provide district heating systems, to enable countries lacking fossil fuel heat in winter months to heat their urban centres.",

The away-from-reactor facility will serve units 1 and 2 of KKNPP in the state of Tamil Nadu. KKNPP uses Russian-designed VVER 1000 reactors.",

            "US-based Holtec Intrnational is moving forward on its $7.4 billion plan to build up to four small modular reactors (SMRs) and a \"supersize\" reactor factory in New Jersey. Holtec said it had submitted Part II of a federal loan application to the Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Program Office. DOE had approved Part I of Holtec's application in March.",
            "Holtec's loan application said: “Our Camden and Pittsburgh based plants, both equipped to manufacture heavy capital equipment of the kind needed in SMRs, currently produce nearly 1,000 pieces of heavy equipment and weldments each year. The advanced manufacturing capabilities located in Camden will be enlarged with additional machining, robotic welding, and material handling equipment to increase the throughput of SMR-160 components to help meet the projected rise in demand for the SMR-160s expected in the next decade.”",
            "Holtec added: “The new giga-manufacturing facility, to be built at a yet unidentified location, will be a much larger version of the modern heavy fabrication plant on Holtec’s Camden technology headquarters that the Company commissioned in 2017. Holtec plans to build the new facility, tentatively named Holtec Heavy Industries, to materially improve America’s nuclear manufacturing capacity, and to make it available to other nuclear plant suppliers with capital hardware needs.”",
            "Holtec also reported that NPP operator Entergy Corporation had entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with Holtec, under which Entergy will evaluate the feasibility of deploying one or more SMR-160s on one or more of its existing sites within the Entergy service area. Entergy’s Chief Nuclear Office, Chris Bakken, noted, “Entergy will be evaluating Holtec’s SMR-160 system as a means to potentially help us meet our net-zero goals because of its inherent safety, modularity, operational simplicity, small footprint, and the proven light water reactor technologies that undergird it. Holtec’s established domestic manufacturing capacity, a strong balance sheet and their decades of proven performance in supporting our operating fleet also factored in our decision.”",
            "The loan application to DOE identifies several locations for the first SMR-160 plants, as any deployment requires securing the requisite financial support for the plant’s construction and a long-term purchase power agreement (PPA) from the candidate host states. In addition to Entergy’s service area as a potential location, the application mentions building the first SMR-160 at Holtec’s own Oyster Creek plant site (purchased from Exelon in 2018) in New Jersey, where Holtec already has a functioning state-of-the art manufacturing plant.",
            "“The new high-capacity manufacturing plant will likely be located in the region where the first SMR-160s will be deployed,” Holtec said. “Inevitably, the first mover state will become the leader in the emerging industry of small modular reactors with tens of thousands of new high-paying jobs in manufacturing, reactor support services, nuclear plant operations and related areas.”",

            "US-based Holtec International has announced that the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has issued the final environmental impact statement (EIS) for its proposed HI-STORE consolidated interim storage facility (CISF) for used nuclear fuel in Southeastern New Mexico.",
            "The 736-page final EIS includes the NRC staff’s recommendation that there are no environmental impacts that would preclude NRC from issuing a licence for environmental reasons. The recommendation is based on a review of Holtec’s licence application; consultation with Federal, State, Tribal and local agencies; input from other stakeholders; independent consultation with the New Mexico Bureau of Land Management; and NRC’s own environmental review. The NRC review included land use, transportation, geology and soils, surface and groundwater, ecological resources such as threatened and endangered species, noise, historical and cultural resources, public and occupational health, environmental justice, socioeconomics, and other considerations.",
            "The final EIS also confirms that there are no adverse impacts to other enterprises in the area including oil and gas, ranching, and farming. Designed with safety and environmental stewardship as the overriding considerations, the completely welded and hermetically closed canisters that will be safely stored at the facility are designed, qualified, and tested to maintain their integrity and prevent the release of radioactive material under the most adverse accident scenarios postulated by NRC regulations for both storage and transportation.",
            "Holtec International and its partner, the Eddy-Lea Energy Alliance (ELEA) of New Mexico, launched the initiative to establish the autonomous CISF in Southeastern New Mexico on a parcel of land owned by ELEA in 2015. ELEA selected Holtec and its underground HI-STORM UMAX fuel storage system after determining it to be the safest technology for their community. Holtec says the HI-STORM UMAX underground storage system “provides an unconditionally safe and secure, non-permanent, readily retrievable, and centralised facility for interim storage of the nation’s spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste until such time that a permanent solution is available”.",
            "“We believe that aggregating used fuel from 75 dispersed sites across the country is both a national security imperative and an essential predicate for the rise of renascent nuclear energy to meet our Nation’s clean energy goals,” said Holtec CEO Dr Kris Singh.",
            "The initial application for the HI-STORE CISF includes storage of up to 8,680 metric tons of uranium in commercial used nuclear fuel (500 canisters) with future amendments for up to a total of 10,000 storage canisters. The USA currently has more than 80,000 metric tons of used nuclear fuel in storage and the inventory increases by 2,000 metric-tons a year. HI-STORE CISF is being licensed using Holtec’s own funds with the support from communities in Southeastern New Mexico incorporated as ELEA.",
            "The HI-STORM UMAX system is already in use at two sites in the USA. It stores stainless-steel canisters containing used fuel or high-level waste entirely below-ground establishing a “security-friendly” storage facility, providing a clear, unobstructed view of the entire CISF from any location. The HI-STORM UMAX is physically sized to store all canisters currently licensed for storage of used nuclear fuel in the USA and all nuclear fuel types currently in use. John Heaton, ELEA Vice Chairman said the project “will diversify our economy, generate 350 jobs and potentially be a $3 billion investment in our area”.",
            "NRC said Holtec proposes initially to store 500 canisters holding approximately 8,680 metric tons of used fuel in a first phase and eventually to store up to 10,000 canisters in an additional 19 phases. The canisters would be transported by rail from operating, decommissioning, and decommissioned commercial US NPPs.",
            "NRC published a draft EIS for public comment in March 2020 and the public comment period was extended to six months because of the COVID pandemic. During that time, the NRC staff held six online public meetings to present the draft EIS and receive public comments.",
            "More than 4,800 comment submissions with 3,718 individual comments were received and addressed in the final EIS.",
            "“Publication of the final EIS completes the environmental portion of the NRC’s licensing review,” NRC said. “The staff will make a licensing decision following completion of its safety evaluation report, expected in January 2023.",

            "Holtec International has announced the HI-HEAT District Heater System that would end reliance on burning gas to heat homes and businesses around the world, “especially the East European democracies desperately dependent on it during the winter months”.",
            "The system comprises two modules called the Preservator and the Steam Chest. The Preservator preserves stored heat, while the Steam Chest, a smaller insulated vessel, serves to maintain maintains an inventory of steam to stabilise the supply system. With no moving parts or \"life-limiting constituents\", Holtec said.",
            "The largest factory-manufactured system envisaged is the HI-HEAT 100, a 29.3 MWh system that can deliver cycle steam at the desired rate of flow to a district heating grid. \"If adequately replenished with intermittent surplus electric power from the grid, the HI-HEAT systems can be sized to deliver heating steam continuously and indefinitely. Because there is no limit on the number of systems that can be deployed in parallel at any site, there is no limit on the supply of steam available for district heating or any other application.\"",
            "The HI-HEAT system is charged by the surplus power from the grid, i.e., when the available power exceeds the concomitant consumption. The source of electrical energy, preferably nuclear, solar or wind, may be hundreds of miles away from the district heater.",
            "HI-HEAT 100 is the largest practical system that can be shop manufactured and field installed. A smaller capacity HI-HEAT, say HI-HEAT 60 (60 million BTU or 17.6 MWh capacity) will be 60% of the height of HI-HEAT 100 but will be otherwise identical in anatomical details.",
            "The HI-HEAT system has no moving parts or life-limiting constituents and thus should be reasonably expected to serve satisfactorily for many, many decades, Holtec noted. Unlike Lithium-ion batteries, the decommissioning of the HI-HEAT system will involve no disposal of hazardous materials.",
            "In most cases, HI-HEAT 100 will simply retire and replace the existing gas boiler. Holtec expects to manufacture the HI-HEAT systems locally in the region where they will be used. 90% of the materials needed to build the system can be sourced locally. Having the HI-HEAT systems erected and commissioned during the coming winter in gas-shortage afflicted areas is feasible.",
            "“We think burning gas extracted from the land to pollute the environment is scandalous misuse of a natural resource that is best used to manufacture valuable industrial materials such as chemicals, plastics and the like,” said Holtec’s CEO and Chief Technology Officer, Dr Kris Singh. “We envision the HI-HEAT district heating systems to be powered by the operating nuclear plants in the near term and by our SMR-160 advanced light water reactors in the next decade when we hope to begin commissioning our reactors in increasingly larger numbers to decarbonise the global environment.”",

            "Big Rock Point, located in Charlevoix Michigan, shutdown in 1997 and was decommissioned in the early 2000’s. Only the used fuel remains at the Big Rock Point site.",
            "Holtec and Palisades personnel have been working methodically on an integrated transition plan, which has laid the foundation for decommissioning of the site. The first substantial activity will be moving the plant’s used fuel from the pool to robust transportable canisters in structurally-impregnable dry storage systems.",
            "Decommissioning of Palisades will benefit from the fully implemented fleet model, called the Holtec Management Model, which envisages an integrated fleet management structure that unifies the array of safety, operation, quality assurance and management procedures/practices, which are continuously informed by the lessons learned from decommissioning activities at each Holtec-owned decommissioning site. The Palisades decommissioning project will take 19 years, with the projected completion of transfer of fuel from wet to dry storage by 2025.",
            "With completion of Palisades decommissioning the site will be fit for commercial/industrial use, except for a small parcel of land where the dry storage casks will reside under rigorous security guarded by personnel from Holtec Security International. Holtec hopes to ship the multi-purpose canisters containing the used fuel to Holtec’s proposed consolidated interim storage facility in Southeastern New Mexico, called HI-STORE CISF, which is undergoing the final stage of licensing review by the NRC.",
            "Among the viable proposals for re-purposing the Big Rock Point and Palisades sites, is building Holtec’s SMR-160 advanced light water reactor, the firsts of which are scheduled to enter service in around 2030.",
